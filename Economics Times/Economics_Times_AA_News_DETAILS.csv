NextWASHINGTON DC: In a new study, researchers have discovered important differences in the biological pathways that lead to cancer for alcoholic fatty liver disease compared to a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease The findings of the study presented at the Experimental Biology meeting 2019, could benefit more than 3 million people diagnosed with fatty liver disease each year.The build-up of fat in the liver known as fatty liver disease sometimes leads to hard-to-treat liver cancer Scientists have not been able to understand why the cancer risk is higher for fatty liver disease caused by excessive alcohol consumption than for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes.""We want to find out the key factors and pathways that lead to liver cancer in fatty liver patients so we can slow or even prevent the liver cancer. It is estimated that this type of liver cancer is responsible for 250,000 to 1 million deaths each year,"" said Yue Jia, who conducted the study.In the study, the researchers examined expression levels of proteins in liver biopsies from a group of patients with alcoholic fatty liver disease and a group with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.The proteins studied are involved in epigenetic regulation, which controls gene expression, and inflammation, which plays an important role in the disease.The researchers observed that the two groups of patients showed significant differences in the expression of proteins involved in epigenetic regulators and inflammation.Importantly, these differences matched the ratio of liver cancer development seen for the two groups.""If through additional studies, we can prove that the molecules and pathways we identified modulate liver cancer development in the alcoholic fatty liver disease or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients, it may help identify new targets for preventing or reducing the risk of liver cancer that arises from other liver diseases,"" said Jia.The researchers plan to perform additional experiments in animal models of fatty liver disease to learn more about how epigenetic regulation and inflammation pathways lead to liver cancer.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-does-more-harm-than-you-know-may-up-cancer-risk/articleshow/68774062.cms
Virtual trolls may not stay anonymous for long,['Anandita Singh Mankotia'],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-68731873,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-428059,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2019-04-05T07:53:00,"The government is looking at ways to curb trolls on social media platforms such as Twitter , including mandatory verification of accounts by linking them to mobile phone numbers or official IDs, senior officials said. This will apply both to existing as well as new users.“The general perception is that I can remain anonymous in the internet space and say and do things without any fear,” an official told ET. “However, we need to maintain the balance between an individual’s need for privacy while ensuring we don’t encourage negative things on the internet.”Trolls and propagators of fake news operate with impunity because of their anonymity.“(There is need for) Some sort of mandatory verification, such as linking accounts to mobile phones and hence verification through a one-time password, like Twitter is already offering to users, or linking it to Aadhaar, the passport or any new foolproof methodology — (it’s) completely up to the intermediary (to decide),” said a second official.A Twitter account can be opened with a mobile phone number or an email ID. But fake email IDs can be set up to open an account, which means it’s not an infallible verification mechanism, the person said.The government wants to balance the need to uphold privacy while ensuring accountability.“This doesn’t mean my name or picture has to necessarily be linked to my account,” said one of the persons. “These details needn’t pop up each time with my account, but there should be some way for law enforcement agencies or at least for the platform to verify that I am who I claim to be.” To safeguard privacy, the data will stay with the intermediary, and law enforcement agencies will seek account details only when a cybercrime takes place or if there is a complaint of harassment.The officials said account verification won’t be part of the intermediary guidelines that the government aims to issue later this year. These guidelines seek to tighten accountability rules for social media apps through proposed measures such as penalties and jail terms for company executives for violations, ET had reprted last month.The guidelines are likely to include traceability of messages to pinpoint their origin, and securing consent of users before they are added to chat groups. WhatsApp introduced a new privacy feature on Wednesday that will require a user’s assent before he is added to a chat group — a step that aligns with the latter requirement. Mandatory verification will help check unacceptable behaviour and “deter needless trolling”, said the first official.Asked whether Twitter would be open to following a mandatory verification process for all its users, the company referred ET to its blogpost which said its public verification process was currently closed.“With the upcoming elections, we are working with Indian political parties to verify candidates, elected officials, and relevant party officials whose accounts will be active in the public conversation,” Twitter said. “To be clear, the parties themselves select the accounts for verification and then we review these accounts to ensure they meet our verification standards.” Twitter said the idea was to verify the accounts to empower a healthy engagement during elections and ensure that public figures are indeed who they claim to be.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/virtual-trolls-may-not-stay-anonymous-for-long/articleshow/68731808.cms
Alcoholic beverage makers to seek approvals for new labelling norms: FSSAI,[],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-68724774,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-11044,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2019-04-04T18:19:00,"NEW DELHI: Alcoholic beverage makers will seek approvals from excise commissioners to adopt new labelling norms, including statutory warnings on liquor bottles, food regulator FSSAI CEO Pawan Kumar Agarwal said Thursday.He hoped that the new set of labelling norms would be fully in place in six months.The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) had last year issued a regulation on alcoholic beverages and the same became effective from April 1.As per this regulation, all liquor bottles need to carry a statutory warning that ""consumption of alcohol is injurious to health.

Moreover, alcoholics beverages manufactured prior to April 1, 2019, can be sold in the market up to March 31, 2020.""I think for alcoholic beverages sector, the implementation of these standards is a significant way forward in order to improve the quality and standards of alcoholic beverages available in the country,"" Agarwal told reporters on the sidelines of a conference.""So far, it was primarily regulated by excise commissioners and they were only looking at alcoholic content and the toxic substances in alcohol. Now, there are far more elaborate standards that are benchmarked with the global standards and in certain cases, they have taken the Indian context also in consideration,"" he added.In addition to excise commissioners, the food safety commissioners would also look into the enforcement of these standards, Agarwal said.On the labelling norms, the FSSAI's CEO said the new labels including statutory warning would be fully effective from October 1.Alcohol makers would take approvals of excise commissioners for changes of labels, he said.""We are not changing norms for languages as it is a sensitive issue as in many states they do it in English and in other states, they do it in English as well as local languages,"" Agarwal said.The FSSAI's chief was speaking to reporters after launching EAT-Lancet Commission report 'Food Planet Health' in India.

The commission stated this in an affidavit, after the Supreme Court asked it to unequivocally state its stand on the anonymous nature of the bonds.The EC said it had raised its reservations as part of a 22-step reform package and another 47-step proposal. The commission, however, said it would rather not take a stand on the merits of the provisions in this case.NGO ADR (Association for Democratic Reforms), through activist lawyer Prashant Bhushan, had challenged several provisions in the law, including the ones that have done away with a cap on corporate funding through electoral bonds and allowed foreign funding. All these, the PIL petitioners argued, would adversely affect transparency in political funding and sought court intervention to ensure that these were done away with in larger public interest.According to Bhushan, data showed that 90% of the funds had gone to one party, that is the ruling party. He had also claimed that the anonymity of these bonds encouraged black money and money laundering. A bench led by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi is hearing the petition. The EC had also said this earlier. But it filed another affidavit throwing further light on its opposition to anonymous bonds and also removal of a provision that allowed only profitable companies to fund poll expenses.The commission pointed out to the court that it had urged the government to change the law to ensure greater accountability over party funding and expenses, but there was no political consensus on this.Almost all political parties are opposed to opening their accounts for audit, or their political funding public right down to the last penny. As per existing law, parties can accept only up to Rs 2,000 in cash; anything more than that must be through formal banking channels. However, they need not keep details of all anonymous donations through electoral bonds up to Rs 20,000.Parties have been claiming that they get a lion’s share of their funding through these anonymous bonds.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/we-opposed-anonymous-electoral-bonds-you-take-call-now-ec-tells-sc/articleshow/68606723.cms
Body basic: Alcohol doesn't go down well with women,['Malathy Iyer'],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-47663858,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-250673,overlay-etpanache/photo.jpg",2015-06-14T14:50:00,"MUMBAI: The gender gap in the world of tipplers is fast shrinking. Recent studies show that more female students than males in Spain are likely to binge-drink, and the percentage of women arrested for drunk driving increased by 30% within a decade in the US.In India, in the absence of any study or statistics, accidents like the one caused by Chembur corporate lawyer Janhvi Gadkar prove that drinking is losing its once-males-only character. S K Bhalla, chairman of Alcoholics Anonymous, said, “If you go to a pub, the number of men and women there is almost equal nowadays. Moreover, there are more women coming to AA meetings, but, they worryingly drop out.”This brings to the fore a latent point: are women and alcohol an unhealthy mixture?On one hand, manufacturers are wooing Indian women with specially brewed concoctions, but on the other, there are more instances of more rehab centres coming up only for women. A projection by NGO India Centre for Alcohol Studies in 2013 said that while Indian women made up only 5% of the tipplers, the number is likely to increase by 25% in the next five years.Dr Atul Ambekar of the National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi, said, “We psychiatrists can gather from the number of women seeking treatment that the incidence of drinking among them has increased.”Experts are concerned about women’s newfound fondness for Bacchus for physiological reasons. “For some reasons, alcohol doesn’t metabolize as quickly for women as it does for men. Inebriation is hence quicker for women than for men,” said senior consultant Dr Hemant Thacker from Jaslok Hospital on Pedder Road.A study from Notre Dame University in the US holds the lower volume of body water in women (as compared to men) responsible for intoxication. Experts say that if a man and woman of the same weight were to drink an equal amount of alcohol, the woman will have a higher alcohol concentration in her blood. A doctor said that women have lower levels of enzyme dehydrogenase that is needed to digest alcohol in the stomach.On more and more women taking to alcohol, city psychiatrist Dr Harish Shetty said, “Globalization has ensured that gender is not an issue as far as drinking is concerned. Previously, people on their way back home would go to the temple or a walk, but drinks are the new pastime for both working men and women.”Psychologist Mukta Puntambekar from Pune’s Muktangan Rehabilitation Centre said that women have a tendency to get carried away. “The transition from a social drinker to an addict is, as a result, faster for women than men,” she said. A telling commentary is the fact that Muktangan had to set up a rehab centre specially for women after it started getting more enquiries from them. “We have a 15-bed facility that is always booked. We have treated 700 women so far in the 15-to-75 age group,” she added.The reason young professionals drink, say doctors, is the thrill factor. “Many young professionals who seek help for alcoholism tell us that they like to drink and drive because they then feel they are literally flying. A sedan seems like an F18 jet and they feel immortal and powerful,” added Dr Shetty.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/Body-basic-Alcohol-doesnt-go-down-well-with-women/articleshow/47663852.cms
Bihar alcohol ban may be limited to country-made liquor,['Sanjay Ojha'],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-50038493,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-216183,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2015-12-04T11:00:00,"PATNA: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar may have seemed to suggest a complete ban on alcohol in the state from April 1 next year, but inquiries made to the revenue department officials suggest that considering a revenue deficit of Rs 5,500 cr that this will cause on the cash-strapped state, the ban will have to be limited to country-made liquor A reputed IMFL company official said the ban would be staggered at the very least. To substantiate his claim, he quoted Nitish as having said in his November 26 speech that ""affluent people know the side effects of alcohol, but people from weaker sections are unaware and they become even violent under the influence of liquor"".This, the official said, was a deliberately vague remark, leaving enough elbow room for the government to water down prohibition should economic advice suggest moderation.""Ban on country-made liquor will be effected first, and IMFL, if it's economically feasible, later,"" a revenue and excise department official told TOI on condition of anonymity.While excise from IMFL is Rs 2,500 crore and VAT Rs 1,000 cr, excise from country-made liquor is to the tune of Rs 1,500 crore. The total excise revenue is around Rs 4,000 crore and total VAT Rs 1,500 crore.Social scientist and researcher Rajesh Singh expressed similar views, pointing out that the state would need Rs 2.7 lakh crore over the next five years to implement the election promises made by the CM.""At least 100 to 120 crore bottles of country liquor are sold in the state every year with a good number of its consumers addicted to it. They will instantly develop health problems if they stop consuming liquor all of a sudden,"" Singh, who works among people suffering from alcohol abuse in Bihar and Jharkhand, said, adding that the ban, when it's implemented, will have to be partial.An excise official supported exemption on IMFL as it contributes to over two-thirds of revenue generation to the state's exchequer, although it accounts for only one-third of total liquor consumption in the state.Quoting the findings of Edelweiss Securities Ltd, the official said the firm has highlighted a few points on the proposed prohibition in Bihar.""Bihar is a small contributor to overall domestic IMFL sales though the sale of toddy and country liquor in the state is significant. At least 8 per cent of India's population which have low per capita income reside in Bihar, impacting the sale of country liquor more. There is thus every possibility that smuggling from neighbouring states would increase once the ban is effected,"" the official said, pointing out the state shares borders with Nepal, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal where liquor is not banned.""We can't even rule out the possibility of large-scale sale of spurious liquor and resultant casualties,"" the official said and hastened to add, however, that the bureaucracy and police are there to implement the order.Excise minister Abdul Jalil Mastan, however, maintained that the ban will be total. But his detractors said prohibition will also create livelihood loss of over 25,000 people directly involved in the business, and perhaps an equal number indirectly.Mastan said, ""If there will be ban, it will be complete and we will not tolerate its violation.""",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/Bihar-alcohol-ban-may-be-limited-to-country-made-liquor/articleshow/50038470.cms

India and the EU have been in talks on what is officially known as the Broadbased Investment and Trade Agreement since 2007.The talks have been stalled due to a plethora of reasons, beginning with a prolonged recession in the EU, its focus on concluding the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement with the US and then its move of banning 700 generic drugs tested in India. The Brexit dealt yet another blow to the talks.“With the UK out of the EU, Germany is expected to take the lead in the negotiations,” a Delhi-based expert on trade matters said on condition of anonymity. “So, there will be less aggression on services as this was the UK’s long-standing demand. But automobiles may become an important agenda.”The talks have also been stuck for four years on slashing of import duty on European cars and alcohol by India and recognising India as a ‘data-secure’ nation to enable free flow of data between India and the EU.

GST clears clutter of food bills but restaurateurs still skeptical,[],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-59408370,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-63521,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2017-07-02T11:36:00,"NEW DELHI: Restaurateur Zoravar Kalra was pleasantly surprised to see diners click photos of their bills at his restaurants on Saturday rather than that of dishes. Founder and managing director of Massive Restaurants, which runs 17 popular outlets across the country, such as Farzi Café, Masala Library and Kode, Zoravar said the biggest improvement in restaurant billing after implementation of GST has been cleaner bills that do not mention random break-ups.“Dining out had become a tricky affair as diners were not able to calculate their exact bills due to different slabs such as VAT, service tax , Swachh Bharat Cess and Krishi Kalyan Cess. Now they know that they have to pay Rs 18 for every Rs 100 spent on food . This makes planning your meal easier,” he observed. He added that though the difference in the total bill would be a mere one per cent – 18 per cent as compared to close to 19 per cent earlier – clarity will encourage diners to head out.While restaurant owners think it is too early to gauge the impact of GST on dining out or its benefit to consumers, simplified taxation is something they all welcome. Riyaaz Amlani, president of National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) and head of Impressario Entertainment and Hospitality that runs popular outlets Social, Smoke House and Slink & Bardot across India, welcomed GST as a “well- intentioned reform and a remarkable achievement of the government.” Riyaaz’s only demand from the government was to keep restaurants in the 12 per cent slab as compared to 18 per cent now.Keeping alcohol out of GST though has meant that many customers got two bills — one for alcohol that continues to attract a VAT of 20 per cent and another for food in air-conditioned outlets, fixed at 18 per cent. Eating out in five-star restaurants has also got cheaper as some outlets were paying almost 20 per cent tax due to different state taxes while now it has been fixed at 18 per cent. There were jokes in social media like ‘do guna lagaan’ due to SGST and CGST but this is not a case of a consumer being taxed twice but only a break-up of GST into 9 per cent each for the Centre and state.Nidhi Verma of Leela Ambience Gurugram said there used to be a notion that dining at five-star hotels was an expensive affair as compared to standalone restaurants. But introduction of GST, according to her means, paying the same for eating at outlets in a hotel or outside. “Most five-star outlets do not levy service charge. So, with the introduction of GST, even though marginally less, it will still be more economical to actually eat at a five-star diner,” she explained.For those fretting about their luxury holidays, having to wait due to a higher tax of 28 per cent on room rents above Rs 7,500, Nidhi said the way to beat that was to book a standard room that costs less and pay for dining and spa services separately – all at 18 per cent — rather than opting for an all-inclusive package that would push the cost up since it will attract a tax of 28 per cent.Restaurants are, however, still trying to figure out the impact on their business. Some were unsure of the level of ‘set off’ or reimbursements they received earlier on service tax. Others were working out a change in their procurement prices as certain items had lesser taxes while others have been placed in a higher bracket. “We will be able to decide what benefits to be passed to consumers after a month of assessment as the change looks nominal or none,” said one restaurateur on condition of anonymity.NRAI though is hopeful of a further reduction in taxes on eating out. “We would have ideally liked to be in a lower tax slab. We hope the government takes industry inputs and reduces taxes and regulations on our industry.

All this despite the fact that Indian economy is growing at a rapid pace, demonetisation has accelerated CASA deposits and reduced the cost of funds, global economy is growing faster, and global financial system hitherto has no alarm signals, inflation is under control, back home there is stable political government, currency is steady and foreign debt investors have shown no panic. Still, we have an unprecedented banking crisis.The government and the regulator can take full credit for the current state of affairs. I make a distinction between PSU and nationalised banks. SBI and IDBI Bank are PSUs, but not nationalised banks. IDBI Bank can be divested without parliamentary approval and SBI is relatively safe. While I discuss issues of PSU banks in general, the existential threat is with the nationalized banks.There are 19 nationalised banks, of which 11 are already under Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) and a newspaper report indicated that five more may soon get the similar status. The banks under PCA have several restrictions limiting their ability to lend, expand or incur major capital expenditure.The government strategically made a bold move to infuse an unprecedented Rs 2.11 lakh crore to revive PSU banks. The strategy has not worked, and it calls for a prompt corrective action (pun intended). The proposed capital infusion was not backed up by governance reforms but got followed by an unexpected scam, denting the credibility of the banking system like never before. Mishandling of a $2 billion scam can snowball a $2-trillion economy into a crisis.A fraud is a fraud and can happen in any system and in any country. We should learn from USA and Israel on how to deal with fugitive criminals, by less noise and more action. The blame game or politicising the issue helps nobody.What is sadly missing is lack of alignment of objectives and actions by the government and the central bank. If one wants to rehabilitate a person addicted to drugs or alcohol, one takes a gentle approach to taper off the addiction and not a harsh do-it-now approach.Nobody can gain say that early recognition of losses is prudent. But it results in capital erosion and must be in tandem with the key shareholder namely the government’s ability to provide the capital. The regulatory forbearance must be reduced judiciously and withdrawn only at an appropriate time.The idea is to ease extraordinary pain of banks — which in fact is a legacy beyond control of the current management — and help them do business as usual to generate surplus so badly needed. RBI instituted asset quality review (AQR) of banks in 2015, comprehensive assessment of bank balance sheets, which resulted in banks reporting sharp increase in GNPLs from 4.3% in FY15 to 9.3% in FY17 and further to 10.4% in 1HFY18.A bank chairman on anonymity, gave me illustration of steel industry. Last two years have been golden years for the steel industry. Many units that became NPA due to AQR were not eligible for fresh loan or working capital credit. They missed the chance for revival, and their lenders, the opportunity to reduce NPAs.Now, there is a February 12 circular, withdrawing all the forbearances that were extended to banks for loan workouts effective March 1, 2018. This has sent panic waves across the banks as it could make things look much worse in their March 2018 balance sheet.In earlier days, PSU banks have been the government’s money machines to print notes to fetch votes through social welfare and anti-poverty schemes (I’m not against such schemes, but they ought to be funded fiscally by the budget) or fill coffers of corrupt politicians.There has been a huge reluctance to let go of this money machine, which is outside budgetary or parliamentary controls. The present government has stopped the use of machine for the corrupt, but the temptation to use it for votes remains.Although private and public banks have similar obligations, we see state-owned banks make dominant contribution to loss-making Jan Dhan accounts, micro insurance and loans under MUDRA scheme and set up branches in remote areas.The nationalised banks have problems on the balance sheet with impaired assets exceeding 20% of loan book i.e. almost 5 times their current net worth. These banks’ real valuable assets outside the balance sheet, in the form of huge franchise with 40% CASA deposits, branch network, millions of loyal and good customers.The franchise and intangible assets can be monetised only by privatisation. The franchise is fast eroding and depleting in value.The current net worth of nationalised banks is Rs 3.6 lakh crores and market capitalisation is less than half of it. In the past five years, the government has infused over Rs 3 lakh crore and will need an estimated Rs 3.4 lakh crore more by March 2019 to meet Basel-III norms. There is no hope of raising capital from the market in the foreseeable future.RBI restrictions and capital constraints are causing these banks to lose market share and particularly good customers. Credit ratings will keep moving downward, driving cost of fund upward.In the current situation, only resolute bold measures taken quickly can save these nationalised banks from extinction. It is unorthodox to take up such sensitive reforms in an election year. But it could prove to be game changer, like unprecedented and unorthodox reforms in the form of demonetisation and GST.What better time than present when the public angst is against use of tax payers’ money to fill the bottomless black hole in PSU banks. Employees can be taken care of with attractive ESOPs. If the government can amend the Act to dilute below 51%, much before actual dilution, valuations will move from abysmal 0.5x book value (BV) to at least 1x BV. The well-run private banks command 3x BV.It can save huge money required to keep banks capital above water but fetch a huge proceed by divestment. Such massive funds available for infrastructure and agriculture will boost growth and new jobs.Plan B, in case privatisation is not feasible politically, should be to restore investor confidence by making appointment of CEOs, board members free of government interference. Cease to use banks for political or social purpose. Give a roadmap to repeal the Nationalisation Act and converting banks to companies.Avoid making the Banks Board Bureau a farce with similar pool of candidates, similar looking interview panel and ministry’s control. If there is will, there will always be a way.(The author is chairman, IIFL Group)",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/can-we-save-nationalised-banks-from-extinction/articleshow/63224369.cms
"Deepak Parekh, Nandan Nilekani back IIM graduate's idea for startups",[],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-49616776,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-204810,overlay-etrise/photo.jpg",2015-11-01T14:13:00,"NEW DELHI: Top business leaders including Deepak Parekh and Nandan Nilekani have come together to back an innovative concept of an IIM graduate penning down 21 innovative ideas in form short stories all of which can be start-up business opportunities.The ideas include motorcycle taxis, terrace farms, asset sweating, pisciculture, state-to-state tourism promotion, rural medics and fashion sourcing.In a first-of-its-kind effort, management consultant and IIM-Ahmedabad alumnus Ravi Nawal has thrown forward these ideas, which he says can address many significant socio-economic challenges before India, in his first book 'India Can'.Published by Bloomsbury, the book contains 21 short stories.Nawal said he is reaching out to corporate houses and government departments, both at Centre and state levels, to take forward the ideas emanating from each of his 21 stories and has already got positive feedback from many.Accolades are coming from many quarters, including top banker and eminent industry leader Deepak Parekh, Infosys co-founder and former UIDAI Chairman Nandan Nilekani and Dipak C Jain, former Dean -- Kellogg School of Management and INSEAD.Parekh said the book is ""truly inspiring for it offers simple, innovative ideas that may well be transformational for India.""""Through 21 short stories, the book captures relatable, everyday life experiences of the common man. Each character displays a spirit of true entrepreneurship , reflecting the determination to bring a positive change in India,"" he said.Parekh, Chairman of the housing finance major HDFC, said that Nawal has marked his debut as one of India's most promising and thought-provoking new-age authors and 'India Can' is must-read for anyone who believes in India's future.Nilekani said, ""It is now apparent that the rapidly rising aspirations of India's billion plus population cannot be met by 'business as usual' methods.""It will require highly innovative ideas that reimagine the way we do things. Ravi has captured several of the possible ideas in his book and they should be debated and implemented where possible,"" he added.Jain, who is currently Director at Sasin Graduate Institute of Business Administration, said innovation is the engine of growth and development.""As a collection of short stories accessible to everyone, 'India Can' is a truly innovative way to address important challenges facing India. I certainly hope that it achieves what we should all strive for: success with significance,"" he added.The author, who believes that the written word can be a powerful instrument for creating impact, said he does not believe in ""pedantic academic discussions on problems and text bookish solutions to these problems"".""I did not want to write a heavy-duty or high-brow book as I wanted it to be meant for the masses"".One of his stories focusses on public transportation wherein he has advanced the idea of motorcycle taxis as most solutions currently in vogue are urban centric and very few focus on last mile connectivity.""Motorcycle taxis could be a possible solution to public transportation in the rural hinterlands, where lack of adequate road infrastructure and economics do not make a case for investments in public transportation.""Such a taxi service can also be leveraged as part of the multi-modal transportation solution for urban centres to provide effective last mile connectivity,"" he said.The idea of motorcycle taxis is advanced through the story of a single mother in rural suburbs of Delhi, challenged with her daily commute to and from work. The protagonist comes up with the solution based on her evaluation of what will work best for a person of her socio-economic milieu.Another story talks about a concept of 'asset sweating'.Most public infrastructure in India, such as schools, colleges, office buildings are open during the day hours, typically between 9 AM to 6 PM. For the rest of the evening and night, these assets lay idle.At the same time, there is a strata of Indian society that is unable to undertake entrepreneurial activity for want of suitable operating space.This concept has been forwarded through the story of a migrant worker who wishes to augment his family income but struggles for want of space to operate from.The story suggests opening of public infrastructure to entrepreneurs for work and development activities such as needle classes, adult literacy coaching, clinics, alcoholic anonymous support group meetings and women cooperatives.Another story talks about a partnership agreement between Jammu and Kashmir and Telangana to run dedicated tourist trains, resulting in huge fillip to state economies through increased domestic tourism.While tourism is a big industry in India, very few from the low income groups are taking to the road except for travelling to religious places and to meet relatives.The state governments, working hard to attract tourists and revving up their state economies, can play an important role in facilitating travel into their states, Nawal says.A big expense head in travel is transportation itself, followed by lodging costs. State governments can undertake agreements and run dedicated trains with heavily subsidised tickets for people from the other state to visit them. This will also provide fillip to bed-and-breakfast and entertainment options for all strata of the society.Such state sponsored tourism will also serve the larger goal of national integration, the story suggests.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/Deepak-Parekh-Nandan-Nilekani-back-IIM-graduates-idea-for-startups/articleshow/49616755.cms
"Government may find ethanol fix for liquor, oil companies","['Rajeev Jayaswal', 'Madhvi Sally']","https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-45265135,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-86447,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2014-11-25T04:00:00,"NEW DELHI: The battle for alcohol between the liquor industry and oil companies is likely to end. The government plans to allow petrol blending with ethanol produced from non-edible plants.Currently, ethanol produced from sugarcane is the only source for blending, which makes it scarce for alcohol and chemicals manufacturing. The oil ministry has recently moved a proposal for the Cabinet to allow blending petrol with cellulosic ethanol produced from biomass such as switchgrass, paper pulp, sawdust, municipal waste and non-edible parts of plants.This would be an alternative to ethanol made from molasses, a byproduct of sugar manufacturing, government officials said. This would help in reducing India’s dependence on energy imports, keep cities and villages clean and avoid confrontations with liquor and chemical industry, executives in oil companies said. The government had launched sale of ethanol blended petrol in 2003 and gradually made 5% blending mandatory in 20 states and four Union Territories, subject to availability of the biofuel.But, domestic produces could only meet less than one-third of the 115 crore litres ethanol demand in 2013-14 to meet 5% blending target at reasonable cost. Import of the produce did not make commercial sense because cost of ethanol would have doubled, officials said. The liquor manufacturers said there is an ethanol demand and supply mismatch.“The supplies are just sufficient for alcohol and chemical industry,” said Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies director general Pramod Krishna. Liquor industry executives said the fight for ethanol was pushing up its price and the biggest gainer is the sugar lobby. “Price of ethanol with 94% alcohol has seen a rise of 20% to Rs 41-42 a litre since the past few months. Sugar industry says they are passing the benefit to farmer which we don’t think is happening,” an executive said requesting anonymity.The sugar industry has been asking government to increase ethanol blending from 5 to 10%, food ministry officials said. “The industry is not even able to blend 5% ethanol. Let them reach here and then we will see,” a food ministry official said. Indian Sugar Mills Association spokesperson said potable liquor is the main contributor to any state exchequer, hence the supplies of alcohol is assured to the potable liquor industry.“We are not aware of any development whether the government is planning to allow manufacturing of ethanol from any source other than sugarcane. At present, the demand of all the three sectors is comfortably met from indigenous alcohol/ethanol. The domestic ethanol manufacturers are capable to meet the demand of ethanol by the OMCs for 5% blending with petrol at which the total requirement would be approximately 105 crore litres,” the spokesperson said.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/Government-may-find-ethanol-fix-for-liquor-oil-companies/articleshow/45265135.cms

Gujarat government plans to relax liquor norms in GIFT city,['Dp Bhattacharya'],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-47932111,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-368354,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2015-07-04T10:27:00,"GANDHINAGAR: Lack of spirits won't become a damper for doing business in the mega financial centre Gujarat is building.The state is expected to dilute its decades-long prohibition rule for the Gujarat International Finance and Tec-City (GIFT), in its quest to make the enclave a worthy competitor to the big regional financial centres in Dubai and Singapore . Leaving alcohol out can become costly in this effort, as often business talks and deals happen around drinks.Since the GIFT enclave will be treated as a ""deemed foreign territory"", prohibition regulations will be much more liberal, GIFT City Managing Director and Group Chief Executive Ramakant Jha said. The state already issues liquor permits over the Internet to visitors to the state and ""once the hotels and clubs come up in the area, the visitors can obtain their permits over the counter"", he said.There is no specific provision to serve alcohol in the area at present, said another key functionary on the condition of anonymity. But, ""keeping the international character of the place in mind, such arrangements will have to be made as a large number of international visitors are coming here,"" this person said.The problem now is lack of infrastructure. The GIFT City has started functioning with some institutions already moving in, but recreational facilities aren't in place. An under-construction club house will take a year to become fully functional, said a source.Until then, visitors will have to manage with the existing liquor permit system, which itself has become considerably easier over the years.The Gujarat government , first under Narendra Modi when he was chief minister and now Anandiben Patel, has gone all out to make the state attractive for businessmen to visit and invest in.The e-permit system, implemented ahead of this year's Vibrant Gujarat Summit, authorises managers of the hotels permitted to sell liquor to verify documents and operationalise permits issued over the Internet. There are 35 such hotels in Gujarat, with nine in Ahmedabad and one in Gandhinagar. The permit will be granted for a week. It can be extended, by a week at a time, for up to a month. The government also issues spot liquor permits to visitors at Ahmedabad International Airport.Still, businessmen say prohibition has become a major hurdle in attracting investment. ""We are losing out on tourism as well as bright human resources due to prohibition as consumption of alcohol is a way of life in the rest of the world, and the non-availability of it here does impact business in a negative way,"" Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Rohit Patel said. These impediments will have to be taken care of for the success of a big business enclave such as the GIFT City, he added.The state government had made a policy decision in 2007 allowing sale of liquor within special economic zones, but it has never been implemented.The GIFT City is India's first multi-service SEZ with International Financial Service Centre (IFSC) status, aimed at catering to India's large financial services potential by offering global firms world-class infrastructure and facilities. It has already attracted several international banks.The project was conceived in 2007, when Modi was the chief minister. Construction began in 2011 and it got the SEZ and IFSC status in the same year. Things started moving faster after Modi became the prime minister last year.""For years we have been trying to get all the clearances from Delhi, but during last one year, thanks to the Union government , we have got all the necessary clearances from Sebi and RBI and the rules also have been framed,"" said Gujarat Finance Minister Saurabh Patel . The central government is looking at offering taxation benefits to the area, he said.Meanwhile, a source in the GIFT City said the IFSC has yet to become as competitive as Dubai or Singapore. While the Reserve Bank of India earlier this year relaxed rules and reserve requirements for banks to start branches in the enclave, the source said the regulations are still not as good as in abroad. ""We are asking for some more relaxations and incentives to make this competitive internationally,"" he said.In the enclave, construction is over for two towers of 29 floors. While a school has come up, work is ongoing for a data centre.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/Gujarat-government-plans-to-relax-liquor-norms-in-GIFT-city/articleshow/47931970.cms
New AIADMK to be a family without VK Sasikala and TTV Dhinakaran,['V Prem Shanker'],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-58255210,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-276247,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2017-04-19T11:26:00,"CHENNAI: The two warring factions of the AIADMK showed signs of coming together by sidelining imprisoned party general secretary VK Sasikala and her nephew TTV Dhinakaran on Tuesday evening. Tamil Nadu 's ruling party had been beset with uncertainty as an impression gained ground that it is no longer in control of the state's politics and policy even as unrest roils large sections of the population that have taken to the streets giving rise to a veritable summer of discontent in the state.There was a temporary relief for AIADMK (Amma) deputy general secretary TTV Dhinakaran on Tuesday as a Delhi Police team which was to visit Chennai to serve a summons on Dhinakaran had put off its trip.The Delhi police is inquiring a case in which Dhinakaran allegedly tried to bribe a middleman to win back the `Two Leaves' symbol for his party. Meanwhile, late on Tuesday evening, state finance minister D Jayakumar, who had been batting for Dhinakaran thus far, said, “We are going to sideline the Dhinakaran family for the benefit of the party,“ signalling that the rival factions sans Sasikala and her family which led the ruling AIADMK (Puratchi Thalaivi Amma) party were willing to bury their differences with O Panneerselvam who had told reporters in Theni earlier that there was no way he was going to back on his main demand that the party should not be under the control of one family.“The two towering personalities of state politics (J Jayalalithaa and an ailing DMK president M Karunanidhi ) are not in the scene. The present state government does not have any direction. That is why all these things are happening,“ says BJP national secretary H Raja.Chief minister Edappadi K Palanisamy has been mired in a host of political issues that face the ruling AIADMK (Amma). This includes opposition from a breakaway faction led by former chief minister O Panneerselvam, the fallout from the recently countermanded R K Nagar bypoll in which his political boss Dhinakaran was due to contest.The CM did not respond to a detailed questionnaire from ET on the developments.Senior bureaucrats and experts agree the cloud of political uncertainty and an undercurrent of civil unrest are indeed taking a toll on Tamil Nadu's ability to focus on policies.The state is entering a dangerous gridlock where crucial decision-making is being left to “core bureaucracy“ which keeps “the day-to-day functioning going.“ However, the danger is in resolving long-term issues and the time being set aside for it, say experts. Stirring the muddied waters is the growing discontent on the ground.Elections to local bodies are yet to take place and all panchayat and local body posts are lying vacant. The state administration is also facing widespread protests over drought relief for farmers, the intrusiveness of state alcohol retailing outlet Tasmac into residential areas and `police brutality' against protesters.While efforts are on to nip protests before they take Jallikattu-like proportions, the chances of a relapse are high according to social activists who follow developments on the ground.“The state government's inability to take decisions has left a gaping hole of about 40-60% vacancies in all government departments, be it agriculture, rural development or any other sector,“ said Paadam Narayanan, director of Change India, who is of the view that “even if district administrations give an order, there is no one to carry it out.““The last-mile connectivity to people has been cut off completely. This is one reason for the strong undercurrent of protest simmering across the state,“ he said.State bureaucrats aver that it is not just the lack of charismatic leaders in the state but the role of the Centre too that has caused the current flux.“There is a lack of clarity about leadership in the state. Nobody knows if someone in the state is in control of the government currently or if someone else is controlling it from outside,“ said former revenue secretary S Narayan.State's senior bureaucrats talking to ET on condition of anonymity say that while on one side the state is unable to reason with the Centre on various issues, the BJP-led Centre has taken an “unusually hardened“ approach towards the state of late.At the centre of the ire are policies such as the National Eligibility-CumEntrance Test (NEET) where TN would like more time for its implementation, Goods and Services Tax where the state's position is to get more clarity on the `fitment of products manufactured in the Tamil Nadu' to the right taxation slabs and the recent regional connectivity scheme where Tamil Nadu has had its share of concerns about the disparity in its tax relief given to air travel under the scheme when compared to the road transport supported by the state; but has had to fall in line eventually.“The Centre talks of cooperative federalism but what it actually means is `we will tell you what to do and you should do it'. They (the Centre) expect the state to cooperate with what they are saying. They are not ready to listen to our issues,“ said a senior bureaucrat.There are others who feel that the state has not done its due diligence before pointing fingers. K Pandiarajan, a key member of the breakaway faction of the AIADMK, points out “Tamil Nadu has had its fair share of hearing in the various GST council meetings,“ as a coalition had been formed by bringing states with similar interests together and pushing ideas through.“But after I had to step down (as Tamil Nadu's representative for the GST council), the state finance minister D Jayakumar had missed two crucial sessions of the meet and it has cost us a lot,“ he said.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/new-aiadmk-to-be-a-family-without-vk-sasikala-and-ttv-dhinakaran/articleshow/58254949.cms

The cards game, once a man's domain -over cigars and single malts -has caught the fancy of the ladies.Well-known fashion choreographer Sheetal Sharma is one of the dames in the game. She plays poker two to three times a month. “I have seen women wearing nail paint to kaftans depicting poker chips. That is the level of poker rage now. It is an engaging mind game which involves much math and technique,“ says Sharma, who notes how women have graduated from teen patti, bridge and rum my to poker.Restaurateur Shweta Gupta dedicatedly plays poker once every ten days.Like a night show of a film, her quorum schedules poker nights on a week day from 8.30 pm to 11.30 pm. “Poker gives a high. Your observation skills improve as you study people who could be bluffing,“ says Gupta. This new item on the social calendar is more about the game than food.“Food is curated around the game.We serve finger food, rolls or khowsuey in comfortable bowls with red wine. Sometimes, we play after dinner over salads, snacks or desserts,“ adds Gupta.While many play privately at each other's homes on an informal note, a rare few play at professional tables.Like Pavana Kishore, the only lady poker player from Bengaluru who has won national poker tournaments. A veteran high-stakes player in the poker circuit, Kishore plays twice a week with men and women.“Men try to intimidate the only lady on the table. But I stay focused on the cards, study their faces and anticipate their next move,“ says Kishore, who has played at poker tables in Macau, London and Colombo.“Online poker is the next big thing. It is emerging popular especially amongst women who can pick up the game under convenient anonymity ,“ observes Kishore, who also took the same route.Kishore is one of the few who has a liberal family which is “mature enough to understand that poker is a skill game and not just about gambling.“Psychologist Shamsah Pradhan finds poker to be actually beneficial if caution is exercised. “Poker offers a good balance. It exercises your mind over a lighthearted evening by socialising in a safe environment.One can go overboard on alcohol intake at a night club. Book reading can get serious. Scheduled poker nights ensure compulsory socialising for women who neglect it due to family commitments. Poker is great as long as it is treated only as a stress-buster,“ ends Pradhan.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/Poker-becomes-a-favourite-for-Bengaluru-women/articleshow/50011401.cms
Government's ethanol fuel blending plan falls short of target,['Shreya Jai'],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-34084559,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-23903,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2014-04-23T04:00:00,"NEW DELHI: The government’s ambitious plan to blend petrol with 5% ethanol has fallen far short of target, creating problems for sugarmills , which supply the alcohol, and the chemical industry , which is complaining that there is a big shortage in the market.Against the requirement of 105 crore litre of ethanol for mandatory 5% blending with petrol, oil companies have contracted just 62 crore litre, half of which is yet to be lifted from depots.Ethanol Blending Programme (EBP) was launched to promote green fuel and reduce the oil import bill. The sugar industry has estimated that oil companies could have easily saved Rs 370 crore on their oil import bill if they had blended the 62 crore litre supplied by sugarmills in the past year.While oil companies cite ‘procedural delays’ in lifting the ethanol offered by the supplier sugarmills, the latter is unable to regularise its ethanol production and supply due to the same.“When a mill has offered a particular amount to the oil companies for EBP, it cannot contract it anywhere else. So, if the delay is over six months, the quantity promised to oil companies gets stuck,” said Abinash Verma, director general, Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs in November last year mandated 5% ethanol blending in petrol sold after June 30, 2013. It also allowed oil companies to negotiate the price with domestic and overseas suppliers of the bio fuel.A senior official with Indian Oil Corporation said that such a huge amount of ethanol procurement requires time and resources. “It’s just been a year since we issued the first tender for procuring ethanol. Such an ambitious programme needs time more than this,” said the official requesting anonymity.The programme has been marred by legal and pricing hiccups throughout last year. To meet their annual demand, oil companies floated two tenders in January and July last year to procure ethanol from sugarmills last year.While the supply from the first tender was purchased in the price band ofRs 39-42 per litre, oil firms decided in January 2014 that they would procure ethanol from only those bidders who match their benchmark price of Rs 44 per litre. On this basis, they also rejected 36 crore litre of ethanol supply from sugarmills.In the meanwhile, the chemical industry filed three cases in the Competition Commission of India (CCI). Two were quashed while one is with the Supreme Court. In its appeal to the apex court, Indian Glycols has alleged cartelisation by sugarmills and oil companies and also submitted that with limited availability of molasses-based ethanol in the country, any diversion of ethanol e.g., to EBP “shall adversely affect the very existence of the chemical industry in India.”“The EBP has faced hassles from all corners, be it price issue with mills, CCI case filed by chemical industry or just procedural delays due to inter-state policy mismatch,” said an IOCL official.Oil companies are supposed to get excise permission from both the supplier and domestic state, which they assert is a “time-consuming task.”The Indian sugar industry has the capacity to produce 250 crore litre of alcohol annually. Its major buyers are chemical industry, whose demand is 60 crore litre, potable alcohol industry, which sources 110 crore litre, and oil companies need around 100 crore litre annually.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/Governments-ethanol-fuel-blending-plan-falls-short-of-target/articleshow/34084538.cms
"Union Budget 2017: If more money is required, I am willing to give it to banks: Arun Jaitley",[],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-56916629,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-16881,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg",2017-02-01T17:28:00,"In an interview with ET Now said he has provided Rs 10,000 crore for PSU banks in accordance with the Indradhanush Scheme. But he also said that if more money is required, he is willing to give it to banks.Edited excerpts:This year, the personal income growth I mentioned in my speech is something close to 38%. Now people who were transacting in cash and part of their income and expenditure was in cash have been compelled to put that money into the banks. When they put this money into the banks, the money lost anonymity.Arun Jaitley: Now the transactions of money are going to be more cheque centric. So demonetisation to that extent will expand and people are going to disclose more. For instance, yesterday’s declaration by the CBDT that they have in the first analysis identified 18 lakh people whose cash deposits are disproportionate to their income. So obviously a lot of that is going to come as income . I see a lot of gain in personal income tax, companies have to do better in order to pay more corporate tax and, of course, the manufacturing will have to pick up in order to pay more excise.Also, do not forget that excise is going to vanish in the middle of the year into the GST and therefore in the first few months of the GST will be experimental and then, of course when the GST takes over after a couple of months in a big way, then I think the indirect tax collections will expand.That bad bank is very similar to asset reconstruction company except that it is run by the government. Now I am not saying, it is a very good proposal but you have just expanded, allowed FDI, liberalised the whole ARC business and therefore you have a lot of ARCs which have become active. In the last three-four months you have a lot of debtors who are coming up and whose assets are going that way. I think let us experiment this solution. The bad bank suggestion is on the table. The fact that it is not mentioned in my budget speech does not mean it does not make sense to us but it is very much a subject on the agenda.I have provided in accordance with what was said in the Indradhanush Scheme – Rs 25,000 crore there and Rs 10,000 here. But I have also said if more money is required, I am willing to give it out to banks.This has been very effective.That compensation mechanism has been discussed, finalised and put to sleep by the GST Council that has to be funded from within the GST.I will tell you today there are several items on which the centre is levying taxes and those taxes are reasonably high. These are taxes are on luxury vehicles, pan masala, gutka, alcohol, soft drinks -- all these are health related and luxury or sin products as we broadly call them. They have tax rate up to 65%. The maximum rate of tax on GST is 28%. So that surplus over and above 28% for the first five years will become the compensation cess.The 28% will go into the divisible pool and the one above that will be the compensation fund so which the GST Council will decide.On the disinvestment, the government is divesting more but making less noise. In the government led by Mr Vajpayee in five years, we divested Rs 27000 crore and there was a song and dance everyday about divestment. This year, I do that kind of amount every year for instance this year as I speak to you today I have already divested 31000 this year, I am going to touch Rs 45000 crore.I am going to touch Rs 41000 crore next year besides the normal divestment do not forget I would have listed all the insurance companies, the GIC companies and under the SEBI regulation I have to bring down the government holding to 74%.So under SEBI a government on a listed company cannot hold more than 74% so when 100 becomes 74 and look at the kind of values that is going to generate for us.No, Rs 71000-72000 crore but there is now a legal requirement for me to divest part of those five companies next year.Foreign direct investment has become easier at the entry point. 90% of FDI today is automatic route and so FIPB is not required. FIPB is required in 10% cases.That is what liberalisation is all about that is…",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/if-more-money-is-required-i-am-willing-to-give-it-to-banks-arun-jaitley/articleshow/56916548.cms

Or for that matter, its various high-speed variants that urge us to exist in the here and now, the passing present, that urgent, ephemeral and apparently most-important ‘moment’ ? Stuff like “For the past is but a shadow and the future an unknown; therefore, voyager revel in the instant you transit through for ’tis the only thing you know” . (Yes, it’s made up, but you get the drift.)The Bible says give us this day our daily bread — and not, for instance, our week’s supply. Buddhists tell us to take one breath at a time. The Gita’s advice is to concentrate on present action.Alcoholics Anonymous, whose rules are similar — namely, to lay off the liquor only on a day-to-day basis — is at least understandable . Psychologists know there’s a neat therapeutic trick of reinforcement involved by means of which a person can reward himself with one brownie point on completion of each 24-hour period that passes without downing a drink.Yet, when that same rule gets applied to everyone across all levels of living, it hardly makes sense. If all of us did that — which naturally would be the goal of such an exhortation — and took it literally, then we’d end up in monasteries, mountain-tops or in our own reclusive and absolute worlds.There’s nothing intrinsically wrong in that, but if taken to its logical extreme, it would be like how most animals live: not for the day, not for the minute, not even for the moment because their lives are a mindless and biotic persistence that keeps traversing through infinitely thin slices of time till that fleeting instant also passes through them and they die.So, if living one day at a time means don’t think about tomorrow or the next day and just live the now, it’s a no-brainer . Because unlike animals, we have an awareness that allows us to learn from past mistakes and anticipate possible futures and, therefore , why should we unnecessarily and suddenly renounce this added feature of our brains?Also, what if all the enlightened people in our history had thought they should be living in the moment and not tomorrow, not next year; that they should be enjoying life today? If they had simply allowed their wisdom to lie fallow while wallowing in its bliss by themselves, would we have had some of our greatest religions today? No. It goes without saying they definitely lived for another day.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/vedanta/Living-to-see-another-day/articleshow/6203513.cms
Tamil Nadu's 'corrupt' cash cow TASMAC: How politics & liquor came to form a potent mix in the state,[],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-45837484,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-10549,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2015-01-11T10:20:00,"Why TASMAC and its inner workings have never really been exposed is possibly due to the unsaid code among politicians — live and let live. Both DMK and AIADMK leaders have close associates running distilleries and breweries. During a DMK regime, the DMK’s associates are favoured but the AIADMK associates are not completely wiped out — vice versa in the AIADMK regime.This is a high-stakes money game with political considerations thrown in. By cartelising the liquor manufacturing business, politicians on both sides of the political spectrum have ensured that the corruption continues unabated and even when not in power, the rival’s associates continue to make money. (See Political Connection...)Tamil Nadu is one of the few states that loves brandy and McDowell’s, a brand owned by USL. McDowell’s is a telling example of how even the fate of popular brands can be decided by the all-powerful TASMAC.The brand’s stock position as on November 6, 2014, (available on the TASMAC website) shows that Mc-Dowell’s is stocked in very small numbers compared with other brands. Lesser known, even barely-known brands are well stocked across the 41 depots of TASMAC.“The reason is not that the brand is unpopular,” says a senior TASMAC official who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Brands are imposed upon retailers. Pay money to officials and even if your brand has no takers, TASMAC will ensure that your stock moves,” he says. On being asked how, the official explains.“Corruption of course,” he says. “It starts at the purchasing level and trickles down. The structure is like this. There is a Purchasing Committee within TASMAC that places the orders and deals with liquor manufacturers. The liquor goes from the liquor manufacturer to 41 depots across the state.The number of cases (48 bottles is one case) depends on the demand reflected by the retail outlets which place their orders with the depots. Retailers have to take stock and ask for fast-selling brands once a week. From these depots, liquor is sent to retail outlets,” he said.“If a company tells TASMAC officials that they will pay anything between Rs 25 and Rs 50 per case, a deal is struck,” continued the official. “Once orders are placed, the liquor goes from that company to the depots. The depot is supposed to send the brands and numbers that the retailers ask for. But because this company has paid bribes, the liquor produced by this firm is forced on retailers,” he explains.Retailers agree. “We are the ones who know the exact demand in the market and we ask TASMAC for the brands that are fast selling,” agrees Saravanan, a retail outlet supervisor and treasurer of a CITU-affiliated TASMAC union.“But TASMAC doesn’t give us the brands our customers ask for. Instead, we are forced to buy some vague brand or a slow-moving brand. The depot staff tells us this is all we have and the popular brand has not come in. In this manner, popular brands are killed. What will the consumer do? Obviously he will buy whatever he gets and complain for a bit before moving on,” he says.At the depots, there is more to this tale of corruption. “We are told beforehand which brands to delay,” said a depot staffer who did not wish to reveal his name. “The officials who issue the orders would inform that particular company beforehand that there will be a purchase order for a specified amount and to keep the stock ready. The company will keep it ready and dispatch it to the depots as soon as they get the order. The popular brand though will get the order only closer to the weekend without prior notice and they will take about a week to get their stock ready and send it to the depots. But since we, the depot staff, are informed in advance, we will delay unloading the stock. This means that the popular brand will be dispatched to retailers only about 10 days from the day they received the indent,” he adds. Meanwhile the not-so-popular company’s stock has reached the shelves and customers are buying it since their preferred popular brand is not available.“Purchases in TASMAC are not made on the basis of demand but on the basis of corruption,” says Thiruchelvam, CITU union leader in TASMAC. “Lower range items are not purchased, only higher range items are purchased because a 375-ml or 750-ml bottle is more profitable for the manufacturer. So he strikes a deal and ensures that only the larger bottles reach the shelves while the quarter bottles do not come. As a result the consumer is forced to buy more alcohol than he desires,” he says.Thiruchelvam adds that even premium segment brands, which are usually bought only by the upper middle class, are also pushed aggressively in this manner. “If you look at any TASMAC retail outlet today, you will find boxes stacked up to the ceiling,” says Saravanan. “These are the little known brands that are thrust upon us, which don’t sell. The retail shop owners are the losers in this whole game,” he adds.Since the Purchasing Committee depends on data available at the depots rather than the shops, depots thrust little known brands on the retail outlets and thereby the actual demand from the customer is not recorded. The Purchasing Committee has powers to issue up to 50% more orders to buy a particular brand based on a calculation using depot sales as the base figure.Since depot sales figures do not reflect the actual demand, the customer does not get his choice and specific brands can be pushed into retail outlets. “If a company wants to introduce a new brand into the market, the bribe goes up to Rs 60 lakh,” says an industry insider who makes IMFL in Tamil Nadu.Bars attached to TASMAC retail outlets too are in demand and it is usually people attached to political parties who get licences to run the 800-odd bars in the state. “To get a licence for a bar, one has to shell out between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 8 lakh as bribe to politicians,” rues a TASMAC employee who runs a bar in Chennai.TASMAC shops themselves are categorized into A, B, C and D, with the A category clocking the highest sales of over Rs 25 lakh a month. Even shop supervisors who look to secure a transfer to the A category shops have to cough up Rs 1 lakh. Otherwise, their request will simply sit on the table of officials concerned.This corruption then trickles to the stores, where the consumer is charged extra for every bottle by the store supervisor, despite TASMAC hiking rates in November, the second increase in two months. “We end up being forced to buy all these brands that simply don’t move, so how do we make our money back?” asked a retail store supervisor on condition of anonymity.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/Tamil-Nadus-corrupt-cash-cow-TASMAC-How-politics-liquor-came-to-form-a-potent-mix-in-the-state/articleshow/45837423.cms

Muzaffarnagar clashes sour its famed jaggery business,['Shreya Jai'],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-22733130,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-38079,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg",2013-09-19T04:59:00,"NEW DELHI: Communal violence in Muzaffarnagar has soured the mood of sugarcane farmers on the eve of the crushing season. The flourishing business of jaggery (gurh) in the region, which calls itself India’s sugar bowl, is already on the verge of a shutdown as workers have fled after the clashes.Muzaffarnagar is home to India’s biggest jaggery market. It accounts for an estimated 20% of India’s output of the rustic sweetener, regarded auspicious by many. Some traders in the area said that the rift between the two communities especially in Shamli region adjacent Muzaffarnagar continues to rattle people, encouraging labourers, mostly Muslims, to flee. “We don’t know how things would shape now. There is a big question of trust and safety lurking over us and the gur unit operators,” said Arun Khandelwal, president of the Gurh Traders Association The region has 11 sugar mills and about 4,000 small units that produce jaggery in a process that actively involves both communities. “Around 85% of the labour involved in the production of gurh, running of the factory and even transportation are Muslims. They have refused to work under Hindu factory owners.The Gurh processing units owned by Muslims are shut because they are not ready to do trade with Hindu traders,” said one of the biggest Gur traders in the Muzaffarnagar mandi.Currently, 80,000 tonne of gurh is lying idle, waiting to be sold, said a trader. “This year, we will see a carry over stock of around 80,000 tonne in the upcoming season starting from October,” said Arun Khandelwal, president, Gur Traders Association. Khandelwal said that most producers have shifted their base to Pune, which an emerging hub for the sweetener. Apart from UP, major processing units are based in Madhya Pradesh and Chhatisgarh.“Most of our business was already shifting to these areas because there are no sugar mills to compete for cane availability there. Now, with the district under threat, labours are contemplating to move to these states,” said a trader, “a major labour crunch is looming over the gurh units here.”Two of the biggest gurh traders also fear the quality of gurh produced going down. “The Muslim labour are the major force behind the gurh production and our quality stands out. Labour force, both Muslim and lower caste Hindus, especially from Shamli are now difficult to trace and convince to work for the units,” said a trader requesting anonymity.Gur cottage industry in the district has been in a soup for long. In the past three years, high cane price and competition from other states led to the Muzaffarnagar market face a loss of Rs 400 per quintal per day. The current price of gur is Rs 1,150 per 40 kg. “Earlier around 1 lakh bags of 40 kg each would come for trading weekly. It has dropped to 80,000 bags per week and we fear that it might go down even more post the riots,” said Khandelwal. October to May is the gur production season and India produces 90 lakh tonne of gur every year. Out of this the share of UP is 55 lakh tonne, to which Muzaffarnagar contributes 20 lakh tonne of gur.About 35% of the cane harvest is used by jaggery units.

Batra was earlier also the general secretary of an organization called Vidya Bharati, the school network run by RSS.From his point of view, Batra’s recent ‘achievements’ have been quite formidable. In 2006 he filed a PIL against NCERT for misrepresenting history. In 2007 he carried out a campaign against sex education in schools, and the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh removed this subject from the school syllabus. In 2008 he petitioned the Delhi High Court to remove A K Ramanujan’s insightful essay ’300 Ramayanas’ from Delhi University’s history syllabus.In 2010 he sent a legal notice to Penguin Books to withdraw Wendy Doniger’s book, ‘Hinduism: An Alternative History’ and Penguin capitulated by 2014. That same year another publisher, Orient Blackswan, shelved the book by scholar Megha Kumar titled ‘Communalism and Sexual Violence: Ahmedabad since 1969', after receiving a legal notice from him. Soon thereafter he sent a legal notice to the magazine Frontline against a cover story entitled ‘Shortcut to Hindu Rashtra’. And on June 30, 2014, six text books written by him were made part of the supplementary reading for schools by the government of Gujarat.Given this record, it is important to seriously analyse what the angst and agenda of Dinanath Batra is. Part of the angst is understandably directed against a culturally rootless, overly anglicised elite which has often undeservedly ruled the roost for too long in our country. This upper crust claims to be liberal, and possibly is, but many of its members cannot write the alphabet in Hindi or their mother tongue, cannot count to 100 in anything but English, know more about Shakespeare than Kalidasa, and cannot give a line by line translation even of our national anthem!Several of the rituals which they have adopted are often a plain mimicry of the West, and surprise even westerners themselves. The Delhi correspondent of the Sunday Times of the UK once told me that he found it incomprehensible why schoolchildren in India, a country with such a rich repertoire of folk and children’s literature of its own, should dress up like Noddy — discredited even in the West — in birthday parties in the capital of the nation. When housing colonies in our cities are proudly named Mayfair or Regency Park or Princeton Apartments, what are we projecting?Why do our leaders end their speeches by raising a toast to a visiting dignitary? Indian government norms do not allow for the serving of alcohol on such occasions. A toast with a glass full of apple juice is, to say the least, unnecessary — since the practice is neither ours nor universal. Public rituals should reflect one’s own culture and history. It would be perfectly in order if a formal banquet speech ends with a prayer for the long life and prosperity of the guests.Even in sports, the privileged position of cricket and the corresponding neglect of almost every other sport is directly a product of our colonised past. In fact, there is, as Bimol Akoijam, a scholar from Africa writes, “an uncanny similarity between the consolidation of colonial power and the growth of cricket in South Asia”.These are but random examples. But the truth is that only the culturally rooted, and not anglicised photocopies as many of us are, can be an effective answer to the angst of people like Dinanath Batra for whom Bhartiyata or Indianness is the goal.More than their angst, it is their agenda which is far more insidious and dangerous. This agenda seeks to impose a certain form of Hindu practice as the only valid one, and is militantly hostile to anyone who differs. Hinduism is a dialogic faith, as is amply illustrated in the Vedas and Upanishads. In its lofty metaphysics and outlook it welcomes dissent and nurtures eclectic thought. It has no one Pope, no one church, no one deity and no one prescribed text. It is quintessentially a way of life.The likes of Batra seek to prescriptively constrict this glorious legacy to fit their own preconceived predilections and — by not being firmly questioned either by the judiciary or by pusillanimous publishing houses — have now assumed an intimidating posture.Moreover, in my view, their reductionist zeal to reduce the entire canvas of Indian history to only the undoubtedly great achievements of the Hindu period distorts our plural past by selectively over-romanticising only one part and ignoring the rest, thereby encouraging the communalisation of history.The real danger is that the unwarranted evangelism of such people seems to have the blessings of our current ruling dispensation. Adoption of Batra’s books by the Gujarat government certainly suggests that. God forbid, if a time comes when what we wear, what we read, what we think, how we pray, and how we behave will be ruled by the diktats of the Shiksha Bachao Andolan.(The writer , an author and former diplomat, is currently adviser to the Bihar chief minister.)",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-commentary/Only-the-culturally-rooted-can-effectively-answer-people-like-Dinanath-Batra/articleshow/39806706.cms

Dance bar effect: Will Mumbai's nightlife regain its zing or cause social problems?,['Madhu T'],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-21197279,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-35897,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2013-07-21T07:06:00,"Mumbaikars are getting a ready for a reunion. The SMSes and mails that followed the Supreme Court verdict on Mumbai dance bars were tinged with nostalgia. Those who moved out of the Maximum City are waiting for the final decision on the matter before booking their tickets for a reunion with old pals. Some wives are also curious to take a peek into the much romanticised and equally maligned inner world of these bars.Mumbai’s young, who never got a chance to shower Rs 10 notes on these dancing girl s (immortalised in so many Hindi films), are also curious about the whole thing. Only a few seasoned erstwhile patrons of these joints still living in Mumbai strike a discordant note.“I don’t know how many of these reunion plans would materialise. Do you think any of us really have the time or energy to go for an all-night binge drinking and dancing date,” says a 40-something businessman, who prefers anonymity for obvious reasons.Good Times are Back...He has reasons for his scepticism. It has been almost a decade since RR Patil, Maharashtra home minister, banned these establishments on the grounds of morality. Most regulars are now pushing 40 or 50 and have familial responsibilities. According to our doubting friend, there is no way the old clientele would flock back to these nightspots. Another past frequenter of these places also shares the pessimism: “Eight years is a long time. The city has changed a lot. You don’t have that carefree nightlife in this city anymore.”He also believes that today’s young, career-focussed Mumbaikars are unlikely to frequent these dance bars. Some bar owners also privately share their doubts whether the business would thrive like it did in the ’90s. Their big worry is whether the middle class would be able to afford the fun. Thanks to “moralistic” politicians, prices of liquor have gone up in the past few years and bars are reeling under pressure.However, Varsha Kale, an activist on behalf of dance bar girls, has no such doubts. “I have already got so many calls from girls since the verdict was out,” she says. Many girls, who got married, had gone back to their villages or to Gulf countries, are already planning to come back to Mumbai. “They all say there is no place like Mumbai,” she says.According to her, old dancers will soon get in touch with the owners of the 350 erstwhile dancing bars that are operating as orchestra bars currently. “Even those working in the Gulf are eager to come back as they have so many problems there. They have to wear very short dresses, they have restrictions on movement and money is also not great anymore.”Shashikant Shetty, general secretary, Association of Hotels and Restaurants (AHAR), says that cost won’t be an issue. “People will pay because it is entertainment. I know many teetotallers who went to these places and just had an energy drink that cost Rs 250,” he says. There was also the parallel economy angle to the whole business. Many businessmen, government officials and policemen usually spent their illgotten, unaccounted wealth in these places.“Some government official would make Rs 2,000 and decide to splurge it on dancers. He is happy; his wife is also happy because the money hasn’t come from the bank account,” says an amused Kale....as are the FrownsBut it’s not just about economics. There is also the social angle. Says Harish Shetty, a well-known psychologist and social commentator: “In an angstridden society, everybody is looking for quick highs. Alcohol mixed with commoditised women provides an easy option. They form a strong relationship with this pseudo family and neglect their own family,” he says.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/Dance-bar-effect-Will-Mumbais-nightlife-regain-its-zing-or-cause-social-problems/articleshow/21197222.cms
Food festivals are hot new trend in the metros. But how viable is the business?,[],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-50058197,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-60751,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2015-12-06T03:10:00,"Fashions and people have strange ways of coming back. Bad pennies and lost loves turn up unexpectedly. Your mom’s shararas get back in style as ‘new’ palazzo pants. Actors make comebacks, so do writers. And twins separated in Kumbh Mela reconcile in the same or other fairgrounds.” Except this time, it is the mela itself making a comeback…The great Indian fair may have had its genesis in village grounds with travelling nautanki troupes, one-dish stalls with kulfi, chaat, faux jewellery — or such are the Bollywood-foisted images — and with scary numbers of people. But now the mela is back in circulation in a chicer avatar. “Food festivals”, which really are old-style melas refashioned, are tickling the imaginations and palates of the Indian consumer this winter and seem to have become quite the preferred F&B enterprise too.The refashioned food mela’s epicentre is Delhi-NCR for now. Half a dozen of these festivals here have kept “foodies” busy on almost all weekends since November beginning, with the New Delhi Palate Fest, arguably the most high-profile of these events, bringing up the crescendo last weekend. The tide hasn’t abated.This Sunday, you can still be part of the frenzied action at the Gourmet High Street in Leisure Valley, Gurgaon, where highlights include not just food retail but cooking sessions by celebrity chefs, including Gaggan Anand (who flew in from Bangkok to show audiences how to do his gajar-halwa flowers) . Then, the next weekend, there’s more to gorge on at a street food mela by the National Association of Street Vendors of India at the Jawahar Lal Nehru Stadium.Meanwhile, Mumbai is gearing up for what is being pegged as the city’s first “family food fest”, put together by the “Eat India Company” at the Mahalakshmi Racecourse. If you happen to be in Gurgaon on that same weekend, you could have another go at the Grub Fest which makes a second appearance in as many months. Finally, there is a “food street” curated by a food group, part of a larger Teamwork event, the weekend after. Next year, all the players, and undoubtedly more, are set to take the bandwagon to other cities, tier II ones as well as distant lands.If all this doesn’t leave you exhausted, you may like to reflect and ask: why? Why indeed has the revitalised mela become so popular? And what kind of business really does it make, for both organisers and participants?Like much else in India, including fish caught in Indian waters, exported and then reimported to India at manifold the price, the mela has made a desi comeback after a sojourn abroad. ‘Festivals’, such as the Melbourne Food and Wine or the Taste of London, have been inspirations and templates. Taste of London, this year, for instance, saw 26,000 visitors, 15 of the city’s “best restaurants” with pop-ups and 150 exhibitors over five days in St Regent’s Park. In comparison, the New Delhi Palate Fest, arguably the most successful of these desi events, saw almost 100 big and small food and drink retailers participate. Though this year’s footfalls have not been made available, last year it reported 90,000 visitors across three days.Last year was the first time any such “food festival” in India had attracted such large-scale interest. What Palate did was to crack the market for more such events. Aside from managing to get some of the best known restaurant and food retail brands to set up stalls and ‘pop-ups’— each space was sold for varying sums, up to a couple of lakhs — the trump card undoubtedly was the venue: Nehru Park, bang in the centre of the city.This year, Palate’s venue shifted to a smaller area (the PSOI club, Chanakyapuri). Other “festival” players managed similar outdoor venues, partnering with real estate developers, civic agencies, private retail hubs et al. In our cities starved of outdoor entertainment, clearly these are a big draw. In essence, the model for all these outdoor fests remains the same: Find salubrious space, sell stalls or larger spaces to restaurant and F&B brands, arrange enough other entertainment to keep the crowds engaged. Thanks to social media — and sometimes mass media — partnering many of these activities, aspirational consumer increasingly looking at new food products but also “experiences” walk in.But food aside, like in any old-fashioned mela, entertainment is important too, to all the “food fests”. Palate, for instance, this year, roped in bands like Euphoria, Mrigya, Nasha and Menwhopause. The Grub Fest, put together by four young entrepreneurs with backgrounds in the music and events businesses, actually seems to have initiated this idea of basing the event on food (“because the audience for it can range from 9-90-yearsold, while for a music festival, it will be limited usually to 18-25 years old”, as one of its promoters put it) but building in music and live acts to attract a younger client base with larger disposable incomes and access to social media that helps further “the buzz”.From Vir Das to Raghu Dixit to high wattage bands, the Grub Fest featured quite a line-up, which were as much a draw as the 100 restaurant brands that made this a legit “food” fest. The entertainment on offer may differ. Mumbai’s “family food fest”, for instance, is all set to showcase not just music but mime and juggler acts and activities for children.A top chef in the country, on condition of anonymity, recalls a conversation with a friend, the executive chef of a barely-known hotel. So high was the demand for space at a particular high-profile mela that it had been sold out within just a couple of days. Unable to find a stall, the exececutive chef was ready to pay “any price” just to be there at the mela. Of course, it is important to note that the hotel had (and still does) negligible brand recall. With high footfalls, the melas are obvious go-tos for any restaurant brand wanting to engage in marketing activity. New brands can find exposure, others engage with new customers or test the market for yet-to-belaunched products.MTV Flip, a chain of cafés all set to launch later this month, participated in the Grub Fest in Gurgaon, obviously to gauge its audience. Similarly, Fat Lulu’s Nitin Datwani, who is venturing into a casual Indian brand, wanted to test the market with his new offerings. For food fans these new or undiscovered offerings can be quite exciting. But while most festivals do claim to balance the bigger retailers with “smaller” players in their curation, fact is that most are dominated by the established chains/brands with budgets to spend on marketing.Food-events entrepreneurs Mangal Dalal and Nachiket Shetye, who visited the Capital to check out three of the melas on a single weekend, observe: “We were looking for offbeat offerings but most were wellknown brands.” Even so, to have so many different restaurants retailing out of the same venue is a draw for consumers. Whether these casual walkins will translate into loyal customers for established brands is any one’s guess, but even when bigger brands participate, the hope certainly is enhanced exposure.Restaurateur Riyaaz Amlani believes that the objective of most restaurant brands in participating is “additional visibility and fear of missing out”. The last is an interesting observation because that also is a factor egging on rival groups. Few participants want to speak on record but most admit that sales is not the focus.Food sold at the melas is by no means cheap— I spent three hours during lunchtime at one, spending about `6,000 between three people sans alcohol. It is the same price I would pay at an upscale restaurant for better food quality and restaurant experience. But this does not necessarily mean profit for participating restaurants. The cost of infrastructure, hiring equipment if needed for an outdoor venue, and the cost of the space itself, does not cover costs. If the brand is not popular to start with and gets fewer walk-ins the loss can be manifold.Even for big restaurateuring companies with popular brands, the odds often don’t weigh up. Restaurateur AD Singh points out: “The set up costs for restaurants like us which likes to create an ambience and a wholesome experience doesn’t always justify the sales with rents that are charged at the fests. We feel that a percentage of sales like charged up to 15% is a good model to work with rather than large rentals which don’t guarantee profits or sales.” Singh adds: “Some platforms are ideal for new restaurants and lend them good marketing opportunities”. The catch of course is that many smaller retailers cannot afford to make these marketing spends.Instead, it is hotel-restaurant brands, wanting to fight stiff competition from standalones and in danger of facing irrelevance with the new generation of diners, that often bankroll many of these melas. They often land up paying the highest prices for stalls, unfortunately, often attracting the least footfalls, especially if their products do not resonate with the younger audience that floats into these events. There are exceptions, of course. And a good, unique or contemporary product always has takers but it is hardly a one-fit-all model.For now, food melas are the flavour of the season. So successful have they been for promoters that they are attracting sponsors and even funding offers. Most are set to go to other cities. Palate has already gone to Goa and Chandigarh and plans Mumbai. Grub Fest is set to go to Goa and Bengaluru, and then to Mumbai and London.Amlani, also president of National Restaurant Association of India president, says: “The promoters are doing a great job, it’s a nascent industry and needs to be encouraged. It isn’t easy pulling off these events, since you’re kept on tenterhooks till the last minute by all government authorities in charge of licensing. The only thing I feel promoters need to do is better infrastructure for production areas and planning in such a way that no trace is left behind.”Niggles like power cuts (food got spoilt at one of the fests), delay in getting liquor licences, lack of waste disposal, lack of seating, and clean toilets… aside, what promoters need to focus on is the quality of food/ brands and food-centric entertainment. Some like the Gourmet High Street seem to be doing that— with an attempt to innovate. Instead of just restaurant retail , and music for entertainment, the focus here is on demos by popular chefs, family cookouts, and wine and whisky tastings (you can buy a single glass for about Rs 500 and keep tasting till you have your fill).As the melas grow, the tightrope to walk for promoters though will be between keeping these events creative, and content-focussed and following an out-and-out commercial route that we see happening with some music and even wine festivals in the country.“Curation is a problem”, says Karen Anand, food consultant, who had brought Taste to Mumbai about two years ago and who battles exactly the same dilemma with her organic farmers markets across the country. To be sustainable, the ventures need to make money — from restaurants-with-budgets, sponsors and perhaps ticket sales. But to be interesting, they will need more rigour and imagination.(The writer examines restaurant trends, food history and culinary cultures)",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/food/Food-festivals-are-hot-new-trend-in-the-metros-But-how-viable-is-the-business/articleshow/50058151.cms
Pre-poll revelry may prop up select sectors in the short term,['Vijay Gurav'],https://img.etimg.com/photo/65498029.cms,2009-03-13T00:32:00,"MUMBAI: The spin-off effects of election spending and post-poll revelry could help businesses like liquor, auto and FMCG. Money spent in country-wide campaigns and large cash dealings may lead to a surge in demand, albeit short-lived, in these sectors.Political parties receive donations running into hundreds of crores of rupees from industrialists and builders who may be disclosing a fraction of what they actually dole out. This money moves around the cash economy during the weeks before the polls and also spills over into post-poll spending.As large number of party workers and prospective voters participate in the campaign, cash is spent in a way that keeps the morale high. ���Sale of alcoholic beverages shoots up during elections. With increase in money supply, especially in rural areas, demand for personal care products is also likely to go up,��� said Edelweiss Securities in its report ���India Election Watch���. Auto sales are also expected to improve as there will be more demand for vehicles, particularly special utility vehicles (SUVs), for election campaigns, personal transportation and security of politicians, said the report.Some analysts feel political spending may be subdued this time, given unfavourable market conditions. ���Flow of money in this year���s elections may not be strong because of the sluggish economic scenario and crash in property prices,��� said Ambareesh Baliga, vice-president, Karvy Stock Broking. But he felt demand for two-wheelers, SUVs and FMCG goods will rise ��� the extent of which would depend on the kind of money that various parties are willing to splurge.Since any change in demand outlook for these select sectors would be short term in nature, it would not significantly impact market sentiment. ���Investors would be more concerned about the long-term prospects of the industry as a whole, which is currently reeling under domestic and global economic blues. Any short-term trigger would not help much in regaining investor confidence,��� said an analyst on condition of anonymity.Political parties are currently sorting out differences with their key allies and issues relating to seat sharing in different states. These pre-poll issues have apparently led to concerns in the market over the fate of two leading political groupings ��� the Congress-led UPA and the BJP-led NDA in the elections to be held between April 16 and May 13, 2009.Though Dalal Street players may closely follow the political developments, the market is unlikely to see big swings until the results are announced.

Renuka Sugars to submit final bid for Brazilian co,"['Kausik Datta', 'Dev Chatterjee']",https://img.etimg.com/photo/65498029.cms,2010-02-06T00:50:00,"MUMBAI: India’s biggest sugar refiner Shree Renuka Sugars will put in the final bid for Brazil’s Equipav Acucar E Alcool next week, as it intends to consolidate its presence in the world’s largest producer of the sweetener. Equipav is one of the largest sugar companies in Brazil.“The Equipav promoters have recently announced the criteria for final bidding. In all, five parties have done due diligence on Equipav. All of them are likely to submit final bids by February 12,” said a person close to the development. Other bidders include world heavy-weights in the sugar industry such as Noble of Hong Kong and NYSE-listed Bungee, he said, requesting anonymity. Around mid-2009, the promoters of Equipav invited final bids, but failed to choose the winning bidder due to internal differences.If the deal fructifies, it will mark the biggest overseas purchase by any Indian sugar firm. The promoters of Equipav are quoting an enterprise value, equity plus debt minus cash, of around $1 billion (Rs 4,625 crore).Last November, Shree Renuka bought Brazil’s sugar and ethanol producer Vale Do Ivai Acucar E Alcool for an enterprise value of $240 million (Rs 1,110 crore). Till now, this remains the biggest cross-border acquisition among Indian sugar players.The same person said the equity portion of the deal would be around $400-500 million, while the balance would be debt. Shree Renuka plans to use the money, it had raised last July, through a Rs 500-cr qualified institutional placement to part-finance the acquisition. Shree Renuka managing director Narendra Murkambi could not be reached.Shree Renuka also makes ethanol (or, ethyl alcohol) from molasses, a by-product of the cane crushing process. Ethanol can be used as a biofuel and can be added to petrol.The company has been looking for assets in Brazil, where valuations are comparatively attractive despite high sugar prices. It processed about 0.65 million tonne of raw sugar between October 2008 and September 2009, and plans to refine 1.2 million tonne in the ‘09-10 sugar year.India, the world’s biggest consumer of the sweetener, is likely to import 7 million tonne this year since a lower area under cultivation and poor monsoons have hit cane output. During the current sugar calendar (October-September), the country is likely to produce 15.5 million tonne, against a domestic consumption of about 23 million tonne for the second year.The Shree Renuka stock lost 5.3% to close at Rs 180.55 in a weak Mumbai market on Friday, putting the company’s market capitalisation at Rs 5,722 crore.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/Renuka-Sugars-to-submit-final-bid-for-Brazilian-co/articleshow/5540594.cms

Customer shrinkage is typically lesser than 1%, but in value terms the figures can be big,��� said the person, requesting anonymity.The most stolen merchandise by Indians included electronics, cosmetics, alcohol/food, clothing and jewellery as they are small, lightweight and easy to conceal and transport.Kumar Rajagopalan, president, Retail Association of India, said the survey is being unfair to India. ���In India, modern retail is only 5% of the total retail, and 95% is still non-modern retail, the survey is being unfair to the market.���According to him, modern retailers who have been in the business for more than three to four year know how to handle shrinkage and have managed to put in place systems that take care of shoplifting and employee shrinkage. The actual shrinkage rate for modern retailers, he said, would be less than half of what the survey found.���Major factors to worry about are accounting errors and stock loss because of dumps and wastage,��� he said.

In fact, companies and governments must insist that their employees go work cold turkey once in a while, especially immediately after intense bouts of hard work.Going cold turkey for religious reasons is as old as religions or maybe, older. In fact, religious prohibitions may have helped people preserve their faith, identity and health. Research shows that any religious ban or temporary refrain on consumption and action has practical considerations as well. Our prophets seemed to have taken into account everything from weather to hygiene to welfare of their people before writing edicts on dos and don’ts . Since the time we started recording history, physicians across faiths have advised fasting as a therapy to feel better and look better.Another friend who attended a Vipassana course near Delhi rightly pointed out that going cold turkey is possible without even realising it. Of course, there are myriad ways to distract oneself and go cold turkey. Politicians contesting elections do that. A hard day’s night gets a new meaning in poll campaigning which, ironically, is one of the many ways our politicians keep fit.To be sure, going cold turkey or being forced to do that is as old as the human race. Later when kingdoms emerged, brothers asked brothers to go kingdom cold turkey. The list of examples is endless even in regimes that had no emperors. Comrade Mao Zedong himself had forced Deng Xiaoping to go politics cold turkey and banished him to China’s hinterland.To cut a long story short, one should not feel that going cold turkey, of one’s own volition or by force, is always bad.

LN Mittal of Indian sugar: Meet the man who’s taking Renuka global,[],https://img.etimg.com/photo/65498029.cms,2010-02-23T03:57:00,"MUMBAI | NEW DELHI: His penchant for spotting and lapping up troubled assets has already earned him the sobriquet ‘the LN Mittal of Indian sugar’. True to that, Narendra Madhusudhan Murkumbi, co-founder and MD of Shree Renuka Sugars, has set a simple goal for his firm: to be the world’s biggest sugar company.“I think we are within striking distance,” he told ET from his hotel room in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on Monday after announcing the acquisition of Equipav — Brazil’s seventh-largest sugar and alcohol company.Murkumbi, 39, is the master of makeover. Instead of setting up new factories, he acquires old and preferably ailing sugar mills, or leases them if buying is not a possibility. Out of his eight factories in India, seven have been acquired from a slew of owners that range from state governments, cooperatives, public sector and private companies.This inorganic growth catapulted the engineering graduate from Belgaum with an IIMA degree in just 11 years from picking up the pieces of a failed biopesticides company to running a Rs 6,000-crore Indian conglomerate, with interests in sugar, fuel, energy and international commodity trading.“I believe the acquisition creates synergy between the two largest sugar-producing countries. The best practices of both companies will be incorporated in Equipav,” says analyst Jonathan Kingsman, who runs the Paris-based eponymous consultancy.Surviving in Brazil won’t be an easy task. Murkumbi’s new competitors will include giants such as Bunge, Louis Dreyfus, Royal Dutch Shell and Cargill. But Murkumbi is unfazed.“I truly believe that investing overseas is a complementary part of being an Indian food company,” he says.Plus, he is used to brickbats. Rivals are already sniggering at his audacious acquisition. “Why should we bother about Brazil when the entire UP sugar sector is up for sale at a price,” quipped the CEO of another sugar company.But criticism has never stopped Murkumbi from going off the beaten path in true entrepreneurial spirit. He set up India’s first standalone sugar refinery to process imported sugar, that too when the country was exporting sugar. Today, it allows SRSL to be the biggest beneficiary from Indian sugar deficit.“He is the first person to have set up independent sugar refineries. Here onwards the trend to use refined sugar will only go up. It makes sense — business as well as environmental — to import raw sugar and sell refined one,” said Shivajirao Giridhar Patil, advisor, National Federation of Co-operative Sugar Factories.Murkumbi was the first to co-opt cane farmers as shareholders because he believes in their prosperity lies his strength. He also pays them one of the highest prices for cane paid anywhere in the country. That cushions his factories from raw material shortage.He was the first to realise that he needed a diversified business model as a hedge against the vagaries of weather-related crop failure, crash in sugar prices or unfavourable government policies. SRSL was among the first to start producing ethanol for the Indian fuel market. It was also the first to figure out the value of carbon credits and create a revenue stream out of burning cane straw in the factory boilers, a routine practice in all Indian sugar factories.Impressed by this string of out-of-box ideas and the creation of a highly successful modern agri-business, ICICI Bank appointed Murkumbi a director on its board, its youngest-ever director.But success rarely comes overnight and Murkumbi is no exception. It was not easy for the inexperienced mother-son team of Vidyatai Murkumbi, chairperson SRSL, and Narendra Murkumbi, to break into in the closed world of sugar barons where family names are more valuable than balance sheets.“My mother is my inspiration. She keeps me going ahead. Her strength is admirable,” says Murkumbi.A top official of the Maharashtra Co-operative Sugar Federation, requesting anonymity, described the Murkumbis as “politically astute”. Stories are abound how Mrs Murkumbi, chairperson SRS and Narendra’s mother, is in the good books of important politicians from UP chief minister Mayawati to Sharad Pawar, the uncrowned king of the sugar sector. Narendra Murkumbi was President Pratibha Patil’s first choice when she was looking for someone to revive her ailing sugar factory.“But the best thing about Murkumbis is they keep equidistant from all of them,” the official said.So what’s next on Murkumbi’s agenda after returning to India? “I want to spend more time with my two daughters,” says the fond father, who happily spent time organising the younger one’s birthday party earlier this month. “She is more sociable than us,” he chuckles.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/LN-Mittal-of-Indian-sugar-Meet-the-man-whos-taking-Renuka-global/articleshow/5605525.cms
Diageo's scotch pricing fails to cheer local cos,"['Bokurian', 'Nandini Sen Gupta']",https://img.etimg.com/photo/65498029.cms,2006-09-22T01:54:00,"BANGALORE/NEW DELHI: India’s negotiations with EU on lowering tariff barriers for providing better market access to imported spirits is set to flare up with global drinks giant Diageo hitting the country with cheap scotch, and looking to drive down the price further.Diageo’s locally bottled scotch whisky, Haig, is set to hit some markets like Chandigarh at Rs 350/400 for a quart and at around Rs 400/450 in Punjab, sources told ET. Haig’s roll out price in Delhi is pegged at Rs 550 and in Goa, at Rs 430.Earlier, Diageo had unveiled a price tag of Rs 600 for Haig in Mumbai, which in itself, had raised alarm bells for the domestic spirits industry.Haig’s Rs 350-450 pricing is bound to eat into some of the most profitable Indian whiskies like Royal Challenge and Blender’s Pride. In context, Diageo’s cheap scotch whisky strategy could come under scanner with concerns of “dumping and unfair pricing”— shipping of bulk scotch at par or below prevailing market cost by taking advantage of the economies of scale — cropping up fresh.A top honcho of a leading liquor MNC told ET on condition of anonymity: “Frankly, if we were to do it, we would not have managed to hit the market at prices Diageo is doing now.” Diageo was unavailable for comments despite repeated attempts. An email questionnaire also remained unanswered.UB group chairman Vijay Mallya said the ground realities have not changed for the Indian spirits industry to give up opposing reduction in tariffs. The bulk imports for local bottling attract about 150% basic duty, while bottled-in-origin (BIO) products attract between 246% and 550% taxation, including the basic and additional levies, which were imposed as protective tariffs when Quantitative Restrictions (QRs) on alcoholic beverages were lifted in ’01.EU and the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) have been opposing additional duties, stating it was inconsistent with WTO regulations. “EU has not addressed our concerns on agricultural subsidies (on scotch whisky) inputs. Moreover, we are clear that the issue of access to Indian market is linked with our products being allowed a fair access to EU markets,” Mr Mallya said, while adding that his group was not perturbed by Diageo’s latest moves.Diageo’s MNC counterparts fear a renewed domestic backlash, especially since allegations of “under-invoicing” levelled against another overseas company some years back fuelled a campaign for protective tariffs soon after QRs were removed. However, scotch whisky players also say that since Haig is not a BIO brand, the duty differential question should not arise.Observers said Diageo’s play was to ambush the market in anticipation of reduction in import tariffs. “We do not see them making any money on the current arrangement unless there is a fall in levies in the near future,” they said. Diageo, sources added, was getting aggressive on India and China, the two fastest growing markets, where it currently has a peripheral presence.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/liquor/Diageos-scotch-pricing-fails-to-cheer-local-cos/articleshow/2015646.cms
Family businesses in India see rise of women as promoters and leaders,"['Lijee Philip', 'Rica Bhattacharyya', 'Kala Vijayraghavan']","https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-34067828,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-123468,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2014-04-22T04:00:00,"“It is a belated effect of what is happening in society,” says Ashvini Chopra, MD & CEO of Universal Trustees, a firm that helps business families in succession planning. When it comes to women in business, this change pivots around three aspects.The first is education. “Parents who would typically give professional education, including overseas exposure, only to their sons are now also encouraging daughters,” says Prabir Jha, chief HR officer, Reliance Group, speaking in general and not in reference to the Ambani family. “Their entry into business responsibilities is then a logical corollary.”Secondly, family size is shrinking. Joint families are becoming nuclear, resulting in a fall in the number of male heirs. “In many families it’s a father and son and daughter like situation. And daughters are the heir apparent,” says Kavil Ramachandran, Thomas Schmidheiny Chair professor of family business and wealth management at Indian School of Business. “Also many families are realising that girls are as good as, or better than, boys in performance.”For some like Sulajja Firodia Motwani, vice-chairperson of Kinetic Engineering, all this was a given. “A combination of a good atmosphere at home, freedom to do what we wanted and treating daughters like sons encouraged me to get into the family business,” she says. While she feels this is how it should be, Piramal says it’s still not the case in all families and inequalities manifest themselves in many forms. “We are only half way there,” she says. “There are several prominent business families where daughters are not at the forefront of handling businesses in terms of true equality.”That leads to the third pivot of change: an amendment in the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, in 2005, which removed gender discrimination in inheritance in Hindu joint families. Previously, only the male line, down to the great-grandson, had inheritance rights. The amendment gives women an equal share in the family business. “Even women married before 1994 can come back and claim equal rights into the family business as well as inherited assets,” says Sameer Tapia, senior partner at ALMT Legal.But the exciting, radical change is happening in operations, and Tapia offers some sense of its magnitude. “We have at least 40 per cent family-business clients where women are playing an active role in the family business, and are part of crucial strategy or execution teams.” And many, like the four women profiled here, are leaving an imprint.Unlike many, if not most, women scions in India, Lakshmi Venu had a point of reference on the gender question. Her mother, Mallika Srinivasan, is the chairperson and chief executive of tractor company Tractors and Farm Equipment Limited. But Lakshmi, 31, gravitated towards the businesses managed by her father, Venu Srinivasan—auto-component company Sundaram-Clayton and two-wheeler firm TVS Motor. In 2010, Lakshmi was inducted as director-strategy and whole-time director of Sundaram-Clayton. In May 2011, she was also made vice-president in charge of global business strategy at Sundaram-Clayton.It capped close to a decade of her involvement with the family business. Back in 2003, Lakshmi joined as a management trainee in Sundaram Auto Components. She also did stints in business strategy, design, corporate affairs, and sales and marketing at TVS Motor. Lakshmi declined comment for this profile.But senior auto industry professional RL Ravichandran, who has worked in a senior position in TVS Motors, says Lakshmi was interested in the business from early on. Even with her impeccable academic qualifications, he adds, she earned her way through various roles. “(It’s why)…there was no resistance from employees when she was inducted on to the board.”Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a senior TVS manager who interacts with Lakshmi describes her as “level-headed” and “business-like”. She currently manages the entire component business, which includes die cast, rubber, plastics and seats. “She is handling the business well and it is showing results,” he adds. Unlike Lakshmi, brother Sudarshan Venu, 24, had an easier entry into Sundaram-Clayton, joining its board in 2011.According to VG Ramakrishnan, managing director of Frost & Sullivan, a consultancy, it’s a good sign when scions spend time in the business rather than being parachuted into it. “Children are being groomed to take over executive roles and responsibilities right from the beginning as part of effective succession planning,” he says. “It shows the progressive nature of these companies.”In 2011, Lakshmi married Rohan Murty, son of Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy. Her lineage aside, she is seen as a leader in her own right. Anil Singhvi, founder and director of Institutional Investor Advisory Services, a proxy shareholder advisory firm, has been baying against the tendency of business families to induct women scions into the board simply to meet the new rule of minimum women representation. But for Lakshmi, he says: “She is competent to take the business forward.”When a 21-year-old Bhairavi Jani returned from the US in 2000, after a year of working as a supply-chain consultant in KPMG’s Washington DC office, she battled two stereotypes as she tried to make her mark in the male-dominated Indian logistics business industry: gender and age. “There were people who did not want to work with me, who thought I was probably amusing myself for a few years before being married off,” she says. “And then there were customers, even MNCs, who refused to give business to a young woman, who they were sure would fail miserably at logistics planning.”Her father had thrown her into the deep end, and told Jani to learn to swim. Instead of making her a part of Blue Dart, his flagship before he sold it to DHL in 2004, Tushar Jani stumped his elder daughter by asking her to set up her own venture. “His view was that people from family-owned businesses tend to take things for granted,” says Jani, now 34. “Going through the pain of setting up a venture would teach me two things: never be afraid to take risks and value what it takes to sustain a business.”So, Jani set up i3pl, to provide end-to-end logistics services to corporate clients. After initially struggling for business, i3pl obtained its first client in M&M, and subsequently signed up British Petroleum, Sara Lee and Walt Disney, among others. Jani roped in partners in 2003 and, in a planned exit, sold out to them in 2005.That same year, Jani assumed the role of group director for the SCA Group, which has four verticals: warehousing, supply chain technology, cargo handling and freight forwarding, and shipping, respectively. At present, she provides strategic and operational guidance, operating as a link between the board and professionals; she also directs new projects and is in charge of joint ventures and alliances.Jani set up the warehousing vertical, via a company called Transmart India, in 2007. Percy Dhunjisha, a former CFO of Blue Dart Express and a person who had worked closely with her father, was her mentor there. He describes her as a searching and questioning manager. “Bhairavi’s management style is, forethought is better than afterthought,” he says. “She does not accept things as they are presented, but will often probe enough with questions to determine whether there is an alternate way of doing things and whether the same has been considered before arriving at the solution presented.”At SCA, she has her father’s backing. “Daughters are as astute and sharp in financial management, balance sheet and P&L [profit and loss] accounting, says Tushar Jani. “I have always believed in that. Therefore, Bhairavi has always been given full charge of our projects and companies, including P&L responsibility. And like any CEO, she has been answerable to the board.”Gender and age still come up in conversations, though. Even today, there are few women in the logistics industry, and Jani still has to face issues of equality with male colleagues and work-life balance. “But I am confident that women in leadership roles in business will pick up sharply,” she concludes.Set up in 1933, Simbhaoli Sugars has seen four generations of the Mann family nurture it. But in that journey, women from the family, though present as shareholders and promoter-directors, were conspicuously absent on the frontline. Gursimran Mann, belonging to the fourth generation, changed that.In 2005, just 21 and out of college, she joined Simbhaoli— a business with inert appeal to the young and a workforce in which women made up less than 1%. In doing so, she was turning her back on options available to her like consulting and investment banking. She even considered joining a consumer products or an agri-trading company, having done internships with Nestle, Cargill and ED&F Man.“It was my decision,” says Mann. She grew up in the Simbhaoli factory compound, in rural Uttar Pradesh, listening to conversations about the business and watching sugar being made. “This background, combined with my training in economics, made me realise the opportunity that existed for me to help grow the business further.” The only child, she did not immediately start reporting to her father and chairman Gurmit Mann. Joining as a trainee, Mann worked in various departments—factory, farm operations and trading —reporting to different people.“My promotions were not on auto mode,” she says. After completing her MBA from London Business School, Mann became an executive director in 2012 and managing director in July 2013. At Simbhaoli, she counts among her achievements increasing asset utilisation, partnering with global sugar trading company ED&F Man, setting up sugar refinery on the Gujarat coast to tap the import-export play, reducing the cyclical nature of the sugar business by pushing the power and the alcohol business, building a consulting vertical that advises other companies on all things sugar, and raising new capital from private equity. “She has taken the challenge to professionalise the business,” says Devin Narang, India MD of Singapore-based PE fund Sindicatum, which has invested in the company.For Mann, it’s all in a day’s work. “There is an overall social and cultural change, leading to a change in mindset among business families regarding acceptance of daughters to take charge,” she says.The middle of three daughters, Arathi Krishna was the first women in her family to join the business, in 1989, when she was just 20. “I had an easy transition into the company,” says Krishna, now joint managing director of auto-component major Sundram Fasteners. “I was easily accepted by employees.” Acceptance from the industry has followed. The 45-year-old spearheads the Rs 2,651 crore company’s domestic business.“This is a logical succession,” says Sonu Iyer, partner & diversity and inclusiveness leader, Ernst & Young India, a consultancy. “The daughters [younger sister Arundathi is in charge of overseas operations and business development] have grown up in an entrepreneurial set up, and it’s only natural for them to be entrepreneurs and also do it better.”According to Arathi, her parents gave her an environment to flourish and the freedom to choose. “There was no difference between a son or a daughter,” she says. “My parents are very progressive, willing to take risks and pushed us to pursue our interests. But they never pushed us into the business.” Arathi did an MBA from the US. She stayed on, first to work in automotive strategy with a consulting company and then with Sundram Fasteners for five years. “I knew I would, at some point, come back and join the business,” she says.“So, I took up jobs in the US that were related to the business. I wanted to make myself worthy when I came back to join the business.” Arathi returned to India in 2006, and became joint MD in 2011. Arathi counts among her achievements making the workforce at Sundram Fastners younger, and the work culture more performance-based and technology oriented. Around 2005, the average age of the Sundram workforce was 40 years; it’s now down to 35 years.In her earlier years, at industry meets, Arathi would feel out of sorts in what was essentially a man’s world. “But then, I felt it was tougher to work in a Japanese or a Korean company,” she says. At present, 10% of Sundram’s workforce is made of women. “We have always believed in equality at the workplace. We are promoting more women to join the manufacturing ranks in the company.”",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/Family-businesses-in-India-see-rise-of-women-as-promoters-and-leaders/articleshow/34067802.cms

Customer shrinkage is typically lesser than 1%, but in value terms the figures can be big,��� said the person, requesting anonymity.The most stolen merchandise by Indians included electronics, cosmetics, alcohol/food, clothing and jewellery as they are small, lightweight and easy to conceal and transport.Kumar Rajagopalan, president, Retail Association of India, said the survey is being unfair to India. ���In India, modern retail is only 5% of the total retail, and 95% is still non-modern retail, the survey is being unfair to the market.���According to him, modern retailers who have been in the business for more than three to four year know how to handle shrinkage and have managed to put in place systems that take care of shoplifting and employee shrinkage. The actual shrinkage rate for modern retailers, he said, would be less than half of what the survey found.���Major factors to worry about are accounting errors and stock loss because of dumps and wastage,��� he said.

Her strength is admirable,” says Murkumbi.A top official of the Maharashtra Co-operative Sugar Federation, requesting anonymity, described the Murkumbis as “politically astute”. Stories are abound how Mrs Murkumbi, chairperson SRS and Narendra’s mother, is in the good books of important politicians from UP chief minister Mayawati to Sharad Pawar, the uncrowned king of the sugar sector. Narendra Murkumbi was President Pratibha Patil’s first choice when she was looking for someone to revive her ailing sugar factory.“But the best thing about Murkumbis is they keep equidistant from all of them,” the official said.So what’s next on Murkumbi’s agenda after returning to India? “I want to spend more time with my two daughters,” says the fond father, who happily spent time organising the younger one’s birthday party earlier this month. “She is more sociable than us,” he chuckles.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/LN-Mittal-of-Indian-sugar-Meet-the-man-whos-taking-Renuka-global/articleshow/5605525.cms
Diageo's scotch pricing fails to cheer local cos,"['Bokurian', 'Nandini Sen Gupta']",https://img.etimg.com/photo/65498029.cms,2006-09-22T01:54:00,"BANGALORE/NEW DELHI: India’s negotiations with EU on lowering tariff barriers for providing better market access to imported spirits is set to flare up with global drinks giant Diageo hitting the country with cheap scotch, and looking to drive down the price further.Diageo’s locally bottled scotch whisky, Haig, is set to hit some markets like Chandigarh at Rs 350/400 for a quart and at around Rs 400/450 in Punjab, sources told ET. Haig’s roll out price in Delhi is pegged at Rs 550 and in Goa, at Rs 430.Earlier, Diageo had unveiled a price tag of Rs 600 for Haig in Mumbai, which in itself, had raised alarm bells for the domestic spirits industry.Haig’s Rs 350-450 pricing is bound to eat into some of the most profitable Indian whiskies like Royal Challenge and Blender’s Pride. In context, Diageo’s cheap scotch whisky strategy could come under scanner with concerns of “dumping and unfair pricing”— shipping of bulk scotch at par or below prevailing market cost by taking advantage of the economies of scale — cropping up fresh.A top honcho of a leading liquor MNC told ET on condition of anonymity: “Frankly, if we were to do it, we would not have managed to hit the market at prices Diageo is doing now.” Diageo was unavailable for comments despite repeated attempts. An email questionnaire also remained unanswered.UB group chairman Vijay Mallya said the ground realities have not changed for the Indian spirits industry to give up opposing reduction in tariffs. The bulk imports for local bottling attract about 150% basic duty, while bottled-in-origin (BIO) products attract between 246% and 550% taxation, including the basic and additional levies, which were imposed as protective tariffs when Quantitative Restrictions (QRs) on alcoholic beverages were lifted in ’01.EU and the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) have been opposing additional duties, stating it was inconsistent with WTO regulations. “EU has not addressed our concerns on agricultural subsidies (on scotch whisky) inputs. Moreover, we are clear that the issue of access to Indian market is linked with our products being allowed a fair access to EU markets,” Mr Mallya said, while adding that his group was not perturbed by Diageo’s latest moves.Diageo’s MNC counterparts fear a renewed domestic backlash, especially since allegations of “under-invoicing” levelled against another overseas company some years back fuelled a campaign for protective tariffs soon after QRs were removed. However, scotch whisky players also say that since Haig is not a BIO brand, the duty differential question should not arise.Observers said Diageo’s play was to ambush the market in anticipation of reduction in import tariffs. “We do not see them making any money on the current arrangement unless there is a fall in levies in the near future,” they said. Diageo, sources added, was getting aggressive on India and China, the two fastest growing markets, where it currently has a peripheral presence.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/liquor/Diageos-scotch-pricing-fails-to-cheer-local-cos/articleshow/2015646.cms
Family businesses in India see rise of women as promoters and leaders,"['Lijee Philip', 'Rica Bhattacharyya', 'Kala Vijayraghavan']","https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-34067828,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-123468,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2014-04-22T04:00:00,"“It is a belated effect of what is happening in society,” says Ashvini Chopra, MD & CEO of Universal Trustees, a firm that helps business families in succession planning. When it comes to women in business, this change pivots around three aspects.The first is education. “Parents who would typically give professional education, including overseas exposure, only to their sons are now also encouraging daughters,” says Prabir Jha, chief HR officer, Reliance Group, speaking in general and not in reference to the Ambani family. “Their entry into business responsibilities is then a logical corollary.”Secondly, family size is shrinking. Joint families are becoming nuclear, resulting in a fall in the number of male heirs. “In many families it’s a father and son and daughter like situation. And daughters are the heir apparent,” says Kavil Ramachandran, Thomas Schmidheiny Chair professor of family business and wealth management at Indian School of Business. “Also many families are realising that girls are as good as, or better than, boys in performance.”For some like Sulajja Firodia Motwani, vice-chairperson of Kinetic Engineering, all this was a given. “A combination of a good atmosphere at home, freedom to do what we wanted and treating daughters like sons encouraged me to get into the family business,” she says. While she feels this is how it should be, Piramal says it’s still not the case in all families and inequalities manifest themselves in many forms. “We are only half way there,” she says. “There are several prominent business families where daughters are not at the forefront of handling businesses in terms of true equality.”That leads to the third pivot of change: an amendment in the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, in 2005, which removed gender discrimination in inheritance in Hindu joint families. Previously, only the male line, down to the great-grandson, had inheritance rights. The amendment gives women an equal share in the family business. “Even women married before 1994 can come back and claim equal rights into the family business as well as inherited assets,” says Sameer Tapia, senior partner at ALMT Legal.But the exciting, radical change is happening in operations, and Tapia offers some sense of its magnitude. “We have at least 40 per cent family-business clients where women are playing an active role in the family business, and are part of crucial strategy or execution teams.” And many, like the four women profiled here, are leaving an imprint.Unlike many, if not most, women scions in India, Lakshmi Venu had a point of reference on the gender question. Her mother, Mallika Srinivasan, is the chairperson and chief executive of tractor company Tractors and Farm Equipment Limited. But Lakshmi, 31, gravitated towards the businesses managed by her father, Venu Srinivasan—auto-component company Sundaram-Clayton and two-wheeler firm TVS Motor. In 2010, Lakshmi was inducted as director-strategy and whole-time director of Sundaram-Clayton. In May 2011, she was also made vice-president in charge of global business strategy at Sundaram-Clayton.It capped close to a decade of her involvement with the family business. Back in 2003, Lakshmi joined as a management trainee in Sundaram Auto Components. She also did stints in business strategy, design, corporate affairs, and sales and marketing at TVS Motor. Lakshmi declined comment for this profile.But senior auto industry professional RL Ravichandran, who has worked in a senior position in TVS Motors, says Lakshmi was interested in the business from early on. Even with her impeccable academic qualifications, he adds, she earned her way through various roles. “(It’s why)…there was no resistance from employees when she was inducted on to the board.”Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a senior TVS manager who interacts with Lakshmi describes her as “level-headed” and “business-like”. She currently manages the entire component business, which includes die cast, rubber, plastics and seats. “She is handling the business well and it is showing results,” he adds. Unlike Lakshmi, brother Sudarshan Venu, 24, had an easier entry into Sundaram-Clayton, joining its board in 2011.According to VG Ramakrishnan, managing director of Frost & Sullivan, a consultancy, it’s a good sign when scions spend time in the business rather than being parachuted into it. “Children are being groomed to take over executive roles and responsibilities right from the beginning as part of effective succession planning,” he says. “It shows the progressive nature of these companies.”In 2011, Lakshmi married Rohan Murty, son of Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy. Her lineage aside, she is seen as a leader in her own right. Anil Singhvi, founder and director of Institutional Investor Advisory Services, a proxy shareholder advisory firm, has been baying against the tendency of business families to induct women scions into the board simply to meet the new rule of minimum women representation. But for Lakshmi, he says: “She is competent to take the business forward.”When a 21-year-old Bhairavi Jani returned from the US in 2000, after a year of working as a supply-chain consultant in KPMG’s Washington DC office, she battled two stereotypes as she tried to make her mark in the male-dominated Indian logistics business industry: gender and age. “There were people who did not want to work with me, who thought I was probably amusing myself for a few years before being married off,” she says. “And then there were customers, even MNCs, who refused to give business to a young woman, who they were sure would fail miserably at logistics planning.”Her father had thrown her into the deep end, and told Jani to learn to swim. Instead of making her a part of Blue Dart, his flagship before he sold it to DHL in 2004, Tushar Jani stumped his elder daughter by asking her to set up her own venture. “His view was that people from family-owned businesses tend to take things for granted,” says Jani, now 34. “Going through the pain of setting up a venture would teach me two things: never be afraid to take risks and value what it takes to sustain a business.”So, Jani set up i3pl, to provide end-to-end logistics services to corporate clients. After initially struggling for business, i3pl obtained its first client in M&M, and subsequently signed up British Petroleum, Sara Lee and Walt Disney, among others. Jani roped in partners in 2003 and, in a planned exit, sold out to them in 2005.That same year, Jani assumed the role of group director for the SCA Group, which has four verticals: warehousing, supply chain technology, cargo handling and freight forwarding, and shipping, respectively. At present, she provides strategic and operational guidance, operating as a link between the board and professionals; she also directs new projects and is in charge of joint ventures and alliances.Jani set up the warehousing vertical, via a company called Transmart India, in 2007. Percy Dhunjisha, a former CFO of Blue Dart Express and a person who had worked closely with her father, was her mentor there. He describes her as a searching and questioning manager. “Bhairavi’s management style is, forethought is better than afterthought,” he says. “She does not accept things as they are presented, but will often probe enough with questions to determine whether there is an alternate way of doing things and whether the same has been considered before arriving at the solution presented.”At SCA, she has her father’s backing. “Daughters are as astute and sharp in financial management, balance sheet and P&L [profit and loss] accounting, says Tushar Jani. “I have always believed in that. Therefore, Bhairavi has always been given full charge of our projects and companies, including P&L responsibility. And like any CEO, she has been answerable to the board.”Gender and age still come up in conversations, though. Even today, there are few women in the logistics industry, and Jani still has to face issues of equality with male colleagues and work-life balance. “But I am confident that women in leadership roles in business will pick up sharply,” she concludes.Set up in 1933, Simbhaoli Sugars has seen four generations of the Mann family nurture it. But in that journey, women from the family, though present as shareholders and promoter-directors, were conspicuously absent on the frontline. Gursimran Mann, belonging to the fourth generation, changed that.In 2005, just 21 and out of college, she joined Simbhaoli— a business with inert appeal to the young and a workforce in which women made up less than 1%. In doing so, she was turning her back on options available to her like consulting and investment banking. She even considered joining a consumer products or an agri-trading company, having done internships with Nestle, Cargill and ED&F Man.“It was my decision,” says Mann. She grew up in the Simbhaoli factory compound, in rural Uttar Pradesh, listening to conversations about the business and watching sugar being made. “This background, combined with my training in economics, made me realise the opportunity that existed for me to help grow the business further.” The only child, she did not immediately start reporting to her father and chairman Gurmit Mann. Joining as a trainee, Mann worked in various departments—factory, farm operations and trading —reporting to different people.“My promotions were not on auto mode,” she says. After completing her MBA from London Business School, Mann became an executive director in 2012 and managing director in July 2013. At Simbhaoli, she counts among her achievements increasing asset utilisation, partnering with global sugar trading company ED&F Man, setting up sugar refinery on the Gujarat coast to tap the import-export play, reducing the cyclical nature of the sugar business by pushing the power and the alcohol business, building a consulting vertical that advises other companies on all things sugar, and raising new capital from private equity. “She has taken the challenge to professionalise the business,” says Devin Narang, India MD of Singapore-based PE fund Sindicatum, which has invested in the company.For Mann, it’s all in a day’s work. “There is an overall social and cultural change, leading to a change in mindset among business families regarding acceptance of daughters to take charge,” she says.The middle of three daughters, Arathi Krishna was the first women in her family to join the business, in 1989, when she was just 20. “I had an easy transition into the company,” says Krishna, now joint managing director of auto-component major Sundram Fasteners. “I was easily accepted by employees.” Acceptance from the industry has followed. The 45-year-old spearheads the Rs 2,651 crore company’s domestic business.“This is a logical succession,” says Sonu Iyer, partner & diversity and inclusiveness leader, Ernst & Young India, a consultancy. “The daughters [younger sister Arundathi is in charge of overseas operations and business development] have grown up in an entrepreneurial set up, and it’s only natural for them to be entrepreneurs and also do it better.”According to Arathi, her parents gave her an environment to flourish and the freedom to choose. “There was no difference between a son or a daughter,” she says. “My parents are very progressive, willing to take risks and pushed us to pursue our interests. But they never pushed us into the business.” Arathi did an MBA from the US. She stayed on, first to work in automotive strategy with a consulting company and then with Sundram Fasteners for five years. “I knew I would, at some point, come back and join the business,” she says.“So, I took up jobs in the US that were related to the business. I wanted to make myself worthy when I came back to join the business.” Arathi returned to India in 2006, and became joint MD in 2011. Arathi counts among her achievements making the workforce at Sundram Fastners younger, and the work culture more performance-based and technology oriented. Around 2005, the average age of the Sundram workforce was 40 years; it’s now down to 35 years.In her earlier years, at industry meets, Arathi would feel out of sorts in what was essentially a man’s world. “But then, I felt it was tougher to work in a Japanese or a Korean company,” she says. At present, 10% of Sundram’s workforce is made of women. “We have always believed in equality at the workplace. We are promoting more women to join the manufacturing ranks in the company.”",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/Family-businesses-in-India-see-rise-of-women-as-promoters-and-leaders/articleshow/34067802.cms
Assembly elections: Why it would be an uphill task for Congress & not for BJP,['Praveen S Thampi'],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-51374205,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-23307,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2016-03-13T07:00:00,"Another year, another round of state assembly elections . However, the BJP can breathe easy this time, after the humiliating losses in Delhi and Bihar. It is advantage BJP right at the outset. It has nothing to lose, could, with luck, form the government in Assam, open its account in Kerala and, in Tamil Nadu, and a proto-ally trounce an alliance of which the Congress is a part.For the Congress, it would be an uphill task to retain either Assam or Kerala, and avoid being left with Karnataka as the lone major state under its control.For the Left, two of the three states where it has a major presence are at stake. Today, Tripura is the lone state over which the red star shines. After splitting the anti-BJP votes in Bihar by going it alone, the Left is now rediscovering a friend in the enemy of the enemy, and hoping to have an understanding with the Congress in Bengal, even while taking it on, with full dialectical might, as the principal opponent in Kerala.This alignment of political fortunes explains the serene calm prevailing over 11 Ashoka Road, as compared with the feverish activity in the BJP HQ during the polls for Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Haryana, Delhi, Bihar and even Jammu and Kashmir. But life is more hectic on the other side of the political divide. For the grand Opposition that has so far been able to match every move of the Narendra Modi government despite the BJP’s numerical might in Lok Sabha, this round of state polls means a lot. A helluva lot.For starters, the Congress is staring at a real possibility of losing one of the only two big states it rules. All the three opinion polls conducted in Kerala in the last one month show the Oommen Chandy government is on its way out. The party itself doesn’t hope much from Assam where it has to battle a 15-year-old anti-incumbency.Gaurav Gogoi, he of the Rahul Gandhi brigade, bravely commented that in Assam 2016 it will be 15 years of his father Tarun Gogoi’s rule versus two years of Narendra Modi government. But as we explain in the following pages, it seems Gogoi Sr will have to bow out and the Congress’ best-case scenario would be a hung assembly where the BJP will have to face the embarrassing possibility of courting Badruddin Ajmal’s All India United Democratic Front to come to power in Guwahati.For the Left too, it is a battle for national relevance. The CPM has been punching above its weight in both Houses of Parliament. To carry on with the same gumption, the party will have to not only wrest Kerala but also put up a decent show in West Bengal. That’s easier said than done in Kolkata where Mamata Banerjee and her Trinamool Congress (TMC) seem poised to come back to power for another five years with as big a victory as in 2011. The political curiosity in Bengal is the Cong-CPM alliance that was unthinkable only a few years ago. Add to that the X-factor in the BJP that made the party mysteriously scale itself down after a lot of bombast a year ago.The poll season then kicks off with clear advantage to the two strong women of Indian politics: the Amma and the Didi. In Tamil Nadu, which often is a world of its own when it comes to politics, the Opposition is a divided house. While Jayalalithaa’s doles, ranging from idlis to laptops, have created a constituency of her own, the principal opposition DMK is yet to offer a compelling reason why it must be brought back to power.For BJP watchers, the irony is that the party might earn more seats from Kerala than from Bengal where it once challenged Mamata. All opinion polls and field reports indicate that the BJP could open its tally in Kerala for the first time in history and could even get three-five seats in the 140-member assembly. Cut to Bengal: the party would be happy to hold on to the single seat it had won in a bypoll after the 2014 general elections where it netted a 17% vote share.And what do these elections mean for changing the Opposition’s ability to dominate the Rajya Sabha? Precious little. Whoever wins in Kerala, Bengal or Tamil Nadu, no seats will accrue to the BJP. A few additional seats in Assam will not, by itself, tilt the balance in the Upper House.By G SeetharamanCHENNAI: Few regional political scions have had to wait as long in the wings to become chief minister as 63-year-old Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin has. He was a deputy chief minister in Tamil Nadu, running the show during his father M Karunanidhi’s regime, and was declared heir apparent, but has never held the coveted title. The upcoming assembly poll, on May 16, is no different, with the alliance led by their party, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), declaring Karunanidhi, who turns 92 in June, as its chief ministerial candidate.Stalin may not have the top job, at least not initially, if the alliance wins — he will be deputy CM — but this election, more than any in the past, will be a reflection of his political chops and popularity among the masses. Between September last year and February, Stalin visited all 234 constituencies as part of his Namakku Naame (We for Ourselves) initiative. The primary objective of the roadshow, during which Stalin swapped his traditional veshti for trousers to meet youngsters, was to highlight his and the DMK’s approachability compared with chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s, who heads the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), the arch-rival of the DMK.One of the criticisms of Jayalalithaa has been her aloofness from the people and her party’s attempt to score political points even during the recent floods in the state. “When she went to her own constituency RK Nagar (in Chennai) after the floods, she was there for only half an hour and addressed people as ‘Vaakaala perumakkale (Dear voters)’. She is anti-people,” says KS Radhakrishnan, a DMK spokesperson.The Jayalalithaa government got a lot of flak for its initial handling of the floods in November-December in five districts — Chennai, Kanchipuram, Cuddalore, Tuticorin and Thiruvallur — which killed around 470 people and displaced thousands. Relief material came with Jayalalithaa stickers on them and the party held an ostentatious meeting in Chennai after the floods. The government partly restored its reputation through its rehabilitation efforts.The government’s handling of the floods and Jayalalithaa’s conviction by a special court in Bengaluru in the disproportionate assets case are among the few specific charges being bandied about by AIADMK’s opponents. She was disqualified as chief minister and was in jail for 21 days before being acquitted by the Karnataka High Court. “There is no issue with an emotional appeal, like the 2G spectrum scam of 2011.Jayalalithaa’s opponents talk of sycophancy, corruption and lack of inner-party democracy in the AIADMK because there is no other significant issue,” says Maalan V Narayanan, consultant editor with Puthiya Thalaimurai, a Tamil weekly. The last time an incumbent party won the Tamil Nadu assembly polls was in 1984.Jayalalithaa, 68, is riding high on a host of welfare schemes, which her party is sure to talk up during the campaign. “The free rice scheme (20 kg a month to each ration-card holder) has helped in tackling poverty to an extent,” says Narayanan. Other government schemes offer free kits for newborns; gold for women to make mangalsutra; laptops and bicycles for students; fans, mixergrinders and televisions for households. The AIADMK defied expectations and won 37 of 39 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, thanks in part to some of these schemes. An issue that seemed to unite all opposition parties last year was the call for prohibition, but it has lost steam. The AIADMK is expected to field more female candidates to take the edge off the demands for prohibition.The government is the sole seller of alcohol and earns a lot from it — alcohol sales will reportedly account for about Rs 30,000 crore in tax revenue in 2015-16, nearly a third of the state’s total tax receipts. The 73-day gap between the announcement of poll dates and polling has sent parties into a tizzy since they have to be prudent about when to name their candidates and when to start campaigning, to keep their expenditure under control and avoid fatigue among voters. “We have to see if the long gap has an impact on the campaign crystallising around the government’s welfare schemes,” says an AIADMK source.In 2011, Jayalalithaa was able to trounce DMK not just because of the 2G scam, which saw Karunanidhi’s daughter Kanimozhi and the party’s A Raja, who was Union telecom minister, going to jail. She ensured that the anti-DMK votes were not split, by joining hands with actor Vijayakanth’s Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK). The DMDK, founded in 2005, had hoped to emerge as an alternative to both the DMK and the AIADMK and fought its first three elections alone, getting over 10% of votes in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls. In the 2011 assembly polls, the DMDK won 29 of the 41 seats it contested, with about 8% of the votes.With the AIADMK getting a simple majority, the DMDK sat in the opposition and Vijayakanth became the leader of the Opposition, which was a humiliating blow to Karunanidhi; DMK had won just 23 seats. Things have since been going downhill for Vijayakanth. Thanks to the rising influence of his wife Premlatha and her brother LK Sudheesh, the party has lost nine MLAs since 2012, all of whom have joined the AIADMK. With his constant lashing-out at Jayalalithaa since 2011, Vijayakanth effectively ruled out an alliance with her this time.However, in the past few months, he was sought by different political groups: the DMK; a BJP-led coalition, which has so far failed to convince any major party to join it; the People’s Welfare Alliance, which has Vaiko’s Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK), Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi and the Communist parties.The DMDK, according to sources, had demanded that Vijayakanth be named the CM candidate of the BJP alliance, which the national party turned down. The Pattali Makkal Katchi, which is projecting former Union health minister Anbumani Ramadoss as its CM candidate, also demanded the same of the BJP.Earlier this week, Karunanidhi said that he was confident of the DMDK joining its alliance, which includes its old ally, the Congress. However, Vijayakanth said at a rally in Chennai on March 10 that his party would fight it alone, which means that he would split the anti-AIADMK votes, which is precisely what the DMK wanted to avoid.Some say the DMDK is essential to the DMK’s defeating the AIADMK. According to an opinion poll by CVoter and India TV, the AIADMK alliance, which includes some small parties, will win 116 seats and the DMK-Congress combine 101. The DMDK could have added some heft to the DMK alliance, since it is believed to have a 5% vote share. Interestingly, Tamil Nadu has never had a coalition government. (DMDK leaders were not available for comment. ) “People of Tamil Nadu do not vote for someone, they vote against someone. The anger against Jayalalithaa is very palpable and the DMK has lost all self-confidence. They were desperate for an alliance with the DMDK,” says Ramadoss. He adds that the DMDK’s not joining the DMK alliance is an advantage for his party, which released a draft manifesto as early as September last year.“A DMK-Congress alliance is more than enough to win the poll,” says EVKS Elangovan, president of the Congress state unit. “But we thought like-minded parties should join to make it formidable.” On the other side of the political battle, there is speculation that the BJP might join the AIADMK combine. L Ganesan, a member of BJP national executive, says the central leadership took charge of alliance negotiations about two weeks ago. But work has already begun in all constituencies.Both DMK and AIADMK will benefit from the fact that two cases are unlikely to conclude in the Supreme Court before polls: the Enforcement Directorate’s case related to a financial transaction between the DMK-run Kalaignar TV and DB Group in the 2G scam, and the disproportionate assets case against Jayalalithaa.As alliances are close to being finalised, social media and messaging platforms like WhatsApp are expected to play a big role. It was evident in the DMK’s advertisement targeting Jayalalithaa for not meeting the people, and the AIADMK’s counter about Karunanidhi’s absence in the assembly.Being the only state among the four large poll-bound ones — Assam, Kerala and West Bengal being the rest — where the two main national parties are marginal players, Tamil Nadu is sure to be an exciting political stage in the next two months. What make the scenario even more interesting are two factors: a weak anti-incumbency and whether Vijayakanth can play spoiler and hurt the DMK’s chances.By Madhuparna DasKOLKATA: When the talk of the town is the strange coming together of two Opposition parties struggling for survival in Didi’s Bengal, you may think the outcome is a nobrainer in favour of the Iron Lady of Kolkata. But the Left and the Congress believe there is enough anti-incumbency in the state after five years of Mamata Banerjee’s rule, which they can reap by holding hands.When Congress leaders walked into the CPM headquarters on Alimuddin Street, Kolkata, as part of the talks to forge some sort of a combined front in the imminent polls to the state assembly, barriers that stood for decades were breached — literally and metaphorically.The outcome for West Bengal, on May 22, will depend a lot on how the “alliance” shapes up and, if at all, takes root. For starters, everyone is trying to explain away this beast. Announcing the first list of Left candidates last week, CPM veteran Biman Bose ruled out any joint campaign with Congress and even any “jote ba ghont (alliance or ganging up)”.Mamata, although wary about the potential harm from a united opposition, reacted with her trademark smirk. She immediately pointed to farflung Kerala where the Left and the Congress are at each other’s throats in the state election that coincides with West Bengal’s. “What is the point of holding election in Kerala? The Congress and the CPM can divide the seats between them evenly. I really do not understand the moral ground of their alliance in Bengal, when in Kerala they are fighting each other,” said Mamata. For good measure, she added that she would go to Kerala and “expose” the real face of the Congress and the CPM.As things stand in West Bengal, Mamata seems poised to come back to power for another five years with as big a victory as in 2011. For the first time, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) is going it alone, having tasted success in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls when it junked partner Congress. It bagged 34 seats and reduced the Left to just two; the Congress won four and the BJP two. For Amit Shah’s BJP, good news will be hard to come by from Bengal. The 2014 Lok Sabha polls saw a surge for the party in the state and it looked ready for a takeoff with a huge Bengali Hindu refugee vote bank.The BJP had planned to enter the eastern gateway via Bihar, but that was not to be. In West Bengal, meanwhile, the party seemed to be winning new ground in Birbhum and Burdwan. But the inadequacies of leadership and internal squabbles frittered away a golden opportunity. If Shamik Bhattacharya — the only BJP MLA in the assembly —manages to hold on to his seat in Basirhat (South), it would be a tremendous feat.The Mamata government has been banking on development as its main plank for this election. Stressing on the development projects she has taken up in the state, the chief minister never tires of narrating the efforts her government has been making to pull the state out of debt burden. Apart from the revenue model that she has implemented, Mamata has also been projecting two success stories: in Junglemahal, the Maoist bastion where a peace deal was struck, and Darjeeling, which was hit for a long time by violence associated with the Gorkhaland movement.Lack of investment and industry has been a major stumbling block. A deep sea port, coal block in Pachami and the MSME sector have been some consolation. Didi is confident, so is her party. What, then, is left for the “non-alliance” between the Left and the Congress? According to political observers, their electoral understanding might increase the vote share for the opposition. In 2011, the TMC could secure 184 seats. The TMC-Congress alliance got 226, with Congress getting 42, while the Left Front wound up with 62.Explaining the political situation, Biswanath Chakraborty, a professor and political analyst, says, “To form a formidable opposition, the Congress and the CPM needed to be united in some form. If there is seat adjustment between these two parties, the joint figure can reach 100 or maybe more. If they fight a lone battle, they will end up below 30.” “Even though, the ideologies and structures of the two parties are poles apart, they needed an alliance to get the status of the opposition. We know that the CPM was not able to form booth committees in many districts as their cadres had joined the TMC out of political compulsion,” adds Chakraborty.Meanwhile, the first casualty of an alliance between Congress and CPM would be the greater Left unity that Left Front chairman Biman Bose has advocated. The CPI(ML) and SUCI (C) have now decided to come out of the Left unity in Bengal.The CPM has already announced its candidates in 116 seats and the list looks bold. Chakraborty points out that the party has fielded 68 young faces as candidates, which is close to 60%. “This means that the party has a future plan,” he says. The contours of the Left-Congress deal have to be worked out, but party leaders say there are likely to be few ego tussles simply because of the enormity of the challenge in front of them. The CPM list leaves enough space for the Congress to focus on its strongholds in north Bengal. The CPM leaders would have you believe that with the Congress on board, north Bengal will ditch Didi.The battle then is going to be in south Bengal where, the TMC believes, Mamata will have a walkover. While we have to wait two more months to find out who ditched whom, the Election Commission is looking at one certainty: a violence-ridden poll, considering West Bengal’s recent history. Following complaints of poll violence from the opposition parties, the EC has started sending Central forces to the state.They have initiated area domination and route march in districts as part of “confidence-building measures”. According to a senior officer of the CRPF, till the first phase of elections, close to 400 companies would be deployed in the state. For six phases of polls, around 800 companies will be there.Polls in Bengal — whether municipal, panchayat or general election — have always been marred by violence. Mamata has already come out with what looks like a veiled warning. Recently, she said quite candidly that the Central forces would not be in the state forever; and that once the elections are over, she herself and her administration would be in charge. Abdur Rezzak Mollah, a rebel CPM leader who joined the TMC recently, said in a public meeting soon after: “Will you be able to have a peaceful sleep ever, after the Central forces are withdrawn from the state? Only we will be there to provide security then.” The Left, and their “non-ally” Congress, hope they too will be around post May 22.By Ishani DuttaguptaMintu Paul is a 22-year-old, finalyear student of electronics and telecommunication engineering in Jadavpur University ( JU). Besides his classes and exams, there is something else that is keeping Paul busy these days. As a student coordinator for the JU placement cell, he is working with placement officers of the university and companies looking to recruit on campus. “Our placements improved last year and this year we hope to do even better. Although there were student agitations on campus recently, none of the companies who recruit our students and hold campus interviews have given us any negative feedback so far,” says Paul, who got a job offer from Pricewaterhouse-Coopers in the last placement season.Like him, Samita Bhattacharyya, who heads the training and placement cell, doesn’t see either the recent student agitation or the upcoming state election as a cause for concern. “Our students are our biggest asset. After last year, which saw a record in terms of the number of placements and salaries offered, recruiters are coming back to the campus for more.”JU is one of the few varsities in India with science, engineering and arts faculties on the same campus, with a student strength of over 9,000. Despite protests and slogans, some of which were said to have been anti-national, vice-chancellor Suranjan Das did not resort to first information reports against students nor did he allow the police on campus. “JU has always stood for freedom of expression and autonomy and we will solve the problem through discussions. That has always been JU’s tradition,” Das had said.Where’s the problem, then? “Capturing pioneer institutions is the primary agenda of the RSS-BJP so that they can preach communalism wrapped in violence,” said Arumita Mitra, a student leader at JU, who spearheaded the recent agitation and is a member of the All India Students’ Association, the student wing of CPI(ML). “This has to be fought by students.” At the other end of the political spectrum, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), BJP’s student wing, alleged that activism on the JU campus was fuelled by anti-national elements.“There were anti-national slogans and posters on campus. It is shocking that the state government is quiet on this issue and the university has not yet taken any steps to book the culprits,” said Kishore Burman of the state ABVP unit.Student unrest that spread across the country in the wake of the suicide of Hyderabad University’s Rohith Vemula and the arrests at JNU is palpable on Bengal campuses too. With the state election due in less than a month, political activism is set to peak. “What we are seeing on many campuses across India are attacks by the government on freedom and democratic student movements. In most cases, like in JU, independent student bodies are reacting to such crackdowns. Such protests are likely to intensify in the coming months,” said Kunal Chattopadhyay, professor of comparative literature in JU.Not too far away, on College Street, the heart of Kolkata’s academic district, another vice-chancellor, Anuradha Lohia of Presidency University, faced criticism for withdrawing permission to the alumni association to hold a seminar on “Freedom of Expression and Students’ Politics”. “I was approached by the alumni association, seeking permission to hold the event, but they had not mentioned that it was open to all and that’s why we had to call it off,” Lohia told ET Magazine in an exclusive interview. She feels that while healthy and democratic discussions among the student community have been the strength of Presidency over the years, too much of activism could lead to violence and disruption of academic activities on the prestigious and heritage campus.About 100 km from Kolkata, the state government-run Burdwan University (BU) saw clashes between the Left-backed Students’ Federation of India and the nonteaching staff backed by the ruling Trinamool Congress. The bone of contention: irregularities in the publication of BU’s results. “I deeply regret the violence on campus and take moral responsibility for it,” BU vice-chancellor Smriti Kumar Sarkar told ET Magazine. “We are under intense pressure to hold exams of over 50,000 candidates before the elections in April so that results can be published by June and students can apply for jobs as well as admissions to other institutions.”At Visva Bharati, vice-chancellor Sushanta Duttagupta was dismissed last month by President Pranab Mukherjee after he was found guilty of misconduct and financial irregularities by an HRD ministry panel. Duttagupta alleges that he was unfairly targeted by some sections of the staff and campus residents because he was an outsider. “Provincialism and nepotism have hit the standards of what was Rabindranath Tagore’s dream of a global hub of academic excellence. With so much political interference in the academic and administrative matters of Visva Bharati, things will only get worse in the months to come,” he rued.By S SanandakumarKOCHI: Just what do you do when you have a leader who is more popular than the party itself? Celebrate him or sideline him? Well, that’s the nature of the conundrum that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) faces as it enters the poll season where every survey, every pundit predicts that the CPM-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) will trump the ruling Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF).VS Achuthanandan, better known as VS, is the name that’s both the bane and the boon of the CPM. The 92-year-old outspoken leader — the only living founding member of the CPM — continues to be the most popular politician in the state although the party’s Kerala unit would rather have him lead the campaign than be the chief ministerial candidate himself. It is on this wedge that the Congress and a scandal-ridden chief minister, Oommen Chandy, rest their hopes.That the internal contradictions of the CPM will ultimately let the anti-incumbency wave wither away. That there could be a repeat of the 2011 election, when the outgoing LDF government, led by VS, was almost voted back to power, but the party lost barely due to its reluctance to project old man VS as the CM candidate.Cut to 2016, and there is a palpable sense of déjà vu, but the CPM central leadership has moved in right on time to douse the faction fire. In a rare intervention, the CPM politburo has decided that both VS and his antithesis Pinarayi Vijayan — who enjoys a brute majority in the state party unit — should contest the polls. A CM will be chosen post polls.Kerala is not a state kind to its politicians. It doesn’t vote back an incumbent to power these days. But Chandy’s five-year tenure, which saw a wave of scams and controversies from Day One, doesn’t need history’s help to justify the anti-incumbency wave. However, what’s keeping both the fronts awake is the dramatic rise of the BJP in the recent panchayat polls. With a veteran Hindutva hardliner, Kummanam Rajashekharan, as a surprise state head, the BJP feels it is all set to open its account in Kerala assembly.Not only has it altered the bipolar political structure of the state, dominated by the LDF and the UDF, it has also prompted the coalitions to adopt more aggressive postures in a do-or-die battle for political supremacy in Kerala 2016. Kummanam, while taking over the leadership of the party from V Muraleedharan, had said that his goal is not just to open the BJP’s account in the state assembly.The aim is to capture power in the state this time, he said. The BJP’s confidence stems from the 18% vote share that it got in the local body polls in the state in 2015. It shows a steady increase from 6.1% in the 2011 assembly polls and 10.83% in the 2014 general election. Apart from a pro-BJP mood created by the Narendra Modi government at the Centre, the party also had an electoral understanding with Vellappally Natesan, the general secretary of the SNDP Yogam, for the local body polls. The SNDP represents the Ezhava, the largest Hindu community, and has traditionally been a source of strength for the CPM. Vellappally’s new party, the Bharat Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS), is now part of the NDA.The BJP pins its hopes on the capital district of Thiruvananthapuram from where five of its top leaders, including Kummanam and Muraleedharan, would contest. O Rajagopal, who lost to Shashi Tharoor by a whisker from the Thiruvananthapuram Lok Sabha constituency in 2014, will also contest from the district. Pre-poll surveys by different agencies do not give more than five-six seats for the NDA. But even if the BJP manages to get one member into the assembly, it would have breached a psychological barrier.Chandy came to power in 2011 with a wafer-thin majority of two seats — which has gone up to four after bypoll victories. The deft politician who has perfected the art of playing his rivals — inter- and intraparty — against each other would have been holding strong had it not been for the unceasing waves of scams, a few of them directly connected to the chief minister’s office. After the “solar scam” where a couple duped investors and consumers of crores of rupees, promising them solar panels, Chandy had to sack three of his key CMO staffers besides his gunman. The resignation of finance minister KM Mani in the bar-bribery case, the adverse comments made by the Thrissur Vigilance Court against Chandy and excise minister K Babu in the bar-bribery case will haunt the UDF.However, Chandy’s accessibility and his public outreach programmes where he would dole out money to the poor and the needy — the Opposition says this is feudal in nature — had kept him largely popular. Chandy is also betting on the mega projects that he has been implementing in the state like the Kochi metro rail project, the Kannur airport project, the Vizhinjam international container terminal and the Smart City project in Kochi. In fact, there has been such a surge of inaugurations in the past one month, just before the election code of conduct kicked in, that his critics refer to the CM disparagingly as “Inauguration Chandy”.Not all party colleagues of Chandy share his optimism on the poll outcome. “The factional feud in Congress is bitter,” said a Congress leader on condition of anonymity. The ‘A’ group, with Chandy as its leader, would try to prevent the ‘I’ group, which has home minister Ramesh Chennithala as its leader, from gaining an upper hand, he said. Moreover, they feel that the sharp fall in the prices of key commodities like rubber, cardamom, etc, would affect the prospects of the party adversely.The Congress’ biggest ally, the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), has gone ahead and announced its 20 candidates. That they didn’t wait to discuss it within the UDF has already become a controversy, with the Catholic Church expressing its displeasure with one of the constituencies where the IUML is fielding its candidate. Congress leader Pandalam Sudhakaran said that despite all this, senior party leaders are confident about coming back to power. “Our reading is that we have an upper hand as of now,” he said. “If there are no last-minute setbacks, we are sure of coming back to power,” he said.The decision of the Election Commission to hold the election in Kerala on May 16 has given the parties ample time to prepare. One problem that the candidates are likely to face is the shortage of adequate resources to see them through the long campaign period. One Congress leader said that he may not contest this time because he does not have enough funds. “Earlier the bar owners used to give election donations. This time they will spend to defeat us,” he said. The 2016 election can be historic in many ways. For the BJP in Kerala, a victory in even a single seat is enough to create history. For Oommen Chandy, a victory will help break the trend of the two coalitions winning alternate elections. For the Left, if it fails to win Kerala, it will cease to be a national player.By Shantanu Nandan SharmaGUWAHATI: In the evening of Shivratri, Himanta Biswa Sarma, a former Congress rebel who is now convener of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) election management panel for Assam, organised a family puja at his Uday Path residence in Guwahati. A terse instruction was left at the bungalow’s gate not to let anyone in even as party workers, ticket seekers and those protesting the tie-up between the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and the BJP queued up outside to meet him. As the priest chanted mantras, Sarma was checking email and the latest news on his iPad and taking calls that he considered unavoidable.Earlier in the day, thousands of BJP workers went on a rampage in protest against the alliance with AGP, targeting mainly Sarma who, they believed, was the man behind the party strategy of leaving 24 “winning seats” to the AGP.Angry grassroots workers tore posters and banners as local news channels covered the events live, with some agitators threatening a mass resignation. They believe Sarma was the mastermind who convinced Ram Madhav, national general secretary in-charge of Assam, to engineer this pact, without taking on board the local leaders and workers. Some protesters dubbed Ram Madhav “Rabon”, the Assamese pronunciation of Ravan.Says Sarma: “The main concern in Assam is that Bangladeshi Muslims comprise 32% of the total population of Assam (Muslims as a whole make up 35% of the population, the remaining being the Assamese Muslims who have been in the state for about 800 years). They entered the state illegally and later managed to get voting rights. To counter that, we have a rainbow alliance not just with the AGP, but with tribal communities of Bodo, Tiwa and Rabha. It’s the fight of 32 versus 68.” Sarma is explaining the rationale behind cobbling up an alliance that risks alienating a large chunk of local BJP leaders and workers who have opposed to leaving their seats to AGP, the regional party that ruled Assam twice (1985-1990 and 1996-2001), but drew a blank in the 2014 parliamentary elections.For the BJP, this rainbow alliance is a big gamble. Whipping up the emotive issue of Bangladeshi immigrants may work in lower Assam (middle and western Assam) and also in Barak Valley, where Muslims make up 46% and 37% of the population respectively. These are also the regions where local residents claim to have been victimised by illegal migrants. But the same formula is unlikely to yield any dividend in upper Assam where the Muslim vote percentage is quite negligible, an area where the party had swept during the Lok Sabha poll.If the opinion polls aired by a local Assamese TV channel are any indication, the Congress will be the single largest party, short of a majority. However, an opinion poll conducted by CVoter put the combine of the BJP-Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) ahead of the Congress; this poll, though, did not take into account the AGP joining the alliance.Though the “32 versus 68 formula” sounds good in theory, the impact of the BJP-AGP tieup can’t be explained by pure mathematics. After all, the AGP, which was formed in 1985 by student leaders participating in an antiforeigners agitation (1979-1985), is also a symbol of Assamese chauvinistic forces, something that alienates Hindu Bengalis who have a sizeable population in urban areas across the state. Also, the AGP had steadfastly opposed the BJP’s move to give refugee status to Hindu migrants from Bangladesh. The tie-up led the Congress to concentrate more on this segment, which had solidly backed the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha poll.Within the AGP, a section of senior leaders including two-time Assam chief minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta was not very happy with what was labelled in some quarters as a “surrender” to BJP. According to a party insider who did not want to be named, Mahanta went to Delhi last week for a health check-up in Apollo hospital, and when a colleague suggested that he accompany him to BJP president Amit Shah’s residence, he obliged. Shah reportedly agreed to the 24 seats for the time being, and more seats could be negotiated; the negotiations, however, did not materialise. “Yes, at a personal level, I did not want a tie-up with the BJP. But as a disciplined soldier of the party, I accepted the pact in the greater interest of dislodging the Congress from power,” says Mahanta.For almost three months, the AGP had kept the door open to an alliance with the BJP or the Congress. The AIUDF Angle After the Nitish-Lalu formula worked in Bihar to defeat the BJP, a similar experiment was planned for Assam. Badruddin Ajmal, a businessman, religious leader and politician, had a sitting with Bihar CM Nitish Kumar to work out a similar model for anti-BJP political forces in Assam.“Nitish Kumar initiated the alliance talks. He called up Rahul Gandhi. Prashant Kishor (poll strategist and Nitish’s aide) then met Rahul. But (Congress general secretary in charge of Assam) CP Joshi played a game and misled Rahul,” claims Ajmal, chairman of the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) which, in its 11 years of existence, has become a political force to reckon with in Assam.In a scenario where neither the BJP nor the Congress can form a government of its own, the AIUDF, which is likely to contest in 60-odd seats, could be the kingmaker. Its spokesman Champak Kalita says the party would choose the “bad” over the “worse”, indicating that it would prefer the Congress to the BJP in any post-poll calculation. If the Lok Sabha votes in 2014 were to translate into assembly segments, the AIUDF would win 24 seats, but now its popularity has waned because of a strong anti-incumbency wave against its MLAs (of its 18 legislators, two have joined the Congress) and due to Ajmal’s inability to clear the air on whether he has any tacit pact with the Congress or the BJP.The BJP has already issued a list of 88 candidates, the most notable being the MP from Jorhat, Kamakhya Prashad Tasa, and the chief ministerial candidate Sarbananda Sonowal in Majuli, a 421 sq km river island off the Brahmaputra that falls in Lakhimpur Lok Sabha seat, which Sonowal represents. For the Congress, the strategy now is to rope in BJP dissidents — former president of the All Assam Students’ Union and BJP leader Sankar Prasad Rai, among others, joined the Congress on Tuesday — and somehow resist polarisation along a religious line.When Rahul participated in a padyatra in Sibsagar early this month, the local leadership made it a point to highlight his visits to Muslim areas as well as to Shiva Dol, a temple built by an Ahom king. “Padyatras are so successful that every district Congress committee wants Rahul to do one in their district,” says AICC spokesman and MP Gaurav Gogoi, indicating that Rahul’s campaign in the coming days will be a mix of walks and big rallies. The big question, of course, is whether Rahul Gandhi can walk the talk and resist a 15-year-long anti-incumbency in the northeastern state.CP Joshi (Congress general secretary in charge of Assam) was influenced by Himanta Biswa Sarma on this. Joshi misguided Rahul Gandhi about this alliance. Nitish Kumar had initiated the alliance talks. He called up Rahul. Prashant Kishor (poll strategist and Nitish’s aide) then met Rahul. But Joshi played a game and misled Rahul. The AGP initially wanted to ally with the Congress. And I won’t be surprised if the AGP becomes the first party to leave the BJP and join the Congress after the polls.We are equidistant from the Congress and the BJP. The BJP says the Congress has an understanding with the AIUDF, and the Congress says the BJP has an understanding with the AIUDF. The reality is both these parties are worried of the meteoric rise of the AIUDF.We will be contesting in about 60 seats. I can say this for sure: no party can expect to form the next government without our support. But we will never give support to the BJP because of ideological reasons.Himanta Biswa Sarma, convener, BJP election management committee, AssamThe main concern in Assam today is that Bangladeshi Muslims comprise 32% of the total population of the state. They entered the state illegally and managed to get voting rights later. They have enjoyed economic and social rights here. But with Badruddin Ajmal forming a communal party, some of them began dreaming of taking over Assam politically. To counter that, we have a rainbow alliance not just with the AGP, but with the tribal communities of Bodo, Tiwa and Rabha. It’s the fight of 32 (percentage of Bangladeshi Muslims) versus 68.The Congress and the AIUDF are together, but they are not announcing it openly because the Congress fears they will lose the mainstream voters. A post-poll alliance between the Congress and the AIUDF is a foregone conclusion. There is no question of the BJP aligning with the AIUDF even after the elections. The AIUDF’s base is illegal Muslim migrants.The AGP-BJP pact does not have an ideological basis. It is guided by vested interests. It may be an alliance formed in Delhi, but at the grassroots, the party workers of the AGP and the BJP are burning each other’s offices, posters, etc. People of Assam are already seeing a trailer of what is in store in case the AGP and the BJP jointly run a government.For two years, there was internal dissidence in the Congress which, like a virus, weakened our organisation at the grassroots. Now, the Congress is a united house, and all of us have been working in sync. The problem is more in the BJP now. All their senior leaders who spent decades building the party in Assam have been sidelined. And who is at the forefront? The people who joined a few years ago.Rahul Gandhi is focusing not just on taking part in big rallies, but on reaching out to various communities such as teachers, women, intellectuals, journalists and spiritual leaders across Assam. His three padyatras in the state got an unprecedented response. The BJP is imitating it now. Their CM candidate has been participating in mini padyatras.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/Assembly-elections-Why-it-would-be-an-uphill-task-for-Congress-not-for-BJP/articleshow/51374116.cms
Ranbaxy's Singhs ready to build empire,"['Moinak Mitra', 'Bhanu Pande']","https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-4412365,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-14815,overlay-etpanache/photo.jpg",2009-04-17T04:37:00,"The long, winding stretch dotted by an assortment of exotic foliage amid moderate mist leads to a cul-de-sac with ���26��� etched firmly against a pinkish gate.Away from the heat and dust of a parched Delhi, the mirage-like Westend Greens in Rajokri is now the chosen home of executive-entrepreneur Malvinder Mohan Singh, who straddles his day job at Ranbaxy Laboratories as its chairman and managing director and looks into the nuts-and-bolts of Religare Enterprises and Fortis Healthcare as chairman, in his spare time.Malvinder inherited the three-acre undulating farmhouse from his late father Parvinder Mohan Singh, who was credited with transforming Ranbaxy into a global pharma powerhouse, before passing away in 1999 owing to cancer in the oesophagus.Like the number etched outside his current home, Malvinder was 26 then ��� a junior manager at Ranbaxy and Parvinder Singh had just passed on the reins of managing the company to his trusted lieutenant Davinder S. Brar. A decade later, Malvinder had no qualms about selling the family heirloom (Ranbaxy) to Japanese innovator company Daiichi-Sankyo last year for a record Rs 28,006 crore enterprise value. The Singh family surrendered their 34.8% stake in the company for a whopping Rs 9,576 crore, and is now sitting on a treasure trove that Malvinder dubs his ���war chest������ at least for the next decade, or so.Though pharma flowed in the veins of the Singh brothers, it was arithmetic that really made them swoon. While the 34 year-old Shivinder Mohan Singh can passionately dwell on the nuances of game theory, Malvinder has had stints with American Express Bank and Merrill Lynch as investment banker before signing up for Ranbaxy.In the early to mid-1990s, Parvinder Singh chalked out a vision for his group. ���Beyond pharma, he was looking at pathology, health insurance and healthcare,��� says Shivinder, adding that in 1997-98 when his father knew that death was imminent and his two sons were rather ���tender���, he decided to sell 50% of the healthcare business to IL&FS ���with the intention of giving away management control and becoming a silent partner���.So in July 1999, when Parvinder Singh passed away, the brothers were driving down Delhi���s Ridge Road and on the spur of the moment, firmed up plans for buying back the equity with IL&FS. ���In August, I came back to Delhi from Mumbai and called Shivinder in America (he was pursuing his MBA at Duke University) and said ��� we���ve got it,��� elaborates Malvinder, recalling how Fortis Healthcare and the entrepreneurial journey of the two brothers began. Of course, the then 26 year-old Malvinder saw the big picture. That perhaps explains why friends and colleagues call the soft-spoken, animated Sikh MMS, just like they dub his moreeconomical-with-words brother SMS.Though the seeds of the financial and healthcare companies were sown by Parvinder Singh as early as the 1990s, little did he know that his sons would actually steer growth and seek opportunities in domains that in his lifetime remained largely secondary to his pharma empire. While Malvinder worked as an executive in Ranbaxy until he was elevated to company CEO in 2006, he prodded his brother to complete his MBA a term earlier and return to India in 2001 to take on the reins of Fortis Healthcare.The family also possessed a small broking business based out of Delhi and Mumbai called Fortis Finance, that largely catered to high net worth individuals. After closing his own business, family friend Sunil (Sunny) Godhwani approached the brothers one day with a complaint about Fortis Finance.Instead of addressing Godhwani���s woes, the family asked him to take on Fortis Finance with a caveat ��� ���I said whatever money he (Godhwani) recovers, he should invest back into Fortis Finance as I won���t be giving him any new money for expansion,��� says Malvinder. That���s how Religare was born, with a handful of people and zero cash balance. ���As for Religare, we���ve actually made an ICU patient win an Olympic gold medal,��� quips Malvinder, reflecting the stupendous growth logged in by the company from an income of Rs 320-odd crore in 2006-07 to about Rs 897 crore the following fiscal.Today, Godhwani is a close confidante and part of the inner circle of the family. His importance as one of the three directors of the group companies (Religare and Fortis) reflects the trust placed in him by Malvinder, mirroring the faith his father once placed on his professional manager DS Brar.True, the professional manager-owner lines have been sharp and clear for the second generation running in the Singh family but it was Godhwani who brought the New York-based Mehta partners to the Singh brothers to cut the Daiichi deal.The Mehta partners had deep insights into Japanese systems and processes and a natural flair with Japanese companies, and Godhwani kicked in as the go-between. But sources close to the family see a larger, if not more spiritual, connect. ���Sunny���s father was very close to Nimmi���s (Malvinder���s and Shivinder���s mother) brother and a friend of the family, and a devout follower of the Radha Soami Satsang Beas (RSSB) cult,��� informs the source.Now, Nimmi was the daughter of Maharaj Charanjit Singh, the cult���s guru. RSSB, that goes by the tagline ��� ���Science of the Soul��� ��� had a profound effect on Parvinder Singh in the 1960s, as he gave up alcohol and turned vegan. In the early 1990s, there was even serious speculation that he would succeed his father-in-law as RSSB���s guru.That said, Shivinder���s words echo out loud and clear. With all that cash around, there are bound to be opportunities and the brothers will not desist from exploring anything and everything, steering clear of anything to do with alcohol and non-vegetarian food. ���You should think of us as businessmen doing private equity. We may do healthcare and financial services, but that doesn���t stop us from owning chunks of other businesses. But we will not do anything that goes against our family values ��� so we will not do anything in alcohol or non-veg.���With the shift in family business from manufacturing to services, Malvinder compliments his role as getting the best of both worlds. ���On one hand, I���m running the business of Ranbaxy of which I���m not an owner today, while on the other, I���m an entrepreneur who���s got business interests spanning different sectors.��� In the process, he received a lot of flak for his acquisitive temperament. ���We created an Indian MNC (Ranbaxy), which is now a Japanese company,��� says DS Brar, withjust a hint of remorse. However, he is quick to clarify how Malvinder had a desire to making it big in financial services right from his college days. In their heyday, Brar and Parvinder Singh grew Ranbaxy by setting up factories in India and abroad, relying less on an inorganic footprint.Enter Malvinder and in came a pariah to the more serious-looking world of pharmaceuticals. An old office hand even claims how Malvinder changed the dress code at Ranbaxy overnight by walking in and out in casuals. Then in 2002, Ranbaxy carried out an internal survey, which proved that in order to garner 1% of India���s pharma market, it would take the company 10-12 years. That, claim sources, was the nail in the coffin and paved the way for Malvinder���s acquisitive spree with an eye on emerging markets.Until then, Ranbaxy���s focus was largely the developed world. Taking on the mantle of CEO in 2006, Malvinder made six acquisitions in that year alone. Numbers, too, tell a story. The emerging markets contribution to the total sales of Ranbaxy stood at 45% in 2005, which went up to 54% in 2007, and now stands at 69%. Similarly, developed market contribution slipped from 44% to 40% to 28%, in the same time-frame.Somehow, Malvinder���s footwork doesn���t seem to keep pace with his handiwork; he rests at home with a torn ligament in his left leg. It���s hard to keep one���s eyes off the Souzas and other paintings dotting the Art Deco ante chamber of the Singh residence. That the brothers are fond of painting is a matter of media folklore.But few may be aware of their transformational business plan in artscape. Religare Arts Initiative is already into the business of arts as an alternate investment option and the 15,000 sq ft Religare arts.i gallery in Delhi, opened last year, is the first physical manifestation of this initiative.���Today, if you want to buy a painting, you have to buy a whole piece, but down the line, you may buy 10% or 15% of the painting, just like in the stock market,��� reveals Malvinder. Also, through the Vistaar-Religare film fund, they have produced 2-3 movies, and have 5-6 more in the pipeline. In the same vein, as the brothers saw an opportunity with more people using private charters, they created a fleet on lease.That was how Religare Voyages Limited came into being. Also, as ET recently reported, Religare is on the verge of acquiring controlling stake in Maharishi Housing Development Finance Corporation (MHDFC) for an undisclosed amount.

New Game, New Rules“Flying international is a completely different ball game,” says Mark D Martin, an aviation industry veteran, who previously headed low-cost carrier SpiceJet’s strategy. “IndiGo is known for its consistency and an efficient business model that give it an edge in the hotchpotch domestic aviation market, but the global market is an uncontrolled environment where it will be dealing with different procedures, regulations and cultures,” says Martin, who has advised the Directorate General ofIndiGo happens to be a late entrant in a market where fullservice and budget carriers have established a strong footprint.

In others, it will face competition from Singapore Airlines and low-cost rivals such as Air Asia, Tiger Airways and Air Arabia. Domestic competitors too are spoiling for a fight.Hot on the heels of IndiGo’s bigbox fleet announcement came an order from bigger rival Jet Airways for 10 A330s planes worth $2.5 billion. Low-cost carrier SpiceJet, owned by Sun Group’s Marans, has ordered 30 Airbus planes valued at $2.7 billion and 15 more planes from Bombardier for $500 million. Wadia Group-promoted GoAir has ordered 72 planes for $7.2 billion.SpiceJet, which flies to Kathmandu and Colombo, is also due to start flights to “South Asian and West Asian countries by August or September”, the airline has said. GoAir will start international operations from 2013, says the airline’s sales general manager, Praveen Nair.Aviation watchers and company insiders also expect a slugfest of fares in the market with nearly every airline due to lower ticket prices. Competition is going to rise and it is not going to be easy for anyone,” says a senior Air India official asking not to be named. The national carrier sharply reduced airfares than even budget carriers on select domestic routes after a crippling pilot strike recently.Safe BetFor its part, IndiGo will clone its domestic model, which has earned it plaudits, revenues and market share, in the international operations, says the persons familiar with the airline’s operations. IndiGo president Aditya Ghosh declined repeated requests for an interview.On domestic routes, the airline has enabled speedy check-in facilities through hand-held devices for printing boarding passes, helping passengers avoid chaos at counters. IndiGo has also deployed step-less boarding ramps for the elderly and handicapped.The carrier boasts of the industry’s best on-time performance and least flight cancellation rates, which experts say is an upshot of constantly revisiting its business model and improving efficiency in every layer of operation, including arrival and departure procedures, backend support and baggage handling.The airline is also known to invest heavily in training its staff, particularly the cabin crew and pilots. It has added glamour to travel, roping in the services of fashion designer Rajesh Pratap Singh and stylist Ambika Pillai to give a snappy look for its cabin crew.The affordability, performance and hassle-free services apart, all the salient features of the domestic model will be followed for the international operations, say the persons who requested anonymity as they are not authorised to talk to the media.Complementing these efforts will be more innovations to improve services on board, they say. The paid no-frills model will continue but with a “wide variety of food and alcoholic beverages”. There will be no in-flight entertainment system in the nine aircraft deployed for the foreign routes.IndiGo will also launch an aggressive “tongue-in-cheek” advertising campaign for the foreign routes, the persons said, adding that passengers of all countries will have the option to pay in their currency of choice. The airline will bulk up recruitment by roping in 200 pilots, 900 cabin crew and nearly 600 engineers over 18 months. “A lot of investment”, they say, will go into training pilots and cabin crew to “bring alive the IndiGo feel in the international market”. The management team is excited about the international operations, said the persons.Growing ProsperityIndiGo has prospered by remaining relentlessly focused on its key strengths.

Election Commission seeks full info on electoral bonds; Centre for 'anonymity',['Samanwaya Rautray'],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-68824592,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-722541,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2019-04-11T08:29:00,"The Election Commission told the Supreme Court on Wednesday that it favours full “disclosure and transparency” on subscriptions to electoral bonds , while the government insisted on donor “anonymity” of the instruments to help eliminate unaccounted cash and fund polling expenses that are now among the world’s highest.The poll panel, represented by senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi , and standing counsel Amit Sharma, argued that it wasn’t totally opposed to electoral bonds, but only to the anonymous nature of the instruments. Dwivedi said that anonymity made the commission’s job of tracking donations from overseas and government companies – both legally barred at present – rather difficult.Indian units of foreign companies are allowed to donate unlimited amounts to any political party of their choice under finance bill amendments made in 2017. “We are opposed to legalising anonymity. Anonymity must go. Sources of poll funding must be made public to both the Election Commission and the people of India,” Dwivedi said. The poll panel and the government were placing their views before a three-judge bench led by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi The court is hearing a plea by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), which is seeking either a stay on electoral bonds or full disclosure as interim relief. The bench also includes Justices Deepak Gupta and Sanjiv Khanna. The panel said it had opposed the idea of anonymity from its very inception. The government, on its part, said donor anonymity was necessary to ensure that funds flow in to meet the country’s burgeoning poll expenses.Attorney General KK Venugopal said poll funding was the bane of this country. He suggested that electoral bonds were a good way of mopping up surplus money to fund election expenses. “The scheme will eliminate black money,” Venugopal said.Electoral bonds also ensured total anonymity for the donor, he said, adding that disclosures would place “industrialists” and “corporates” that wish to see a particular party in power at risk of being targeted for “backing the wrong horse.” Venugopal said electoral bonds of a particular denomination could be bought at any SBI branch and donated to any party that can encash it immediately. No one knows the purchaser.Any information on these can only be revealed as part of any criminal investigation or under a court order, he said. The bench wanted to know how electoral bonds work. The government counsel is expected to provide more details on the subject when arguments resume Thursday. He claimed that the political party receiving the funds must reveal the details to claim tax deductions.ADR, through activist lawyer Prashant Bhushan , is seeking a temporary ban on electoral bonds in the poll season or a court order on complete disclosures to ensure transparency in poll funding. He has alleged that both the Congress and the BJP have stalled efforts at clean funding of polls by opposing an order that brought the subject under the RTI. Bhushan also accused the BJP of bringing in changes to the FCRA with Opposition support to clear the path for circuitous foreign fundingthrough Indian subsidiaries.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/india/election-commission-seeks-full-info-on-electoral-bonds-centre-for-anonymity/articleshow/68824549.cms

Liquor trade raises a toast in Uttar Pradesh,['Sagar Malviya'],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-63948005,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-146656,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2018-04-28T09:23:00,"Talk of high-level liquor policy meetings in Uttar Pradesh and the image that comes to your mind maybe that of a group of stodgy politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen. But the fact is it’s a sophisticated, nuanced woman who is at the helm, and she is busy overhauling the system.Kalpana Awasthi, principal secretary of excise department in UP, has spearheaded a new policy to open up liquor business through a tender process that allowed more than three dozen wholesalers to sell alcohol in the state. This ended the virtual monopoly of slain tycoon Ponty Chadha’s family firms, which controlled nearly 80% of the state’s liquor dealership.“She is not a typical babu but a reformer and has dynamically changed the situation in an otherwise ‘Bimaru’ state,” said an official of a top liquor firm. “She has a mind of her own and is monitoring the new policy on a daily basis,” the person said.‘Bimaru’ is an acronym coined in the 1980s to describe the states of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh that were considered economically weaker.Over the past five months, Awasthi, 53, and her team have been busy implementing a new excise policy that focuses on knocking out liquor cartels and smuggling syndicates through open bidding for dealers and retailers. The new policy has also ended the special excise zone and monopoly in the state’s wholesale trade.Jai Pratap Singh, minister of excise and prohibition in Uttar Pradesh, said it took almost one year for the team to formulate the policy. “Ms Awasthi has taken up the implementation as a challenge and is doing a great job at it,” he told ET. “The core focus of the policy is to remove syndicate in the business and make it an open and fair market,” Singh said.Awasti has been meeting liquor companies for feedback and grievances almost every day.“When we briefed her about issues in implementing some of the new processes, she was reasonable and was willing to accept legitimate problems,” said an official of another liquor company. “Her main focus seems to be cleaning the system and be receptive to ideas,” the person said.From replacing the system of using holograms on bottles with ‘track and trace’ system, to barring cash transactions above Rs 30,000 for picking liquor stock from the wholesale traders, the new policy has brought in a lot of changes to check tax evasion and other irregularities in the trade. Most companies are upbeat about the reforms.Allied Blenders and Distillers, maker of Officer’s Choice whisky, the country’s largest liquor brand by volume, said it is re-entering Uttar Pradesh after a gap of nearly nine years since the new policy is impartial. “She (Awasthi) and her team are doing an amazing job in setting up compliance in system and also ensuring it remains clean going forward,” said Deepak Roy, vice-chairman at Allied Blenders and Distillers. “While the measures may be inconvenient to manufacturers initially, the intent is fair and right,” he said.A 1990 batch Uttar Pradesh cadre IAS officer and post-graduate in public policy from Duke University, US, Awasthi was late last year prematurely repatriated to her parent cadre from the department of industrial policy & promotion (DIPP) where she was director general, national productivity council. She was also a director in the PMO when Manmohan Singh was the prime minister.Awasthi is seen as a tough taskmaster. “She keeps us on the toes and there is no room for a lackadaisical approach in dealing with her and the new policy,” said a senior official of a beer company. “This could reflect in the excise revenue this year which will surge despite no price change of product pricing,” the person said. Awasthi could not be contacted for comments despite several calls to her office. As a market, Uttar Pradesh is the largest in the country, accounting for more than 10% of the overall consumer products industry. But in alcohol beverages, the state accounts for less than 5% of total sales of Indian-made foreign liquor and about 3.5% of beer.“The attractiveness of the state has increased significantly and it’s almost like we are re-entering the state,” said Ben Verhaert, president – India at AB InBev, which sells Budweiser, Hoegaarden and Corona beer brands in the country. “The state offers a great opportunity from a population point of view, which is now assisted with a reformist policy,” he said.This, in turn, will attract investments in breweries, distilleries and even restaurants. Beer Cafe, the country’s largest beer chain, said it will invest in opening five outlets in Uttar Pradesh after seeing a positive change in the policy.“The policy has made a considerable breakthrough in de-cartelising and allowing new entrants by simplifying the supply of liquor through a transparent allotment system,” said Rahul Singh, founder of The Beer Cafe. “This will allow a larger assortment to consumers while optimising the revenue for state,” he said.Beer Cafe’s Singh said UP’s new policy spearheaded by Awasthi will help “create a legitimate and responsible drinking culture for high quality liquor at affordable pricing for those who want to drink with dignity”. The new policy isn’t without initial hiccups. Three weeks after it has been implemented, the state is still witnessing shortage of several brands as companies are scrambling to replace holograms with barcodes on each bottle and carton to help track and trace products.“While the intent for a bar-code policy is to curb bootlegging and spurious liquor, we need time to import barcoding machines. Even the process to tag each bottle is tedious and takes time,” an industry official said on condition of anonymity. The government seems to be aware. “This is a temporary issue which happens during any policy change and we are in talks with companies on how best to address it,” excise minister Singh said. “It should be resolved in a few days.”The timings of liquor shops have been slashed by four hours — they can operate from 12 noon to 10 pm now, while earlier they were allowed to operate from 9 am to 11 pm.

This year, the beer industry is expected to expand 5-7%, paced by premium product launches and expansions, according to the country’s top breweries.UB, which has a market share of about 52%, will introduce a portfolio of imported beers and another strong beer brand by the end of the year.

The agnostics say they can’t suddenly start believing in God, others who already believe say they have no faith left that He can perform a miracle for them, and the atheists refuse to believe in Him. How does the AA respond?It rephrases the step as “recognising a higher power that can give strength”. It also dilutes the in-your-face impact by reiterating that when they speak of God, they mean our own conception of Him. This is apparently all that’s needed to begin the spiritual growth, and to effect our first conscious relation with God as we understand Him. That immediately shows a convenient way out for believers, agnostics and atheists alike.Like, who says that God or “higher power” has to be an external agency?

Liquor stocks on a high as prohibition plans soften,['Dia Rekhi'],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-54622481,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-38881,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg",2016-10-01T10:58:00,"MUMBAI: Shares of liquor companies surged on Friday after the Patna High Court declared Bihar's amended liquor prohibition law as 'illegal'.On Friday, shares of United Spirits (USL), the world's secondlargest spirits company by volume, closed 6.74% higher on BSE at Rs 2,462.90. United Breweries gained 2.81% to close at Rs 902.20.Pioneer Distilleries, a subsidiary of USL, surged 9.85% to Rs 241.00 while Associated Alcohol and Breweries went up 3.53% to close at Rs 116. Empee Distilleries was the biggest gainer, vaulting 13.92% to ` . 69.15.“The Patna High Court's move is sentimentally a big positive for liquor players,“ said Abneesh Roy, senior vice-president at Edelweiss Securities. “United Spirits, United Breweries and Globus Spirits are expected to be the biggest beneficiaries. However, it is important to see how the Bihar government will respond to this.“The court struck down the Bihar government's Prohibition of Liquor Act and termed it “illegal“, raising the possibility that the state will rethink its ban on sale of liquor in the state. Bihar accounts for 2-3% of sales of liquor companies, while Kerala constitutes a much larger portion of the sales pie.Earlier, the Kerala government had issued a statement saying it was mulling tweaking its liquor policy.Most analysts contacted by ET said the Kerala government could end up lifting the ban as the state is popular among tourists.Also, the state tops the list in alcohol consumption. Official estimates peg the per capita consumption of alcohol at more than 8 litres per person per year. Analysts feel that once the ban is lifted, liquor companies will benefit immensely. “Liquor companies will definitely benefit,“ said an analyst with a domestic brokerage, requesting anonymity. “It seems that states have realised that liquor is a very big revenue generator and cannot be ignored. Kerala's liquor consumption is very high, so if the ban is lifted, it will help these companies.“Shares of United Spirits have risen 6.85% since news of the Kerala government rethinking the ban began doing the rounds on Wednesday. Since then, Unit ed Breweries has slipped 0.20%, but Globus Spirits has gone up by 5.35%.Analysts, however, advise caution vis-à-vis these stocks. “Investors should not just buy the stocks based on rumours,“ the analyst quoted earlier said. “One should wait till more clarity emerges on the issue and state governments come out with a concrete plan of action.“Analysts are also skeptical about returns due to high priceto-earnings ratios of these companies. United Spirits is trading at a PE of 70.50 times FY17 estimated earnings, according to Bloomberg estimates, while United Breweries is trading at a PE of 65.64x FY17 estimated earnings.The liquor policy in Kerala had called for total prohibition in the state in 10 years. In a bid to achieve this, the government allowed about two dozen bars to operate only in five-star hotels across the state, which led more than 700 bars operating in other hotels and restaurants having to shut shop.The state government had also decided to close down 10% of the retail liquor shops on every October 2 (Gandhi Jayanti) from October 2014. This year, however, no such action will be taken, the newly elected Left Democratic Front ( LDF ) government said.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/Liquor-stocks-on-a-high-as-prohibition-plans-soften/articleshow/54622435.cms

A top DLF official confirmed the change.""This is a part of the larger DLF plan and this change was planned way back and done adequately at the right time last week,"" said the official, on condition of anonymity.Cyber Hub, which opened in October 2013, is home to about 50 restaurant brands and has about 34 bars and pubs, including the Beer Cafe, Social, Hard Rock Café and the Wine Company. The excise department has formed a committee to assess the legality of the resto-bars and pubs and others located within Cyber Hub.After the court’s verdict on Friday, there was a 20% fall in footfalls from the average of 33,000 during weekends at Cyber Hub. The resto-bars’ and pubs’ business fell by 20 per cent from average sales of Rs.3-4 lakh.""While the tenant partners are honouring the judgement by the Supreme Court, we remain concerned about the situation,"" DLF said in a statement.""However, we have been informed that there is a committee of officials who will come to measure the distance from the highway to Cyber Hub. We would like to watch and await the official intimation to us.""The SC said in its order on March 31 that no shop for the sale of liquor shall be visible from a national or state highway; directly accessible from a national or state highway and situated within adistance of 500 metres of the outer edge of the national or state highway or of a service lane along the highway. Clarifying whether the order applied only to shops involving sale of liquor, the court said that since the object of the direction is to prevent drunken driving, no such relaxation can be made which would defeat the object which is sought to be achieved.It was not clear if the 500-metre parameter referred to motorable distance from the highway or the distance as the crow flies. Owners of bars and pubs in Cyber Hub said there is uncertainty and it could take at least a month for the situation to settle.With over a third of liquor outlets located around highways, the disruption will be significant, brokerage CLSA said. ""Given restrictions around educational and religious institutions, migration may be a tough task and could take a while,"" CLSA said.The SC verdict, aimed at curbing accidents due to drunken driving – India is among the most crash-prone countries in the world – could lead to states losing tax revenue of Rs.50,000 crore, according to the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI).""The restaurants and pubs will take a hit of Rs. 10,000-15,000 crore and nearly 1,00,000 people could go out of work,"" NRAI president Riyaaz Amlani said.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/liquor/way-around-liquor-ban-dlf-cyber-hub-changes-entry-point-for-customers-to-comply-with-supreme-court/articleshow/57998759.cms
Demonetisation creates unforeseen worries at the grassroots,['Dinesh Narayanan'],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-55916515,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110875,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2016-12-11T00:35:00,"Despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s impassioned pleas, there is a unique resistance to move away from cash in some quarters. The hesitation is the legacy of the prolonged pampering by political parties of numerically powerful sections of voters. Others worry the government’s less-cash drive would deprive them of state benefits.The promoter of a large Maharashtra-based agro-processing company, which uses corn as its raw material, says his suppliers are reluctant to accept cheques. Thousands of corn farmers who supply their produce to the company are used to getting paid in cash. Until restrictions were placed on cooperative banks, the farmers had no qualms in accepting old notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominations. After the curbs were put in place, they refused to accept old notes.“Even those whom we paid in cheque have not yet deposited them in banks a week later,” the promoter told ET Magazine on condition of anonymity. He said most of the farmers had pending loan repayments because of which they did not want cash flows reflected in their bank accounts. “They tell us that they are hoping for a loan waiver close to the elections.”The Rashtriya Lok Dal led by Ajit Singh staged a rally in Delhi on December 5, demanding that the government use its demonetisation windfall to waive off farm loans.Other opposition leaders such as Deve Gowda of the Janata Dal (S), Sharad Yadav of Janata Dal (U) and the Nationalist Congress Party’s Sharad Pawar had also joined in. Those hopes are raised by the history of regimes in India pardoning loans for farmers, still the country’s largest vote bank. The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance waived agricultural loans of small and marginal farmers worth about Rs 50,000 crore in 2008. Before that the VP Singh government had written off farm loans. Some state governments like Tamil Nadu have also pleased farmers with repayment waivers.The primary income of a little over 30% of rural households in the country comes from farming, according to the Socio Economic and Caste Census, 2011. About a fifth of them are estimated to be in the Below Poverty Line (BPL) bracket.Demonetisation has raised a new worry for farmers and workers who receive state benefits because of their BPL status. Ravi Sehgal, senior vice-chairman, Engineering and Export Promotion Council of India, says the engineering industry has managed to convince about 60% of the labourers to accept cheques. The rest do not want money in their bank accounts because they may lose their BPL status. “They also do not want their families to find out how much they make (because they often spend it on alcohol and gambling),” he says.Managing the worries of BPL families could be a headache for the government. “We will have to face that problem next year,” a top government official told ET Magazine on condition of anonymity. The SECC 2011 measures poverty on seven different parameters of deprivation, including landlessness, homelessness and education levels. A government-appointed committee is working on ways to draw a new poverty line based on the SECC data and deprivation parameters.The official said poor people who receive government subsidies for building homes and toilets are worried whether their changed living conditions would push them out of the BPL bracket.The Centre’s drive to digitise financial transactions has added another wrinkle to that. The Centre is struggling to figure out what to do with the thousands of crores that were deposited in the Jan Dhan or no-frills accounts.Since Modi announced demonetisation on November 8, these accounts, opened under a government scheme to reach its doles to the unbanked poor, saw a 62% surge in deposits.The total deposits in the over 25 crore accounts jumped to Rs 74,321 crore on November 30, up Rs 28,685 crore from November 9. On November 8, the PM had said the demonetisation was aimed at tackling counterfeit notes and terrorism financing.However, that narrative has since changed to push economy-wide digitisation of financial transactions. RBI Governor Urjit Patel told a post-monetary policy press conference on December 7 that the push towards a cashless economy was a collateral benefit of demonetisation. However, indications are that there may be many collateral risks — political and economic — associated with demonetisation that may reveal over the next year.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/Demonetisation-has-created-unforeseen-worries-at-the-grassroots/articleshow/55916366.cms

Rage against liquor marketing arm TASMAC: Why cries for prohibition are getting louder in Tamil Nadu,[],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-45925383,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-144935,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2015-01-18T04:00:00,"When the word TASMAC (Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation) is uttered within earshot of 51-year-old Lakshmi Gunasekaran, she becomes almost apoplectic. A deep frown casts a shadow on her weary face and she spits with contempt. “Shut it down; shut them all down,” she says. “Does the government need such revenues by making women widows? Who asked for freebies? Did we?” she rages.The frail lady from Bodidasanpatti village in south Tamil Nadu’s Theni district is willing to shout her tale to anyone who will listen. “I will not keep quiet,” she says. “What has happened to my children should never happen to anyone else. And for that, I will keep talking,” she says.Lakshmi’s husband Gunasekaran died early, leaving her to care for their three daughters and a son. Working as a farm labourer, Lakshmi managed a tough life and was happy to see her daughters and son get married. “My husband never used to touch alcohol but fate intervened and ensured that all my three daughters married men who became drunkards,” she rues. “My son too has become an alcoholic. It is all because of TASMAC,” she says. “My third daughter’s husband asked her for money to buy booze. When she refused, he urinated in her rice and forced her to eat it,” she breaks down. “No one helped me; neither the police, nor my neighbours. My own daughter — my flesh and blood. Will any mother keep quiet on hearing this?” she cries.Lakshmi found solace in a small group of women who called themselves Tamil Maanila Pengal Iyakkam loosely translating to Tamil State Women’s Movement. Fuelled by her rage and that of others, Lakshmi and the group managed to shut down 20 TASMAC outlets five years ago in Theni. “What business does the government have running liquor shops?” asks Arunmozhi Velusamy, Theni district president of the Tamil State Women’s Movement. “The government says they get huge revenues from this. The money is being taken away from us — from the wives, the children, the parents. It is ruining our men and putting families on the streets,” she adds.Such cries for prohibition are getting louder in Tamil Nadu. Small groups and charities have mushroomed across the state in the past five years, all of them with one goal — to force politicians to impose prohibition. Public perception is that TASMAC revenues fund the freebies that the state is notorious for — colour TVs, mixies, grinders, fans and even gold. Although in reality the link between the two is tenuous, public anger is directed at the state over this.Gandhian activist Sasi Perumal conducts frequent hunger strikes demanding prohibition in the state. A group of youngsters calling themselves People’s Movements Against Liquor and Drugs (PMALD) walked across Tamil Nadu for 100 days spreading awareness on prohibition. “Kids in VIth and VIIth standards are buying liquor now,” says a disgusted Inamul Hasan, one of the founders of PMALD. “Only Prohibition can save us,” he adds.In November 2003, the then chief minister Jayalalithaa decided that the state would retail alcohol through TASMAC. Over 7,300 private shops retailing liquor were forcibly taken over by the state government. Revenues to the state exchequer shot up. Every year since then, revenues to the government through excise and sales tax have increased by 20% on an average, hitting a new high of Rs 21,641 crore in 2013-14. In 2014, prices of liquor were hiked twice in a bid to bring in more revenues. Sales dropped by about 4% for the first time in a decade, but revenues continued to clock an increase of 9%. The unofficial target for TASMAC is Rs 24,000 crore this year, say officials in the know.While ambitious revenue targets are being set and met, little attention has been paid to the consequences. A senior official in the health department, on condition of anonymity, told ET Magazine that the state government has no awareness programme on the ill effects of consuming alcohol. “We don’t have any such programme and there are no plans to introduce any either,” he says. “We have done awareness programmes about smoking, tobacco and breast cancer, but none on alcoholism,” he adds. In 2011-12, a series of radio advertisements were broadcasted by the state using World Bank funding. They spoke at length on the ill effects of obesity, diabetes and smoking. Alcoholism was conspicuous by its absence.“There are no proper studies on the prevalence of alcoholism but smaller studies show that 2.5% of society is suffering from serious alcoholism,” says Anand Khakhar, programme director for the Centre of Liver Disease and Transplantation, Apollo Hospitals, Chennai. “That is a huge number. 4.8% of the population in the country suffers from Hepatitis B, an alcoholrelated disease. In Tamil Nadu alone, it would be around 4.5%,” he says. Khakhar did 125 liver transplants last year, of which 35 were the result of alcohol-related problems. He endorses the idea of prohibition. “The state should not sell alcohol,” he argues. “The state selling alcohol is indirectly endorsing it. You sell liquor and then give a subsidy for liver transplants. That’s a no-brainer.”Lakshmi Vijayakumar, head of the psychiatry department at Chennai-based Voluntary Health Services, says the state spends at least two times more on health than the revenues received through liquor retailing. “The limited statistics that we do have are scary,” she says.“One in three accidents is alcohol-related. In India, the average drinking age has come down from 19 years to 13-14. About 10 years ago, alcoholics who came to me for treatment used to be in their 40s. Now, most of my patients are in the age group of 25-30. Of the people who consume liquor, only 15-20% drink in moderation; 80% fall into the hazardous drinkers category,” she adds. Vijayakumar says liquor should not be so easily available. Apart from the health aspect, the social impact — debt cycle, poverty, domestic violence and lack of productivity — is much more widespread and worrying.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/Rage-against-liquor-marketing-arm-TASMAC-Why-cries-for-prohibition-are-getting-louder-in-Tamil-Nadu/articleshow/45925106.cms

The public notice specified that the logo belonged to the airline and would be sold with other trademarks such as Fly Kingfisher, the logo of the Flying Bird Device and the word mark 'Fly the Good Times'.The logo and the name Kingfisher, associated with the popular brand, were also used by the airline company when Vijay Mallya pushed his group into aviation in 2007. The airline’s logo is slightly different from the beer logo but it is not very obvious and UB officials feel the scope for mischief is high in case the buyer happens to be a rival beer or alcohol manufacturer.UB Managing Director Shekhar Ramamurthy told ET that the Kingfisher mark belongs to United Breweries Limited. ""We also have exclusive rights to the Kingfisher trademark in a few other categories such as merchandising material, clothing, etc. The trademark that is being put up for sale by SBI (State Bank of India) is for the airline category only. Any prospective buyer cannot use it in any category where we have exclusive usage rights,"" he said.UB officials said the company is not responsible for or connected to any guarantees made by United Breweries Holdings owned by Mallya. ""The lenders need to do their homework before the public bids,"" another UB Group official said. ""They have to tell possible buyers what they can do with that logo and brand. We will legally challenge plans for any other category.""Bankers are not very enthused about the sale of the Kingfisher brand and trademark, which will go under the hammer on April 30 for a reserve price of Rs 366.7 crore.""We are not expecting any bids at the auction, but we have to follow the process,"" said a banker on the condition of anonymity. ""If we don’t put these intangible assets on the block there will be pressure from the Central Bureau of Investigation and Central Vigilance Commission alleging that we didn’t do our fullest to recover dues.""Sources also said that before Kingfisher Airlines went bellyup, banks had valued the brand and trademark at Rs 160 crore, but later an external agency had assigned a value of Rs 4,100 crore to the Kingfisher brand in 2011.The Kingfisher brand name was pledged to 14 lenders, including SBI, IDBI Bank , Punjab National Bank, Bank of India and Bank of Baroda under a debt recast agreement. Alpana Parida, president of brand consultancy DY Works, said while other airlines connote flying, travel or hospitality, Kingfisher Airlines stood for the 'king of good times'.""This essence allows the brand to stretch across multiple categories. The brand transcended a direct association with its now-beleaguered promoter... The promise of good times allows the brand to stretch and (it) can be even used to sell newer categories such as real estate and fashion,"" she said.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/Only-aviation-companies-can-fly-with-Kingfisher-logo-warns-United-Breweries/articleshow/51639288.cms

Can NREGS become more effective if treated as a business?,['Peter Arackal'],https://img.etimg.com/photo/65498029.cms,2010-04-05T11:34:00,"Can Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) be turned into a profitable business venture? Or, can Mumbai-based Party Hard Drivers (PHD), the first company in the country to specialise in providing drivers by night so that people do not drink and drive, be called “social business’’?As cathedrals of capitalism tottered on the brink of fiscal chaos following the Lehman collapse, high priests of socialism began pushing their ideology. Now, with the economy reviving, there are once again talks of fusion of the two “isms’’. There is a section of ideators that thinks several philanthropic efforts, if treated as “social business’’, can become profitable and have high welfare impact.“Social business’ ’ is a term used by Nobel laureate and maestro of microfinance Muhammad Yunus to describe a commercial activity where businesses whose primary goal is to help the targeted group plough their entire profits back into their work rather than give dividends to shareholders. According to Yunus, a social business enterprise is created not to maximise profits, but with a declared mission to maximise benefits to the people served, without incurring losses.It has become fashionable for some corporates to pontificate on corporate social responsibility (CSR), which social entrepreneurs call more of a PR exercise than a genuine effort to help the poor. As companies increase allocations for CSR activities and begin targeting the bottom of the pyramid, social business is gaining currency.While addressing industry leaders in Mumbai recently, Yunus, who pioneered microfinancing, said: “We, as humankind, have multidimensions: We have selfless parts and we have a self-centred part. Most of the businesses today are focused on the self-centred part. It is all about me, it is all about my. The social business is all about you. The objective of social business is not to maximise profit, but to get maximum social benefits.’’The founder of Bangladesh’s Grameen Bank also proposed setting up a separate stock exchange for the listing of social enterprises as one of the funding sources for such firms. “The social business is not charity as it can be run through raising funds from the stock market. In the Indian context, social business can be possible in a number of areas such as water, health, urban poverty, education and environment,’’ Yunus said.There are some takers for Yunus’s proposal. Says Nishith Desai, founder of Nishith Desai Associates, a Mumbai-based international law firm, “If Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), for example , becomes part of the social business venture, raising funds and scaling up operations will not be a problem for it and it will turn into a profitable enterprise.’’ Desai said AA, if structured as a social business enterprise, could offer services under three slabs: some free of cost, some at lower rates and others at significantly higher rates. The “customers’ ’ of AA —the relatives of the persons using the services of AA—could invest in AA even as their kin gets rid of alcoholism, thereby making it financially viable. Likewise , Party Hard Drivers , too, can scale up operations , as part of the social business model.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/Can-NREGS-become-more-effective-if-treated-as-a-business/articleshow/5762183.cms
A 3-star general explains why America lost the global war on terror,[],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-45451430,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-43953,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2014-12-10T13:27:00,"In this excerpt from Why We Lost: A General's Inside Account of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars, retired 3-star Army Lieutenant General Daniel Bolger, who led NATO training mission in Afghanistan from 2011 to 2013, describes the root cause of the military's failure in Iraq and Afghanistan. I am a United States Army general, and I lost the Global War on Terrorism.It's like Alcoholics Anonymous; step one is admitting you have a problem.Well, I have a problem.So do my peers.And thanks to our problem, now all of America has a problem, to wit: two lost campaigns and a war gone awry.We should have known this one was going to go bad when we couldn't even settle on a name. In the wake of the horrific al-Qaeda attacks on September 11, 2001, we tried out various labels.The guys in the Pentagon basement at first offered Operation Infinite Justice, which sounded fine, both almighty and righteous. Then various handwringers noted that it might upset the Muslims.These were presumably different kinds of followers of Islam than the nineteen zealots who had just slaughtered thousands of our fellow citizens. Well, better incoherent than insensitive, I guess.So we settled on Operation Enduring Freedom. Our efforts in Afghanistan certainly lived up to the ""enduring"" part, dragging out longer than the ten-year Trojan War as we desperately tried to impose ""freedom"" on surly Pashtuns.Still, that Enduring Freedom idea reflected the preferred brand. Few could have been much surprised when, in 2003, the next major campaign in the ill-named war drew the title Operation Iraqi Freedom.As in World War II, the Iraq intervention was seen, rightly, as yet another theater in what the military formally called the Global War on Terrorism. Like many veterans, I earned campaign ribbons with that designation.I lost eighty men and women under my charge; more than three times that number were wounded. Those sad losses are, all my fault. We waged a Global War on Terrorism against enemies referred to vaguely as terrorists, cowards, evildoers, and extremists. Although those descriptions were rather generic, somehow we always ended up going after the same old bunch of Islamists.Our opponents had no illusions about who our targets were, even if some of us did.This GWOT sputtered along for years, with me in it, along with many others much more capable, brave, and distinguished.I was never the overall commander in either Afghanistan or Iraq. You'd find me lower down on the food chain, but high enough.I commanded a one-star advisory team in Iraq in 2005-06, an Army division (about 20,000 soldiers) in Baghdad in 2009-10, and a three-star advisory organization in Afghanistan in 2011-13.I was present when key decisions were made, delayed, or avoided. I made, delayed, or avoided a few myself. I got out on the ground a lot with small units as we patrolled and raided.Then-Major General Daniel Bolger, commanding general,1st Cavalry Division, discusses the security situation near the Rashid District of southern Baghdad.Sometimes, I communed with the strategic-headquarters types in the morning and at sunset grubbed through a village with a rifle platoon.Now and then, Iraqi and Afghan insurgents tried to kill me. By the enemy's hand, abetted by my ignorance, my arrogance, and the inexorable fortunes of war, I lost eighty men and women under my charge; more than three times that number were wounded.Those sad losses are, to borrow the words of Robert E. Lee on that awful third day at Gettysburg, all my fault.What went wrong squandered the bravery, sweat, and blood of these fine Americans. Our primary failing in the war involved generalship. If you prefer the war-college lexicon, we - guys like me - demonstrated poor strategic and operational leadership.Soldiers from the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division rest while waiting to pack their weapons for shipment back to the United States at Camp Virginia on December 19, 2011.For soldiers, strategy and operational art translate to ""the big picture"" (your goal) and ""the plan"" (how you get there). We got both wrong, the latter more than the former.Some might blame the elected and appointed civilian leaders. There's enough fault to go around, and in this telling, the suits will get their share. But I know better, and so do the rest of the generals. We have been trained and educated all our lives on how to fight and win. This was our war to lose, and we did.Marine Lance Cpl. Blas Trevino, shouts out as he is rescued onto a medevac helicopter after he was shot in the stomach near Sangin, in the Helmand Province of southern Afghanistan, Saturday, June 11, 2011.We should have known better. In the military schools, like West Point, Fort Leavenworth, Quantico, and Carlisle Barracks, soldiers study the work of the great thinkers who have wrestled with winning wars across the ages. Along with Thucydides, Julius Caesar, and Carl von Clausewitz, the instructors introduce the ancient wisdom of Sun Tzu, the Chinese general and theorist who penned his poetic, elliptical, sometimes cryptic Art of War some twenty-three centuries ago.Master Sun put it simply: ""Know the enemy and know yourself; in a hundred battles you will never be in peril."" We failed on both counts. I know I sure did. As generals, we did not know our enemy - never pinned him down, never focused our efforts, and got all too good at making new opponents before we'd handled the old ones.Sgt. Tim Martin, an infantryman, shows evidence of the long journey after returning from Operation Buffalo Thunder II at Forward Operating Base Spin Boldak, Afghanistan, July 2, 2012.We then added to our troubles by misusing the US Armed Forces, which are designed, manned, and equipped for short, decisive, conventional conflict.Instead, certain of our tremendously able, disciplined troops, buoyed by dazzling early victories, we backed into not one but two long, indecisive counterinsurgent struggles ill suited to the nature of our forces.Time after time, despite the fact that I and my fellow generals saw it wasn't working, we failed to reconsider our basic assumptions.We failed to question our flawed understanding of our foe or ourselves. We simply asked for more time.Given enough months, then years, then decades - always just a few more, please - we trusted that our great men and women would pull it out. In the end, all the courage and skill in the world could not overcome ignorance and arrogance. As a general, I got it wrong. And I did so in the company of my peers.Excerpted from Why We Lost: A General's Inside Account of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars by Daniel Bolger.

Pay for your own drinks at board meetings : Finance ministry to state-run banks,['Dheeraj Tiwari'],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-28913135,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-19488,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2014-01-17T04:05:00,"NEW DELHI: Don't turn board meetings into junkets - this is the latest diktat from the finance ministry to state-run banks. Specifically, banks will have to stop footing the bill for any alcohol; board members will need to pay for their drinks themselves.The finance ministry circular is aimed at getting state-run banks, many of them groaning under an enormous pile of bad debt, to curtail wasteful expenditure.""It was observed that banks were bearing the expenditure of board members and sometimes even their guests, during the course of stay at the board meetings,"" said a finance ministry official, requesting anonymity. ""This is not acceptable and banks have been directed to take corrective action.""Banks shouldn't pay for the travel or accommodation of people accompanying board members. This restriction also applies to directors who are government nominees and independent directors, according to the circular. A bank typically holds around 10 board meetings in a fiscal year.Board committee meetings, such as those of the audit committee, amount to 15 or so annually. Banks have, in general, been careful about eschewing profligate spending.""Most banks follow these directives but there could have been some instances of deviance,"" said an executive director at a state-run bank. ""These directives should be viewed in light of the austerity measures which are in place.""The finance ministry had asked banks in 2012 to improve the structure and methodology of board meetings to make them more effective. However, a blanket ban could put some banks in a tough spot. There is a practice of hosting dinners at which alcohol is served before or after board meetings, some bank officials said.The latest advisory was welcomed by Mukesh Mohan, an independent director with Dena Bank . ""I think it is a welcome step, given the stress state-run banks are in,"" he said. ""I have personally stopped travelling business class as it is public money which is being spent."" In June 2013, state-run banks had total gross non-performing assets of Rs 1.92 lakh crore, 3.99% of gross advances, up from Rs 1.64 lakh crore in March.The government has also asked banks to avoid paying for extended stays and told them that board meetings need to be held at headquarters as far as possible, not at expensive holiday destinations.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/Pay-for-your-own-drinks-at-board-meetings-Finance-ministry-to-state-run-banks/articleshow/28912346.cms
Ravi Nedungadi: 'Money Man' in Vijay Mallya's Egoscape,[],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-51406462,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-83056,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2016-03-15T11:47:00,"BENGALURU: Ravi Nedungadi , the bean counter-in-chief of Vijay Mallya’s once sprawling business empire, resembles his boss. A goateed polyglot and a burly man with a deep-throated laugh. Last month, Nedungadi, 59, battling health worries, held his nerve as he spoke about his imminent retirement from the UB Group. The Bengaluru-headquartered UB Group’s president and chief financial officer for nearly two decades, he was busy with lawyers preparing for a long haul in the courts and before investigating agencies. Nedungadi said he wished to keep away from the media.Not so long ago, he was the face of Mallya’s fund-raising prowess. His success was in building a new narrative about Mallya among investors and in top banking circles. This was a tough act in the late 1990s after Mallya was practically written off as a serious industrialist. Nedungadi’s script slowly changed the perception and banks were soon betting on Mallya’s leveraged acquisition of Shaw Wallace & Co in 2004.Nedungadi had earned his spurs long ago, when he turned around Berger Paints, and listed it on multiple exchanges across the globe before selling it. The successful Shaw Wallace deal and a rather smooth deleveraging thereafter had revamped the Mallya persona. The markets, investors and bankers were playing along suddenly. Mallya, who famously said he never worried about share prices of his companies, turned serious about their market value. Mallya and Nedungadi were cruising on the leverage finance highway as they consolidated the group’s leadership interests in liquor and in beer. They picked up smaller brewers and distillers in hurried deals to prevent them from falling into the hands of MNC rivals. “Nedungadi was fully in charge of the group’s business diversification and funding arrangements. Rarely has Mallya depended on any professional like he did on him,” a former chief executive at one of the UB entities reminisced.Mallya’s ambitions soared as Nedungadi drove consolidation in the core alcoholic beverage businesses, improving capital efficiency and generating better cash flows. Mallya had always eyed an aviation foray but lacked the financial power. He ran an air-taxi operator under UB Air and was also part of an aviation venture for island hopping in Maldives in the 1990s. His rekindled ambition coincided with the liquidity boom of the last decade. In 2005, Nedungadi, like any diligent finance man, harboured doubts, but was soon on board Mallya’s flight of fancy.Nedungadi, like his boss, lived on a plane to show up with finances in those go-go years. Mallya’s plan to acquire a Scottish distillery took them to Whyte & Mackay in 2007. What followed was an expensive, fully leveraged acquisition at the height of booming scotch prices. Mallya needed scotch reserves to fend off MNCs who were invading his home turf. The acquisition strategy made sense, but not the price. Barely two months later, Nedungadi supported Mallya by shoring up financing for — what is now being described as bizarre — acquisition of low-cost airline Air Deccan. This was an overnight deal (trumping Anil Ambani’s offer) for a struggling airline.The global financial crisis, soaring oil price and a macabre management of Kingfisher Airlines strained the group’s finances. Nedungadi, one of the rare executives who spoke his mind to Mallya, only worked in delaying the inevitable. “He became part of Mallya’s ‘egoscape’, an extension of his personality. Maybe, it happens when you have travelled together for long,” one of the senior group executives said on the condition of anonymity. Nedungadi once dryly quipped about one of his biggest nightmares — Mallya and the media. “My chairman cannot keep quiet,” he had said. As Mallya takes to Twitter from an undisclosed location — this time to lambast the media — his trusted adviser must be hoping fervently that for a change he would keep quiet.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/Ravi-Nedungadi-Money-Man-in-Vijay-Mallyas-Egoscape/articleshow/51406370.cms
Correction begins with admission,['Vithal C Nadkarni'],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-5609827,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-2445,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2010-02-24T05:00:00,"Tiger Woods has now ‘rediscovered’ his childhood religion. The championgolfer , who faced censure for his alleged extra-marital liaisons, said he hoped to relearn the lesson of selfrestraint taught by Buddhism. His statement had been analysed “like a State of Union address even though the only union Tiger Woods addressed was his own” , a sympathetic columnist said, “( for) this was no voluntary conversion to an old religion. Rather , this was a forced one to the new Oprahite religion of emotional openness and making public one’s miseries and failings.”Newspersons who asked the Dalai Lama to comment discovered that the Tibetan spiritual leader was blissfully unaware of Tiger Woods’ travails, having somehow been uninformed of the golfer’s triumphs as well. When the matter was explained to him, the exiled Tibetan Buddhist extolled the importance of ‘self-discipline with awareness of consequences’ .The embattled golf champion himself said as much in his carefully scripted statement of apology: in recent years he had ‘drifted away’ from the Buddhist values of his upbringing which taught that “a craving for things outside ourselves causes unhappy and pointless search for security” .But would that satisfy the scolds berating Woods for letting his impulses get the better of him? As his former coach, Butch Harmon , said, “( They) want Woods to stand there in front of everybody , take his medicine, be humble , be embarrassed, be humiliated , and answer the questions.”His self-lacerating public apology could also be part of the famous 12-step plan for recovering from addictions, compulsions and other behavioural problems. The process starts with the admission that one is powerless against the demons of addiction and compulsion . One then moves on to admit “a greater power that can give strength” .One way of achieving this, as encoded by the next step, is by establishing cosmic connections: make a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understand Him, says the original Alcoholics Anonymous programme . In its summation, the Bhagavad Gita calls it the supreme secret of transcendence (psychologists might call it ‘transference’ ) which promises to empower the seeker to withstand most severe soul-crushing pressures .

"Diageo would take 30 years to build United Spirits' network: Samar Singh Sheikhawat, United Breweries",['Binoy Prabhakar'],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-17904251,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-30891,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2013-01-06T05:49:00,"The average price of a Kingfisher quart (large bottle) is Rs 100. Today, one can buy 100 things that cost Rs 100. A tube of Colgate Total — the largest one — is over Rs 100. Farm-fresh eggs today cost more than Rs 5, or Rs 60 for a dozen. Petrol is close to Rs 80 a litre. So in that context, for a discerning target audience, a Rs 100 price point is not the reason that they will not buy a Heineken.They will not buy because of the taste. In five-star hotels, no one questions prices because ambience, decor and hopefully service justify the pricing. But when a normal restaurant charges the same, a person will complain. In Heineken’s case, a customer pays for the best packaging, the most widely sold international premium mild beer brand and a huge history of 137 years. Our stated preference is to dominate all price points in all geographies.Well, I don’t know if they will bring Guinness. The spirits business is different from the beer business. We have no connection with the two. They all happen to be owned by the same business house. We do sponsorships together. Typically, their seasonality is totally different from ours. If our sales decline during the cold months, their consumption rises. The prices are different.Also, beer from the perspective of alcohol delivery is far more expensive than spirits. A bottle of whisky — a reasonably decent brand — will cost Rs 100 for 180 ml, which contains 40% pure alcohol. That is 72 ml of alcohol for Rs 100, or 1 rupee and 33 paise for 1 ml of alcohol. In beer, 650 ml of Kingfisher Premium contains 4% alcohol. That is 27 ml of alcohol for Rs 100 — exactly the opposite of spirits. In India, people drink to get smashed. No other reason. If that is the objective, it is far cheaper and far quicker to get a buzz on spirits than on beer. Which is why revenue-wise, the spirits business is much larger than the beer industry.Volume-wise, we (UBL) are actually slightly larger than USL — in 2011, we sold 135 million cases while they sold a little lesser. But our revenues were about Rs 3,500 crore compared with their Rs 8,000 crore because the unit price of a case of spirits is far higher than that of a case of beer. So a young boy starting to drink finds it far easier and cheaper to get smashed on a bottle of 180 ml of whisky than 650 ml of beer.I can’t comment. It is too early to tell what the product portfolio of Diageo will be or how the organisational structure will pan out.Have you tasted Guinness? My theory is that it will not work in India. First, it is served at room temperature. Second, it is black. Third, it has a fruity coffee kind of taste. Indians like their beer cold. The per capita consumption of beer today in India is 1.6 litres per person per year. That is next to nothing. Now where the beer market is so small and nascent, a niche beer will take 50 years to change the scenario.You have these microbreweries and beer clubs, which are all full but none is making money. There will be a couple of 1,000 people in every city who will like to drink specially brewed beer, but the overwhelming majority prefers regular beer. Haywards had launched Haywards Black, which was something like a stout. Bombed miserably.Not necessary. For instance, just hypothetically, what if it were decided that Guinness will be distributed through the UBL network? We don’t have a Guinness kind of product in our portfolio. If we believe that there is a market for it, the best way to market is through UBL and not USL.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/interviews/Diageo-would-take-30-years-to-build-United-Spirits-network-Samar-Singh-Sheikhawat-United-Breweries/articleshow/17904247.cms
Food ministry seeks delay in ethanol blending plan,['Prabha Jagannathan'],https://img.etimg.com/photo/65498029.cms,2011-05-24T03:04:00,"NEW DELHI: The food ministry is set to oppose the mandatory 5% ethanol blending programme, fearing diversion of foodgrain for manufacture of ethanol.The ministry has called for the report of the expert panel headed by Planning Commission member Saumitra Chaudhuri in order to ""review"" the programme.The petroleum ministry was expected to soon send the report to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs for a final decision after factoring in the dissent notes posted by some panel members, including sugar industry representatives.""Ethanol is a very sensitive issue and a shortfall in some years could not only impact other sectors but also compel diversion of foodgrain for its production, if prices shoot up due to shortage of molasses for the alcohol industry,"" a food ministry official told ET. ""We have to move very carefully on this subject,"" he said.The ministry is worried, as the government is likely to adopt the ambitious food security law proposed by the National Advisory Council.Even the Chaudhuri Committee, set up to suggest the pricing of ethanol for blending with fuel, has said in its interim report that enough ethanol may not be available for the blending programme. Five of eight members of the Chaudhuri panel had opposed the decision to go into the issue of sectoral allocation of ethanol, including to the ethanol blending programme.Both the alcohol and the chemicals industries back the report's position on ethanol shortage for the EBP, unless it is culled at the expense of other sectors.""The national biofuel policy forbids this. In the best sugarcane production year, the EBP's ethanol requirements are unlikely to be met,"" Indian Glycols CEO Rakesh Bhartia said.The sugar industry had also approached the prime minister saying the committee had exceeded its brief by going into the availability issue.Evidence seems to bear out the scarcity situation painted by the committee. By end-April, oil companies have been only secure about around 32% of the 100 crore litres of ethanol they need for the 5% blending norm despite the government approving an attractive interim price of around 27 a litre for ethanol.Tamil Nadu, which has a thriving alcohol industry which makes a large contribution to state revenue, has already banned ethanol supply to the ethanol blending programme, while Bihar is understood to have ""unofficially"" discouraged it.At present, assured supply of ethanol for blending is indicated only from Maharashtra, Sharad Pawar's home state, and Karnataka, home to one of the biggest sugar mills in the country.The petroleum and food ministries had been aggressively pushing ethanol blending, but the equation has changed after the reshuffle in the ministries.Pawar is out of the food ministry and Murli Deora has moved to corporate affairs. Minister of State K V Thomas now heads the food ministry, while the petroleum ministry now has Jaipal Reddy at its helm.A government official told ET on conditions on anonymity that the petroleum ministry was ""not aggressive"" on pushing through the EBP.Andhra Pradesh, which too earns substantial revenue from the alcohol industry, has warned the Centre over the plan. The state government has argued that if ethanol blending proves to be lucrative enough, shortage of molasses for the alcohol industry could lead to diversion of foodgrain for making alcohol.In China, rice wine is the general designation for all fermented drinks produced from cereals. It has an ethanol content of 15-16%.Sugar and corn are, though, the easiest, best known and most effective routes to ethanol production.""The government's perspective must be all inclusive and not just take a decision based on whether one industry is benefited or not,"" said a government official defending the Chaudhuri committee report.The sugar industry, however, has maintained consistently that it is in a position to supply the required quantity citing high sugar output. Earlier this year, though, it pegged down marginally, its sugar output estimate for the year.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/Food-ministry-seeks-delay-in-ethanol-blending-plan/articleshow/8543907.cms
How a web of corruption allows lucrative international red sanders smuggling: A smuggler's account,[],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-47399126,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-266589,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2015-05-24T11:06:00,"On an unusually cool afternoon in the posh Chetpet area of Chennai sits Raman (name changed on request), well into his ’60s, in his pajamas, whirling a cane in his hand as he talks about his lucrative profession — smuggling of red sanders trees. Raman opens up on the condition of anonymity. “Especially now is not a good time to talk openly of these things,” he says of his smuggling operation.He is referring to the alleged encounter deaths of 20 woodcutters from Tamil Nadu, shot down by the forest police force of Andhra Pradesh deep inside the Seshachalam forests. The encounter took place in the wee hours of April 7. A political uproar erupted with protests against Andhra police in the state of Tamil Nadu. Investigations are on into the alleged encounter with “unknown” Special Task Force police personnel being accused of murder.The Andhra Pradesh High Court , a Special Investigation Team set up by the Andhra government as well as India’s National Human Rights Commission are individually probing the issue.This was the bloodiest case of killings over red sanders, an endangered species of tree endemic to the forests along the Andhra Pradesh-Tamil Nadu border. Forest officials who tried to stop smuggling have been brutally murdered in the past as well.Red sanders is spread over 5,160 square km in Andhra, according to data available with the ministry of environment and forests. Red sanders, or red sandalwood, is a key ingredient in cosmetics and traditional medicines both in India and abroad. In China, the wood is used extensively for making furniture and musical instruments. In 2013-14 alone 42.32 tonnes of red sanders was seized by customs department officials in Tamil Nadu. Much more has been smuggled out of the country.Domestic demand and prices are low within India. “Locally, the going rate is now `40 lakh per tonne,” says Raman. “But when we export it, the rates double and we get `70-80 lakh per tonne.”""The Chinese believe red sanders has aphrodisiac qualities,” chuckles Raman. “They want cots made of this wood. The Japanese want traditional musical instruments like shamisen and koto made of it.”Raman speaks at length about the intricate web of corruption that allows this lucrative international red sanders smuggling to operate.“The buyers in China, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Japan get in touch with what we call suppliers in India, like myself,” he explains. “Suppliers are everywhere — in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Jaipur, Kannauj, Kolkata , Tirupati and Chitspecialtoor.An order is placed — for instance, 25 tonnes of red sanders logs. Each supplier has his own network in the Andhra-Tamil Nadu border area where the trees are available.He gets in touch with the agent in Tirupati and Chittoor in Andhra and gives him the order details,” he says. The agent in turn puts out the word to his network of sub-agents in villages dotting the Jawadhu hills in Tamil Nadu. A team of 100-200 men is assembled depending on the size of the order. These villagers, says Raman, are traditional woodcutters, the kind who died in the encounter in early April. These traditional woodcutters, who once took down sandalwood trees in the Sathyamangalam forests, were rendered jobless around 2004 with the police and special task force crackdown on notorious brigand Veerappan and others like him.“The sub-agents earn `1,000-2,000 to round up these men. The 100-200 woodcutters are paid `1,000 per head per trip. Each trip lasts about 15 days as they must go deep into the forests to cut down trees. They live in the forests during that time. It is like an army — out of 100 men, only about 20 will actually fell trees. The rest of them will be given precise roles — some will be look-outs to ensure no forest department officials arrive, some will guard against wild animals, some will cook while others will sharpen saws and tools,” says Raman.Food provisions are carried by the men into the forests. Deaths sometimes occur — woodcutters get attacked by wild elephants or get lost in the forests and perish due to dehydration. “In such cases, the supplier provides monetary compensation of `5 lakh to the family of the dead,” says Raman. “It is to wash away the sins accrued by that death.”Agents, usually local musclemen, earmark patches of forest, claiming it to be their territory. They charge `2000-3000 as fee for organising one trip. Forest department officials responsible for the respective areas, claims Raman, are usually on the take and have specified bribes per trip. “A beat officer, deputy ranger, watcher and a guard put together get bribed `40,000 per trip to turn a blind eye to the felling,” he says. Most points of ascension to the hills are through tiny villages at the foothills. Village leaders and elders are paid `1,000-2,000 per trip for permission to enter. The forest department officials refused to comment on the matter when contacted by ET Magazine.Once the requisite number of trees is felled, the woodcutters hoist the logs onto their shoulders and begin their descent. Where the plains get flatter, mules or bullock carts would await them and the logs are then taken to the closest motorable roads, which again lie within a village at the foothills. The village that they exit from is never the same as the village from which they entered. “The logs need to be hidden in the village, so villagers usually ask for `50-100 per log as protection money to keep quiet,” says Raman. “There are usually a number of local goons there who see an opportunity to demand money and alcoholThese are usually indulged so that they keep their silence.”The team leader of the woodcutters then heads to meet with the supplier’s employee in a small hotel or lodge. Logs remain hidden behind bushes on the roadside, awaiting trucks to pick them up. Another employee of the suppliers arrives with the truck and the logs are loaded and covered with watermelon, bananas or jackfruit in order to escape random police checks along the way. To reach the highway, these trucks have to cross a forest department checkpost — the agent would have already paid `1 lakh per truck as bribe to allow these out onto the highway. These trucks then head by road to the port of departure in Chennai, Mumbai or Kannauj,” says Raman.At the port itself sits an agent whom Raman calls the ‘port agent’. This is a man specialising in greasing palms, a one-point contact for smugglers to move their goods quietly through. “Port agents are paid `5 lakhs per tonne. A 40-foot container can hold 24 tonnes of goods. This amount includes bribes paid to customs officials at the port such as the customs officer, examiner, appraiser, container yard supervisor, container preventive officer etc. The package deal for all of these officials is `5 lakh per container and they split it amongst themselves as per hierarchy,” says Raman.If the containers are packed in a private warehouse, the law insists that a customs official must be present during the process of packing. “The suppliers’ men will ply the customs official with alcohol and show him only the goods used to camouflage the logs,” says Raman. “Some suppliers weld a sheet into the container, creating two partitions so that the logs can’t be easily seen. Sealed containers are often opened by removing the hinges on the door — the packed material is taken out and replaced with red sanders,” he chuckles.Once the consignment leaves Indian shores, the buyer’s network takes over at ports of transit in Dubai, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Hong Kong. Job done, the supplier in India makes a cool `2-5 crore for the entire operation.Raman says the suppliers are well known to the police and political establishment in each state but operations continue smoothly as top cops as well as political leaders are paid off to allow operations to continue. He refuses to disclose the figures involved.Andhra Pradesh minister for environment and forests B Gopala Krishna Reddy agrees that there is a problem of widespread corruption. “We need to take steps for a long-term solution,” says Reddy. “We are mulling removing the ban on felling and export of red sanders itself. If there is no smuggling, there can be no corruption,” he says.As the probe continues into the alleged encounter of 20 woodcutters, India would need to cast a much wider net in order to put an end to this international smuggling operation. Institutionalised corruption would need to be dealt with an iron hand.(The writer is a freelance journalist based in Chennai)",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/How-a-web-of-corruption-allows-lucrative-international-red-sanders-smuggling-A-smugglers-account/articleshow/47399063.cms

Pricing uncertainty forces Uttar Pradesh sugar mills to shut down,"['Shreya Jai', 'Manmohan Rai']","https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-26072728,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-44950,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2013-11-20T07:46:00,"NEW DELHI/LUCKNOW: The fate of Uttar Pradesh’s Rs 35,000-crore sugar industry, which is the sole and largest agriculture-based industry, hinges on one decision – the price of sugarcane. After rumours have been rife about no crushing season in the state, UP sugar mills have officially declared that the sugar industry of the state would stand non-operative till the Rangarajan formula is adopted to fix the cane price.The industry has also threatened that no further investments would be made in the sugar sector. In fact, sugar mills have posted notices on their units telling the farmers that they should look for alternatives to sell their cane crop as mills won’t be able to buy this sugar season.“It may kindly be appreciated that in case a viable and affordable sugarcane price is not declared by the government at the earliest in accordance with the paying capacity of the sugar mill(s) linked with the average sales realisation in accordance with the Rangarajan formula, we are not in a position…to commence the crushing operation of the sugar mills as being contemplated/directed and shall be constrained to proceed for suspension of operations of the units for the reason beyond our control as we cannot continue to bear and suffer the losses and operate the mills under financial crunch,” said the letter written by Indian Sugar Mills Association ( ISMA ) to the cane commissioner and chief minister, UP, reviewed by ET.Though the chief minister is likely to send the state-advised price of cane to the Cabinet on November 25, things have already turned sour for the sugar industry and cane farmers.Typically, governments in UP have favoured farmers when it comes to deciding the cane price, with the intention of garnering their votes. Also, given the steep increases that previous chief minister Mayawati had implemented in cane price (SAP), Akhilesh Yadav would feel constrained to do so. State authorities indicated that cane price this season also would depend largely on the escalation in the input cost for farmers over the years. “Cost of agri-inputs, fertilisers and fuel has shot up substantially and farmers need to be compensated for it,” said Rahul Bhatnagar, UP principal secretary, sugar industry and cane development.Requesting anonymity, a senior official at the cane development department, UP told ET the cane price is likely to go beyond Rs 300 per quintal this year. Adopting the Rangarajan formula would mean a base cane price of Rs 225 per quintal, with prices comparable to sugar and its by-products -- ethanol, industrial alcohol, molasses and bagasse. The tiff is playing havoc for the industry and farmers alike. “At the current price of cane, soon there would be no buyers for UP’s sugarcane. Farmers would either succumb to sell their cane to gur manufacturers at almost half the price or let their crop perish,” said Abinash Verma, director general, Indian Sugar Mills Association.Meanwhile, the government refuses to budge. “We have been telling the industry that the state government can never lower the cane price over the past year,” said Bhatnagar. He also ruled out any possibility of such consideration this year during the cane price fixing procedure and state government extending any subsidy to millers for paying off the cane arrears. With no new orders in hand, farmers haven’t started harvesting the cane. Agitation, arrests and sealing of sugar godowns are already happening in areas in and around sugar mills. Farmers’ groups of the state have quoted cane price as high as Rs 372 per quintal.“Based on Rangarajan’s recommendation and an increase of input cost of farmers and profit margin of about 20% each, the cane price for the upcoming season comes to Rs 372/quintal,” said Prof Sudhir Panwar, President of Kisan Jagrati Manch. However, for state authorities, the situation still isn’t as grim as hyped up by the mills. “This is a pure economic phenomenon. Sugar price is a cyclical problem. Just because this year the price is low, we cannot incur permanent damage over the farmers in terms of low cane prices. Prices will correct in future and so would the condition of the state’s sugar industry,” said Bhatnagar.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/Pricing-uncertainty-forces-Uttar-Pradesh-sugar-mills-to-shut-down/articleshow/26072561.cms
Kishore Chhabria joins fray for 50% rights of disputed brandy brand Mansion House,"['Arijit Barman', 'Sagar Malviya']","https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-40626548,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-38880,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2014-08-22T04:00:00,"MUMBAI: Veteran warhorse Kishore Chhabria is back to being his pugnacious best.The man who fought epic legal battles with his brother Manu and later with Vijay Mallya over ownership of liquor companies Shaw Wallace and Herbertsons, has joined the battle against Tilaknagar Industries over Mansion House, a popular brandy brand.On a high after becoming the biggest Indian spirits tycoon, Chhabria controlled Allied Blenders & Distillers (ABD) has struck a deal with Dutch distiller Herman Jansen to acquire rights over the Mansion House brandy trademark for India and South Asian for an undisclosed sum. At a press conference in Mumbai ABD’s CEO Deepak Roy said the company has acquired 50% of the brand rights. Even though he did not elaborate on the financial details, sources said the brand has been valued at around Rs 220 crore. So Chhabria is likely to pay out half that sum over a period of time.But this move will now pit him against Amit Dahanukar led Tilaknagar Industries, the country’s 5th largest distiller, which is already embroiled in a long-running dispute with the Dutch family owned company over the ownership of the popular brandy brand.What makes the confrontation more heady is the fact that Chhabria had in the recent past made an unsolicited offer to buy out Mansion House and other brands of Tilaknagar, only to be rebuffed. The move had at least temporarily tripped Dahanukar’s fund raising plans after Tilaknagar mandated domestic investment bankers to raise equity.Tilaknagar, burdened with Rs 743 crore debt (as on FY ’14) and various other corporate governance allegations, has an ambitious plan to ramp up sales. It reported Rs 616 crore revenues with a net profit of Rs 49 crore last fiscal.""The assignment of the trademarks (Mansion House and Savoy Club) during pendency of judicial proceedings is illegal. Neither the assignors (Herman Jansen) nor the assignee (ABD) are entitled to use the trademarks Mansion House and Savoy Club as it would tantamount to violation of TI's rights in the trademarks. It has also been upheld by the Bombay High Court,"" said Amit Dahanukar, the promoter of Tilaknagar.By putting his weight behind Jensen, alcohol industry watchers see this as a vintage Chhabria move to up the ante against Dahnukar, forcing him to sell.""So far Mansion House has not been fully exploited in India. With our marketing prowess and distribution strength, we will be able to unlock the true potential of the brand,"" said Deepak Roy, Executive Vice Chairman & CEO, ABD. ""We have studied the case very carefully and have been advised in favour of it,"" he added.""This is the only market where we have struck a brand related JV. India is unique and to have a partner always helps, said L.W. De Jong, VP, Export & Business Development, Herman Jansen Beverage Group B.V.With sales of 4.9 million cases last calendar, Mansion House is the second biggest selling domestic brandy and the mainstay for BSE-listed Tilaknagar. United Spirit's McDowell's No. 1 is the top selling brandy in the country with sales of 9.2 million cases as of December last year. Brandy is the 2nd largest category contributing 25% to the Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL) industry and is among the fastest growing category in the last few years.""We are still open to acquiring the brands and assets of Tilaknagar.

"Polls to boost liquor, sports utility vehicles & FMCG sectors",['Vijay Gurav'],https://img.etimg.com/photo/65498029.cms,2009-03-13T04:44:00,"MUMBAI: The spin-off effects of poll spending and post-election revelry could help businesses like liquor, auto and FMCG. Money spent in country-wide campaigns and large cash dealings may lead to a surge in demand for a while in these sectors.Political parties receive donations running into hundreds of crores from industrialists and builders who may be disclosing a fraction of what they actually dole out. This money moves around the cash economy during the weeks before the poll and also boil over into post-poll spending.As a large number of party workers and prospective voters participate in campaigning, cash is spent in a way that keeps the morale high. ���Sale of alcohol shoots up during elections. With increase in money supply, especially in rural areas, demand for personal care products are also likely to go up,��� said Edelweiss Securities in its report ���India Election Watch��� .Auto sales are also expected to improve as there will be more demand for vehicles, particularly special utility vehicles (SUVs), for election campaigns, personal transportation and security of politicians, said the report.Everyone is not so optimistic. Analysts feel that political spending may be subdued this time, given unfavourable market conditions. ���Flow of money in this year���s elections may not be strong because of the sluggish economic scenario and crash in the property prices,��� said Ambareesh Baliga, vice-president , Karvy Stock Broking. But he felt that demand for two-wheelers , SUVs and FMCG goods will rise ��� the extent of which would depend on the kind of money that various parties are willing to splurge.Since any change in demand outlook for these select sectors would be short term in nature, it would not significantly market sentiment. ���Investors would be more concerned about the long term prospects of the industry as a whole, which is currently reeling under domestic and global economic blues. Any short term trigger would not help much in regaining investor confidence,��� said an analyst on condition of anonymity. Political parties are currently sorting out differences with key allies and issues relating to seat sharing in different states.These pre-poll issues have apparently led to concerns in the market over the fate of Congress-led UPA and BJP-led NDA.

UB to benefit from Andhra Pradesh's new beer policy,['Sarah Jacob'],https://img.etimg.com/photo/65498029.cms,2010-07-08T01:37:00,"BANGALORE: The new procurement policy for sale of beer in Andhra Pradesh, the largest beer market in the country, will be based on the market share held by brewers in other states. This development is likely to benefit United Breweries while reducing the share of orders for the state’s largest selling beer marketer, SABMiller.South African beer giant SABMiller and United Breweries (UB) together account for 95% of Andhra Pradesh’s beer sales. The Andhra Pradesh Beverage Corporation (APBCL) will now reduce the share of this “duopoly” to 75% and reserve the remainder for smaller players. This follows the decision by the Andhra Pradesh High Court on Monday not to grant a stay on the new policy. SABMiller’s Indian subsidiary had appealed against the nodal state agency APBCL’s new procurement policy for beer on dated May 19, 2010.“It will take at least two-three days to arrive at the actual split between the two majors, but UB is likely to have an edge over SABMiller because of the market share they hold in other states,” said a senior APBCL official, on grounds of anonymity.The new policy is based on market share statistics of brewers across India. It is designed to open doors for other suppliers and to deliver wider consumer choice. APBCL has looked at states such as Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh for reference as these states also control the wholesale and retail trade of alcoholic beverages. SABMiller, the makers of Royal Challenge and Knock-Out beer, holds around 60% market in Andhra Pradesh, and draws 30% of its India volumes from the state. Order books had so far been awarded on the back of market forces or core consumer franchise for beer brands.“No corporation uses other states as a benchmark but they base it on local demand. Although the orders placed with SABMiller in the state will come down in the short run, it remains to be seen whether consumer demand will translate into higher sales for other brewers or if their stocks will stay blocked in warehouses,” said Sundeep Kumar, director corporate affairs and communications for SABMiller India.“This is definitely a positive for United Breweries but we have to wait and see how it will be implemented. It will then take at least 2-3 months to impact volumes,” said Shekhar Ramamurthy, deputy president UB.Industry observers, however, said that many brewers have regional brands that are only retailed in certain markets and would not be reflected in the market share of other states.Incidentally, United Breweries and SABMiller had locked horns with APBCL demanding a price increase last year. Taken aback by the move during peak summer months, APBCL blocked their supplies for nearly three months. They were finally granted a 9-10% price increase in November. Smaller brewers, such as Carlsberg India and Crown Beers India, who met consumer’s demand in this period, are those who are also likely to benefit from the policy revision.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/liquor/UB-to-benefit-from-Andhra-Pradeshs-new-beer-policy/articleshow/6140804.cms
"India wins WTO wine, spirits dispute vs US: Officials",[],https://img.etimg.com/photo/65498029.cms,2008-02-06T22:20:00,"GENEVA: The World Trade Organization has rejected a U.S. complaint that Indian import duties unfairly discriminate against products such as Napa Valley wine and Jack Daniel's whisky, officials said on Wednesday.But the decision is not a massive loss for the United States because the Indian government already lifted some of the massive taxes it imposes on foreign wine and spirits last year, bending to heavy pressure from the United States and Europe.While Brussels dropped its WTO complaint as a result, Washington continued to press its case.A WTO investigative panel ruled this week that India had not acted inconsistently with its WTO obligations, trade officials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the decision has not been made public yet.The U.S. and the 27-nation EU brought their complaints to the global trade referee last year, demanding a level playing field for their exports.India's basic import duties on wine were 100 percent, while the tariff on spirits was 150 percent, both within WTO limits. However, various government surcharges took the tariffs up to levels reaching as high as 550 percent, depending on the Indian state. The state of Tamil Nadu went furthest, shutting out foreign alcohol and allowing shops to sell only Indian-made spirits and wines.In July, India announced that it would revoke the additional duties it charged on wine and spirits, winning praise from the EU but a more measured response from Washington. At the same, Delhi said it would raise its basic duty on wines to 150 percent from 100 percent, which was still within the country's WTO limits.India is one of the world's largest markets for alcohol with a huge potential to grow, but imports account for a meager share in total consumption. Brussels and Washington argued that the tariffs represented unfair trade barriers keeping foreign countries from competing in India's market.The U.S., the EU and Japan, by contrast, allow nearly all spirits to enter their markets duty-free. China tacks only a 10-percent charge on foreign liquor.The U.S. says wine sales in India through special duty-free rules, such as at airports and luxury hotels, grew by 350 percent between 2000 and 2005. The growth was 200 percent for American liquors.But the total volume of U.S. exports remained low because of the high import duties. The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States estimates that all foreign liquors together account for less than 1 percent of the Indian market.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/India-wins-WTO-wine-spirits-dispute-vs-US-Officials/articleshow/2762464.cms
Govt overrules Pawar on ethanol,"['Nidhi Nath Srinivas', 'Rajeev Jayaswal']",https://img.etimg.com/photo/65498029.cms,2010-02-25T03:03:00,"NEW DELHI: A government plan to buy ethanol for blending with petrol at a price of Rs 27 per litre may be limited to six months, although agriculture minister Sharad Pawar has asked the price to be frozen for the next three years in line with the demand by sugar mills.Mr Pawar’s plan had faced resistance from the ministries of petroleum and finance that believe ethanol prices may drop next year. The Cabinet is expected to take the final decision soon.Oil marketing companies buy ethanol at a fixed price from local sugar companies for a 95:5 mix with petrol for retailing. For the last three years, they have been buying ethanol for Rs 21.50/litre. This contract ended on October 31, 2009 and is therefore, now up for re-negotiation between the government and mills.The sugar industry has collectively quoted a price of Rs 27/l for the new contract and would like this price to be locked for the next three years to remove uncertainty in revenue.But the ministries of oil and finance are in favour of re-negotiating the price after six months to keep it in line with the spot market. India allows duty-free import of ethanol, making it necessary for sugar mills to remain on a par with imported ethanol from chief rival Brazil.“Globally, there has been a correction in all commodities in the last 10 days as tighter US interest rates suck out liquidity from the markets. Ethanol and sugar prices have dropped accordingly. But this is just the start of this new interest rate cycle. We will see further correction in prices ahead,” said a market watcher.The other reason for their reluctance to fix a price for three years is the promise of better sugar cane production both in India and Brazil in the forthcoming summer. In India, a bigger cane crop would mean greater production of the by-product molasses from which mills produce ethanol. In Brazil, mills use cane juice to directly produce ethanol. Bigger cane Brazilian output is certain to reduce ethanol prices in the world market.Moreover, global ethanol prices also move in tandem with crude oil prices since ethanol can replace petrol in Brazil’s flex fuel cars. Crude oil has been hovering at around $80 barrel and is unlikely to spurt significantly higher over the next one year.That should keep ethanol affordable too, say market analysts. According to the World Bank, real prices of crude oil are projected to average $75/bbl (in 2009 dollars) in 2010, with nominal prices rising from $62/bbl in 2009 to $80/bbl in 2020.“Sugar companies obviously realise that ethanol prices could drop. That is why they would like the government to fix a high price for a fairly long time,” said an analyst seeking anonymity.Oil marketing companies floated a fresh tender for a one-year period from November 1, in which they stipulated that mills supply a minimum 90% of the purchase order quantity. If they default, they would be required to pay 10% of the basic rate for the undelivered quantities. Oil marketing companies have been customers of last resort for sugar mills who sold their ethanol to the potable and industrial alcohol industry because they paid much more than Rs 21.50/l.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/Govt-overrules-Pawar-on-ethanol/articleshow/5613689.cms

The group has already formed a j oint venture with leading hospital group Apollo Hospitals to enter the hospital segment while it���s close to picking up a controlling stake in Kerala Ayurvedic Health Spa, a leading ayurvedic therapy firm in south India. Birla Wellness would also form a joint venture with a leading Singapore-based health and wellness firm to bring high-end health and wellness products and programmes to the Indian market, sources close to development said.Last year, the Yash Birla group had undertaken a restructuring programme to streamline its operations. It had then identified health and wellness as a new growth area and roped in consultancy firm Ernst and Young (E&Y) to outline a business plan. Currently, the group is operating in engineering, auto component, textile and power equipment segments.When contacted group chairman Yash Birla said, ���Health and wellness is a burgeoning market in India. The group has identified it as a growth area. We have already formed a JV with Apollo Hospital to set up 200-bed hospital in Thane in Mumbai.��� He was, however, reluctant to divulge details on the Singapore deal and buying the Kerala spa.Currently, the Indian health and wellness market, estimated at Rs 2,000 crore, is on a boom with a year-on-year growth of over 25%. According to analysts tracking the sector, the attitude and preferences of the Indian consumers are changing due to a rise in their disposable incomes, high consumption propensity and exposure to global trends.���This has led to an increase in demand for health and wellness products and services.

How political parties try to get past EC guidelines to fish for votes,['Abheek Barman'],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-7854128,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-25147,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2011-04-03T02:33:00,"One of the pioneers of Tamil Nadu’s cash-for-votes politics is MK Alagiri, Central minister from the southern part of the state, whose first experiment with this model in the assembly seat of Thirumangalam five years ago was a big hit. Now revealed as a Wikileak, the DMK allegedly passed around Rs 5,000 to every voter before elections, via the newspaper delivery boys.With 2 lakh voters in an average Tamil Nadu assembly seat, victory at Thirumangalam could have cost a staggering `100 crore. It also established a new paradigm in Tamil politics: “the Thirumangalam model”. This was later used in the 2009 national elections with telling effect.In Chennai, reporters asked Quraishi if these elections too would follow the Thirumangalam model. “No,” he shot back, “they’ll follow the Election Commission model.” That’s easier said than done. As the EC ratchets up enforcement, parties and candidates dream up ever more ingenuous ways to dodge it. Ambulances, the last vehicle likely to be stopped, are used to ferry cash. In Tamil Nadu, extra compartments in water and milk tankers are filled with alcohol, which travels the last mile to voters’ homes in the inner tubes of bicycle tyres.In Tamil Nadu, EC observers got curious when they suddenly noticed a rash of wedding parties in several areas. Closer investigation showed that there was no bride or groom. Under the guise of a wedding celebration, candidates had organised feasts for voters. In some parties, guests sitting down to dinner can expect to find envelopes of cash tucked under their banana leaf thalis.Assam is among the cheaper states to fight elections in, especially on the upper reaches of the river Brahmaputra. Costs shoot up in more densely populated lower Assam. But visiting EC teams were surprised with the amount of money in the system, originating from well-heeled businessmen and the tea industry which has done well in the last three years. The EC has always said the two parties that play by the rules of the game are the CPM and the CPI.“We always go by the EC’s guidelines while running our campaigns. This time, it has asked all political parties to carry out their expenditure through bank transactions and we’re trying to do that,” says Biprendu Chakraborty, the CPM candidate for the Durgapur West assembly seat. That’s probably one reason why spending is relatively low key in Bengal.Trinamool’s Madan Mitra, who’ll contest Kamarhati, says, “I’ll try to go by the EC’s guideline and my personal expenditure won’t go beyond the amount fixed by it.” But he adds, “It’ll be very difficult to run a campaign with such a small amount of money.”",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/How-political-parties-try-to-get-past-EC-guidelines-to-fish-for-votes/articleshow/7854123.cms

McDowell's No.1 Platinum advertisement featuring MS Dhoni takes a dig at Royal Stag,"['Sagar Malviya', 'Sarah Jacob']","https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-8968999,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-20612,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2011-06-24T00:34:00,"MUMBAI | BANGALORE: Has ace spinner Harbhajan Singh made it large with Royal Stag United Spirits has got his captain MS Dhoni to say what matters is being different.In a rare case of a spoof in surrogate advertising, Vijay Mallya’s United Spirits has issued a commercial for McDowell’s No. 1 Platinum, which is a spoof on an advertisement for Seagram’s Royal Stag, Pernod Ricard’s largest-selling whisky in India.The Royal Stag ad shows the Indian spinner opting to not work in his father’s ball bearing factory and focus on cricket instead. At the end, he asks the viewer if with his achievements he has “made it large” in life. Taking a dig at the commercial and Royal Stag’s tagline ‘Make it large’, the McDowell’s No. 1 Platinum commercial shows a Bhajji look-alike making ball bearings the size of gym balls at his father’s factory, asking if he had “made it large”, only to get slapped by his father for being incompetent. Then it shows Dhoni saying, “Zindagi main kuch karna hai to large chodo, kuch alag karo yaar.”Liquor brands are not allowed to advertise in India. And both the mentioned commercials are ostensibly for Royal Stag cricket gear and McDowell’s No. 1 Platinum soda.Such surrogate advertising is common in a country where the alcohol consumption is growing rapidly as it becomes socially more acceptable and people prefer more expensive brands as their incomes rise. The Indian liquor market grew 16.1% to 234.4 million cases (of nine litres each) in 2010.The country’s ad industry has also seen several spoofs over the years, including Pepsi versus Coca-Cola, Rin versus Tide and Kingfisher versus Jet Airways. But spoof in a surrogate advertisement is complicated, say experts.“It’s a multilayer concept, that too in a surrogate advertising; any spoof will further complicate the communications,” said Draftfcb Ulka CEO Ambi Parameswaran. “It’s more driven by brand rivalry and competition among marketing teams.”DIRECT COMPETITIONMcDowell’s No.1 Platinum whisky, launched last year April, is priced exactly at the same rate as Royal Stag. Its sales have crossed one million cases within a year. Royal Stag, French distiller Pernod Ricard’s locally made blended whisky launched in 1995, sold 11 million cases last calendar. Clearly, United Spirits wants to drink into the Royal Stag market with McDowell’s No.1 Platinum.But its spoof has not gone down well with everybody. “It is in bad taste, this type of advertising has never been used in the Indian liquor industry,” an industry official said, seeking anonymity. An email questionnaire sent to Pernod Ricard , makers of Chivas Regal whisky and Absolut vodka, remained unanswered. United Spirits executives too could not be reached.Pernod Ricard has not yet lodged a complaint with the Advertising Standards Council of India, the self-regulatory advertising watchdog, which dealt with a complaint every alternate day last year.Interestingly, Dhoni’s advertising assault is on a brand that he endorsed until July 2010. Dhoni, along with teammate Yuvraj Singh, was signed on to endorse Royal Stag in 2006. Harbhajan Singh has been endorsing the brand since 2003.Dhoni was signed up for a three-year endorsement deal for McDowell's No. 1 Platinum in January for Rs 26 crore in one of the highest deals for a sportsperson at the time.Bobby Pawar, chief creative officer of Mudra Group, the advertising agency that handles McDowell, said the dig at ‘Make it large’ is to say that not everything needs to be large and that a tit-for-tat reaction from Pernod Ricard is welcome.“It's a very competitive market and even they are welcome to have a go at us. At the end, if two brands are having a difference of opinion in open, it's the end users who stand to gain,” he said.WHEN SPOOFS WORKFuture Brands CEO and advertising veteran Santosh Desai, however, feels the impact of the commercial will be limited. “It (the commercial) will surely create some short-term interest, but this (spoof) works best when there is a bi-polar market which is not the case here,” he said.Some industry watchers say McDowell’s No. 1 Platinum had made a veiled attack on Royal Stag’s Harbhajan Singh earlier as well. A commercial aired after the T20 World Cup referred to how experts would have asked Dhoni to go with a lead spinner with more than 200 international wickets in the last over of the final, but he had other ideas.Global cola giants Coca-Cola and PepsiCo were the ones that introduced the concept of spoofs and pot-shot advertising to Indian viewers. During the 1996 cricket World Cup, played in the subcontinent, Coca-Cola had spent more than $4 million for the rights to be the official sponsor. But Pepsi came out with a cheeky and popular TV spot saying ‘Nothing official about it’.Since then, both the cola firms have been flooding the television space with cheeky ads and at times, counter pot shots too. But apart from cola ad wars, several companies in the last two years have been increasingly getting involved in such spoofs.For instance, GlaxoSmithKline’s Horlicks spoofed Heinz’s Complan in a campaign where it almost showed the product shot of the Complan brand.Even in HUL’s Rin TV commercial, archrival P&G’s Tide Natural was prominently displayed along with the voiceover “Tide se kahin behtar safedi de Rin” (Rin washes much whiter than Tide).Ditto, in the case of Paras Pharma’s Set Wet Zatak that spoofed HUL’s Axe deodorant by showing a thin, bare-bodied man swinging two axes around himself, in manner of wearing a deodorant. Most of these cases were taken to the advertising watchdog.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/advertising/McDowells-No-1-Platinum-advertisement-featuring-MS-Dhoni-takes-a-dig-at-Royal-Stag/articleshow/8968977.cms

As their website explains: An official government figure for total tax collections is divided by the nation's (USA’s) total income.In 2010, in the US, taxes amounted to 26.89%of the American's income, which represents the stretch of 99 days from January 1 to April 9 of the year. Thus, last year, Americans celebrated the Tax Freedom Day on April 9. Americans worked well over three months of the year, from January 1 to April 9, before they earned enough to clear this year’s tax obligations at the federal, state and local levels.We decided to be different and decipher how much of taxes Amar, Akbar and Anthony have paid to the government during the financial year 2010-11 (of course, the income tax return will be filed by July-end) and what’s left for them? True, taxes are the price we pay for civilization, as has been well put by American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. But at the end of the day, it doesn’t harm us to ask: What’s in it for me?Rs 3,01,500Rs 26,154Amar is your typical next door youngster. Holding his first job in Mumbai, he often misses his mother's home cooked food. But well, the freedom, including the ability to smoke freely perhaps more than makes up for it. Living in Mumbai has taught him a thing or two, including the dignity that a job brings, so what if it is a call centre job with its graveyard time shifts. A few years later, he shall study further, perhaps do an MBA. Right now, he is content with learning the ropes and aspires to be a team leader in his organization, next year.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/Do-you-know-how-much-of-your-money-goes-into-indirect-taxes/articleshow/7520568.cms
Yash Birla to enter domestic health & wellness market,['Rajesh Unnikrishnan'],https://img.etimg.com/photo/65498029.cms,2008-04-14T01:40:00,"MUMBAI: The Rs 3,000-crore Yash Birla group has decided to enter the domestic health and wellness market through a new company, Birla Wellness.In the initial phase, the group would invest Rs 300 crore in the new segment. The group has already formed a j oint venture with leading hospital group Apollo Hospitals to enter the hospital segment while it���s close to picking up a controlling stake in Kerala Ayurvedic Health Spa, a leading ayurvedic therapy firm in south India. Birla Wellness would also form a joint venture with a leading Singapore-based health and wellness firm to bring high-end health and wellness products and programmes to the Indian market, sources close to development said.Last year, the Yash Birla group had undertaken a restructuring programme to streamline its operations. It had then identified health and wellness as a new growth area and roped in consultancy firm Ernst and Young (E&Y) to outline a business plan. Currently, the group is operating in engineering, auto component, textile and power equipment segments.When contacted group chairman Yash Birla said, ���Health and wellness is a burgeoning market in India. The group has identified it as a growth area. We have already formed a JV with Apollo Hospital to set up 200-bed hospital in Thane in Mumbai.��� He was, however, reluctant to divulge details on the Singapore deal and buying the Kerala spa.Currently, the Indian health and wellness market, estimated at Rs 2,000 crore, is on a boom with a year-on-year growth of over 25%. According to analysts tracking the sector, the attitude and preferences of the Indian consumers are changing due to a rise in their disposable incomes, high consumption propensity and exposure to global trends.���This has led to an increase in demand for health and wellness products and services. The retailing boom in India has also contributed to the growth of the entire wellness industry,��� said an analyst with E&Y who requested anonymity.Big retail firms are offering wellness products such as medical and nutritional products, fitness equipment, consultation, eye testing, books, and audio video material on health and wellness under one roof. In fact, Yash Birla is not the only group eyeing the booming health and wellness sector. Others like Manipal Group and Dabur India have already entered the market with grand plans for the future.According to Mr Birla, the group is also expanding its hospitals in Nashik and Pilani in Rajasthan while it would set up a over 14 spas across the country by the first quarter of next financial year under the name of new JV company.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/healthcare/Yash-Birla-to-enter-domestic-health-wellness-market/articleshow/2949649.cms
How political parties try to get past EC guidelines to fish for votes,['Abheek Barman'],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-7854128,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-25147,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2011-04-03T02:33:00,"One of the pioneers of Tamil Nadu’s cash-for-votes politics is MK Alagiri, Central minister from the southern part of the state, whose first experiment with this model in the assembly seat of Thirumangalam five years ago was a big hit. Now revealed as a Wikileak, the DMK allegedly passed around Rs 5,000 to every voter before elections, via the newspaper delivery boys.With 2 lakh voters in an average Tamil Nadu assembly seat, victory at Thirumangalam could have cost a staggering `100 crore. It also established a new paradigm in Tamil politics: “the Thirumangalam model”. This was later used in the 2009 national elections with telling effect.In Chennai, reporters asked Quraishi if these elections too would follow the Thirumangalam model. “No,” he shot back, “they’ll follow the Election Commission model.” That’s easier said than done. As the EC ratchets up enforcement, parties and candidates dream up ever more ingenuous ways to dodge it. Ambulances, the last vehicle likely to be stopped, are used to ferry cash. In Tamil Nadu, extra compartments in water and milk tankers are filled with alcohol, which travels the last mile to voters’ homes in the inner tubes of bicycle tyres.In Tamil Nadu, EC observers got curious when they suddenly noticed a rash of wedding parties in several areas. Closer investigation showed that there was no bride or groom. Under the guise of a wedding celebration, candidates had organised feasts for voters. In some parties, guests sitting down to dinner can expect to find envelopes of cash tucked under their banana leaf thalis.Assam is among the cheaper states to fight elections in, especially on the upper reaches of the river Brahmaputra. Costs shoot up in more densely populated lower Assam. But visiting EC teams were surprised with the amount of money in the system, originating from well-heeled businessmen and the tea industry which has done well in the last three years. The EC has always said the two parties that play by the rules of the game are the CPM and the CPI.“We always go by the EC’s guidelines while running our campaigns. This time, it has asked all political parties to carry out their expenditure through bank transactions and we’re trying to do that,” says Biprendu Chakraborty, the CPM candidate for the Durgapur West assembly seat. That’s probably one reason why spending is relatively low key in Bengal.Trinamool’s Madan Mitra, who’ll contest Kamarhati, says, “I’ll try to go by the EC’s guideline and my personal expenditure won’t go beyond the amount fixed by it.” But he adds, “It’ll be very difficult to run a campaign with such a small amount of money.”",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/How-political-parties-try-to-get-past-EC-guidelines-to-fish-for-votes/articleshow/7854123.cms

McDowell's No.1 Platinum advertisement featuring MS Dhoni takes a dig at Royal Stag,"['Sagar Malviya', 'Sarah Jacob']","https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-8968999,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-20612,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2011-06-24T00:34:00,"MUMBAI | BANGALORE: Has ace spinner Harbhajan Singh made it large with Royal Stag United Spirits has got his captain MS Dhoni to say what matters is being different.In a rare case of a spoof in surrogate advertising, Vijay Mallya’s United Spirits has issued a commercial for McDowell’s No. 1 Platinum, which is a spoof on an advertisement for Seagram’s Royal Stag, Pernod Ricard’s largest-selling whisky in India.The Royal Stag ad shows the Indian spinner opting to not work in his father’s ball bearing factory and focus on cricket instead. At the end, he asks the viewer if with his achievements he has “made it large” in life. Taking a dig at the commercial and Royal Stag’s tagline ‘Make it large’, the McDowell’s No. 1 Platinum commercial shows a Bhajji look-alike making ball bearings the size of gym balls at his father’s factory, asking if he had “made it large”, only to get slapped by his father for being incompetent. Then it shows Dhoni saying, “Zindagi main kuch karna hai to large chodo, kuch alag karo yaar.”Liquor brands are not allowed to advertise in India. And both the mentioned commercials are ostensibly for Royal Stag cricket gear and McDowell’s No. 1 Platinum soda.Such surrogate advertising is common in a country where the alcohol consumption is growing rapidly as it becomes socially more acceptable and people prefer more expensive brands as their incomes rise. The Indian liquor market grew 16.1% to 234.4 million cases (of nine litres each) in 2010.The country’s ad industry has also seen several spoofs over the years, including Pepsi versus Coca-Cola, Rin versus Tide and Kingfisher versus Jet Airways. But spoof in a surrogate advertisement is complicated, say experts.“It’s a multilayer concept, that too in a surrogate advertising; any spoof will further complicate the communications,” said Draftfcb Ulka CEO Ambi Parameswaran. “It’s more driven by brand rivalry and competition among marketing teams.”DIRECT COMPETITIONMcDowell’s No.1 Platinum whisky, launched last year April, is priced exactly at the same rate as Royal Stag. Its sales have crossed one million cases within a year. Royal Stag, French distiller Pernod Ricard’s locally made blended whisky launched in 1995, sold 11 million cases last calendar. Clearly, United Spirits wants to drink into the Royal Stag market with McDowell’s No.1 Platinum.But its spoof has not gone down well with everybody. “It is in bad taste, this type of advertising has never been used in the Indian liquor industry,” an industry official said, seeking anonymity. An email questionnaire sent to Pernod Ricard , makers of Chivas Regal whisky and Absolut vodka, remained unanswered. United Spirits executives too could not be reached.Pernod Ricard has not yet lodged a complaint with the Advertising Standards Council of India, the self-regulatory advertising watchdog, which dealt with a complaint every alternate day last year.Interestingly, Dhoni’s advertising assault is on a brand that he endorsed until July 2010. Dhoni, along with teammate Yuvraj Singh, was signed on to endorse Royal Stag in 2006. Harbhajan Singh has been endorsing the brand since 2003.Dhoni was signed up for a three-year endorsement deal for McDowell's No. 1 Platinum in January for Rs 26 crore in one of the highest deals for a sportsperson at the time.Bobby Pawar, chief creative officer of Mudra Group, the advertising agency that handles McDowell, said the dig at ‘Make it large’ is to say that not everything needs to be large and that a tit-for-tat reaction from Pernod Ricard is welcome.“It's a very competitive market and even they are welcome to have a go at us. At the end, if two brands are having a difference of opinion in open, it's the end users who stand to gain,” he said.WHEN SPOOFS WORKFuture Brands CEO and advertising veteran Santosh Desai, however, feels the impact of the commercial will be limited. “It (the commercial) will surely create some short-term interest, but this (spoof) works best when there is a bi-polar market which is not the case here,” he said.Some industry watchers say McDowell’s No. 1 Platinum had made a veiled attack on Royal Stag’s Harbhajan Singh earlier as well. A commercial aired after the T20 World Cup referred to how experts would have asked Dhoni to go with a lead spinner with more than 200 international wickets in the last over of the final, but he had other ideas.Global cola giants Coca-Cola and PepsiCo were the ones that introduced the concept of spoofs and pot-shot advertising to Indian viewers. During the 1996 cricket World Cup, played in the subcontinent, Coca-Cola had spent more than $4 million for the rights to be the official sponsor. But Pepsi came out with a cheeky and popular TV spot saying ‘Nothing official about it’.Since then, both the cola firms have been flooding the television space with cheeky ads and at times, counter pot shots too. But apart from cola ad wars, several companies in the last two years have been increasingly getting involved in such spoofs.For instance, GlaxoSmithKline’s Horlicks spoofed Heinz’s Complan in a campaign where it almost showed the product shot of the Complan brand.Even in HUL’s Rin TV commercial, archrival P&G’s Tide Natural was prominently displayed along with the voiceover “Tide se kahin behtar safedi de Rin” (Rin washes much whiter than Tide).Ditto, in the case of Paras Pharma’s Set Wet Zatak that spoofed HUL’s Axe deodorant by showing a thin, bare-bodied man swinging two axes around himself, in manner of wearing a deodorant. Most of these cases were taken to the advertising watchdog.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/advertising/McDowells-No-1-Platinum-advertisement-featuring-MS-Dhoni-takes-a-dig-at-Royal-Stag/articleshow/8968977.cms
What the battle between Diageo & Vijay Mallya over United Spirits means for the company,['Binoy Prabhakar'],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-47217092,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-51766,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2015-05-10T06:53:00,"These contentious financial transactions explain why United Spirits delayed reporting its fourth-quarter earnings thrice last year. It finally did in September 2014. United Spirits launched an enquiry into its accounting practices soon after, culminating in the decision of the board on April 25 asking Mallya to step down.Anand Kripalu, who was handpicked by Diageo as chief executive officer in October 2013 and took office on May 1, 2014, led the enquiry. He was assisted by a London team of audit firm PwC.Mallya refused to resign. He released a statement on April 25 declaring that the PwC report was based on half-truths and twisted facts and Kripalu, the former head of Cadbury India, was merely parroting the report. The United Spirits board said it will approach shareholders to seek Mallya’s removal.Diageo, which owns nearly 55% of United Spirits, also said it would review its shareholder agreement with Mallya. United Spirits has refused to publicly share the findings of the internal enquiry report. On Thursday, it informed the Bombay Stock Exchange that the report contained sensitive information that would benefit competitors and invite defamation from persons accused of wrongdoing.Shaken and StirredA protracted boardroom battle looms and none of the parties are likely to emerge unscathed. Mallya said he was surprised by the allegations against him because Diageo had conducted an extensive due diligence exercise at United Spirits over four months during which details of all transactions were disclosed to them. The Rs 200-crore notice by the creditor belies that claim. The financial irregularities establish that the due diligence by Diageo, a company whose products are sold in no less than 180 countries, was far from perfect.They also call into question the audit of PwC despite its protestations that it stopped auditing United Spirits books after 2011. The forensic audit by PwC’s London team finds fault with transactions by United Spirits between 2010 and 2012 — possibly regarding loans advanced by United Spirits to UB Group entities that were used to keep Kingfisher aloft — while the statutory audit conducted by the Indian team of PwC gave a clean chit in at least two of those years.But the party with the highest stakes is undoubtedly Diageo. The company, owner of brands such as Smirnoff vodka and Johnnie Walker whisky, has had a chequered history in India. In 2002, its operations in India came to a stop when it sold Gilbey’s Green Label, a successful whisky brand, to UB Group. The company was back four years later. It dropped a long-held strategy of focussing only on its global labels and turned its attention to creating domestic brands. Diageo was looking to emulate the success of arch rival Pernod Ricard in India.The French distiller, thanks to its acquisition of Seagram in 2001, boasted a portfolio that contained global brands such as Glenlivet and Ballantine’s as well as mass-selling domestic brands such as Royal Stag and Blender’s Pride in India. Diageo launched a whisky brand called Haig in 2006. A year later, it created a joint venture with Radico Khaitan to produce and sell a whisky called Masterstroke Deluxe. Four year later, it launched Rowson’s Reserve, a premium whisky, on its own for the Indian market.All three brands bombed. Abhishek Modi, CEO of Modi Illva India, a joint venture between Umesh Modi Group and liqueur maker Illva Saronno of Italy, said Rowson’s Reserve was the last nail in the coffin for Diageo in India.“They were desperate to buy an Indian company that could help their Indian business going,” he said. United Spirits, which then enjoyed a 40% market share, seemed a perfect fit (see Pluses for Diageo…). Combined, United Spirits and Diageo preside over 27 regional and 11 global million-case brands, according to The Millionaires’ Club, which ranks spirits brands that sell over a million cases a year.United Spirits by itself owns four of the top 25 growth brands. Diageo also secured Unites Spirits’ mighty nationwide distribution and production network of 64,000 outlets and 32 facilities. Finally, the company seemed to have found a firm footing in the world’s second largest spirits market.Except things haven’t played out in the manner Diageo would have liked (see … And the Minuses). United Spirits posted its biggest ever loss in the March 2014 quarter. It faces legal setbacks. In 2013-14, sales dropped by 3 million from a year ago. Market share has been dropping steadily, hitting 35% in 2014-15 from nearly 50% about five years ago.Rivals Pernod Ricard and Allied Blenders and Distillers have been gaining at the expense of United Spirits, meanwhile. Officer’s Choice whisky, owned by Allied Blenders, has been the fastest-growing brand across all markets and categories since 2011.Ahmed Rahimtoola, head of marketing at Allied Blenders, said overall sales grew 29% to 32 million cases in 2014-15. Officer’s Choice, which falls under the regular whisky category (see Whisky: Sales and Categories), grew 16% despite the segment contracting 1%, he said.Pernod Ricard’s progress has been even more remarkable. It happens to be the only liquor company to have tasted success with both imported and domestic liquor. India is now its fourth largest market. The company has given the freedom to teams in each market to develop the strategy of brands and portfolios. They are also responsible for production and plant management.Deepak Roy, CEO, Allied Blenders, said Pernod Ricard always had a great sales strategy. “They were never focussed on volumes. They believe in building brands,” he said.In contrast, United Spirits seems hobbled by a sales dilemma — should it be focussing on premium global brands from the Diageo stable or the mass-selling brands from its own portfolio? (Diageo won minority shareholder approval in January 2015 for United Spirits to make, sell and distribute its products.) One category or certain brands within a category seem to be hurting due to this confusion.Take Royal Challenge whisky. The brand’s prices were slashed last year to compete with Pernod Ricard’s Royal Stag and Allied Blenders’ Officers Choice Blue. In Rajasthan, for example, a 750 ml bottle of Royal Challenge Classic Premium Whisky costs Rs 440 compared with Rs 433 for 750 ml of Royal Stag Deluxe Whisky.The price cuts propped up volumes. United Spirits said the brand grew 27% in 2013-2014. But industry observers said the “repositioning” of Royal Challenge was a departure from the company’s so-called premiumisation agenda — an affinity to sell premium brands rather than the cheaper mass-selling brands. United Spirits justified the price cut as part of a constant endeavour to reach new consumers.But the attention of chief competitor Pernod Ricard on premium brands such as Blender’s Pride (Indian) and 100 Pipers (imported) has been unwavering. The company began to use grain spirit in the blend rather than molasses, which give Indian whiskeys the flavour of rum, forcing others to follow suit. Molasses has also turned expensive after the government began using molasses-distilled ethanol as fuel to reduce the dependency on petrol.The premium segment comprises only 4% (5-6 million cases a year) of the total Indian whisky market, but in terms of value, the segment is worth more than Rs 2,000 crore and is growing at a scorching pace. Rahul Gagerna, president, sales and marketing, Radico Khaitan, said premiumisation is the future of the liquor industry.“Volumes matter, but margins matter more because a company has to constantly innovate and put money into marketing,” he said. Allied Blenders’ Roy said launching products in the premium segment has become a matter of survival for the industry. “Better prices offer better margins.”Being the pioneer in premiumisation, Pernod Ricard’s profitability has outpaced competitors. Indian drinkers, thanks to higher disposable incomes, are experimenting with pricier drinks. India is the third biggest market for Scotch whisky, with sales growing 30% last year, despite exorbitant prices due to a 150% basic customs duty. Even if 5% of consumers used to drinking cheap brands switch to drinking premium brands, it would deliver significant gains to drinks companies.As Diageo’s experience in India shows, launches are difficult for drinks companies. In the past 10 years, few new brands have been introduced in the market. Even Pernod Ricard’s moneyspinners are old.That means every drinks company relies on 2-3 brands. Radico Khaitan has Magic Moments vodka and Morpheus brandy. Pernod Ricard has Royal Stag, Blender’s Pride and Imperial Blue. Allied Blenders has Officer’s Choice and Officer’s Choice Blue. United Spirits has Royal Challenge, McDowell’s No. 1 and Signature, but these brands are facing pricing pressures due to stiff competition.It doesn’t help that the new management under Kripalu is still realigning portfolios. In January, Ivan Menezes, CEO, Diageo, told investors after the interim results for the six months ended December 2014 were reported that the integration with United Spirits is a complex process “which will take us through the second half of the year”.David Cutter, president, global supply and procurement told investors on April 28 that India is a complex place to do business and it will be three years before United Spirits supply will record a solid score within the base level of the performance tracker. In Diageo’s defence, this confusion in sales strategy is a matter of legacy. Under Vijay Rekhi, who stepped down as managing director in April 2011, United Spirits single-mindedly pursued volumes. It sold more than 100 million cases (one case contains 12 bottles of 750 ml liquor) in 2009-10.But under the stewardship of Ashok Capoor, who replaced Rekhi, United Spirits turned its gaze on profitability. The switch hasn’t been smooth. The sales team, whose job is to ensure booze reaches shops, has long been used to selling mass-selling brands. The same thing can be said of the marketing team that is tasked with pushing consumers to buy booze. Advertising by United Spirits has slumped in recent years compared with that of rivals.In India, alcohol advertising is strictly regulated, forcing companies to embrace surrogate advertising — associations with music festivals, CDs and bottled water. In the Blenders’ Pride TV commercial, for example, actor Priyanka Chopra is eloquent about style, but the prominent company logo ensures that the message is not lost.United Spirits could have gotten away with its advertising slumber if it weren’t for rivals snapping at its heels. The company also has to get its house in order. As it happens with cross-border mergers, the Diageo-United Spirits marriage has been a clash of cultures — two companies used to doing business differently.There was another problem — United Spirits was packed with Mallya loyalists. PA Murali who resigned as chief financial officer in April was one. So are Amrit Thomas and PS Gill who were elevated as marketing and sales heads after Diageo took control. In October 2013, Diageo inducted 150 people on its rolls into the United Spirits sales team.United Spirts has now formed an executive committee that has Thomas and Gill, among others, and a management committee, which will have a few members reporting to some members of the executive committee. Diageo executives said they are putting in roadmaps to quickly bring United Spirits facilities up to a global minimum standard that satisfies Diageo’s internal standards as well as local regulatory and statutory laws.But there is no telling if more nasty surprises are in store for United Spirits. Consider this: the board of directors had not approved the Rs 200-crore loan and yet a creditor came calling. BSR & Co wondered if the claim by the creditor was a case of ‘fraud’ and whether there were other instances of a similar nature.A United Spirits spokeswoman said auditors KPMG and Deloitte have conducted checks and so the company does not expect similar claims in future. She didn’t answer other questions pertinent to the article. Mallya and PwC did not comment.Since late 2013, United Spirts has been consumed by its battle with Mallya and cleaning up the mess created by UB Group’s unabated aid to Kingfisher. Few in the industry were surprised by the turn of events. The rising friction between the two sides reached a flashpoint when United Bank of India declared Mallya as a wilful defaulter in September 2014. Auditors BSR & Co reminded the United Spirits board that a Reserve Bank of India’s circular on wilful defaulters “along with certain covenants in the loan agreements” sanctioned by the company’s bankers could affect the availability of credit facilities to the company.A former employee of United Spirits said Mallya had suddenly become a liability. Diageo executives began camping in Bengaluru, the headquarters of United Spirits, after the deal came into effect in July 2013. A systematic attempt to alienate him accelerated soon after, he said, asking not to be named. “At first they nudged him, then they went nuclear. You only have to check the language of the company spokeswoman that has changed from polite to firm to plain nasty.”Diageo has achieved its objectives as regards Mallya, according to this person. “They have ended the honeymoon, they have cited financial irregularities, which is bound attracted the attention of the regulators. A regulatory probe will force Mallya to step down. And the United Spirits stock is up (40% since September 30 2014).”A clean break from the Mallya legacy might be the easy part for United Spirits. The market is a different matter. Growth in the Indian liquor industry has slowed to low single digits in recent years and has been flat in the last two years. Being a state subject in India, every state uses different laws to govern the liquor business. Governments have been steadily spiking taxes and duties so much so that in most states the levies constitute about three-fifths the street price of products. Cost pressures are mounting but companies are unable to pass it onto consumers because they require government approvals to raise prices.But the biggest impediment for United Spirts under Diageo’s watch could be the manner it does business in India. In 2011, Diageo agreed to pay more than $16 million to settle charges in the US that employees paid bribes in India, Thailand and South Korea to obtain sales and tax benefits.The company insists it has built systems and controls to prevent illicit payments. At United Spirits too, it has been doing the same through courses on ethics and focussing on “getting the right controls and compliance framework in place”. In Tamil Nadu, a particularly ‘difficult’ market, Diageo sold United Spirits’ distillery in 2014 and signed a licensing deal to sell brands from the United Spirits stable in the state.Illicit payments and trade incentives are entombed in the Indian liquor industry, said an industry insider who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “What will United Spirits do in a corrupt but lucrative market like Uttar Pradesh? Will it exit?” The former United Spirits executive said he participated in the ethics courses and guffawed at some of the questions. “Diageo has to deal with governments of more than 20 big liquor markets in India. In India, you cannot build a business the size of United Spirits and run it by going by the book.”",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/liquor/What-the-battle-between-Diageo-Vijay-Mallya-over-United-Spirits-means-for-the-company/articleshow/47216993.cms
Refurbish Gymkhanas but retain the buttered toast,['Vikram Doctor'],https://img.etimg.com/photo/65498029.cms,2010-02-26T06:56:00,"Since I write in CD, It might be assumed I'm in favour of more professional management. And so I am, but I must admit that in one category I have my doubts. These are the clubs and gymkhanas scattered across India, relics of the Raj, now colonised by the Indian middle classes. These were never very well run (despite the valiant efforts of many exarmy managers), and their standards have slipped, so some degree of refurbishment and professionalisation is welcome.But how far? A large part of the appeal of the clubs has been their unique atmosphere and in the rush to rejuvenate this risks getting lost. Its one thing to modernise the plumbing and enable WiFi, but quite another to turn their characteristic teakwood interiors into the sort of anonymous hospitality spaces that can be found in any hotel. The saddest signs of ill-judged modernisation are to be found on the menus. A lot of clubs have outsourced catering, all too often at the cost of junking many beloved dishes.Many of these were deeply connected to the history of the clubs, since they were the home dishes of the British, whose cooking is much mocked by those who don't know how simply satisfying they can be. Where are the shepherd's pie, the Welsh rarebits and rugby stews? Where are the open beef sandwiches soaked in gravy, in fact, where is anything with gravy? And where, above all, is the perfect buttered toast?The British have always had a special claim on buttered toast. It is not unique to them, since wherever there is bread gone stale, toast will appear, and quite often butter too, to lather on while the toast is still hot, so that it melts and soaks in, to provide the perfect rich moistness to the crisp dry bread. Yet the British have always appropriated it quite as arrogantly as the Duke of Wellington did in 1814 when he landed in Dover after six years of fighting Napoleon, and ordered that the inn where he was staying provide an unlimited supply of buttered toast. In innumerable British memoirs you will find the Duke's privilege reasserted - whatever else might be on the menu, there had to be lots of buttered toast.Some argue that this was simply because of the damp British climate - hot toast was restorative, eaten by itself or dunked in liquids of varying degrees of alcoholic strength, from where we get the concept of drinking toasts. Damp British bread was also a cause; where the French baguette is a light loaf, more crust than crumb and meant to be eaten soon, British breads have been heavier and moister, and are also baked less frequently. Kitchens always had a supply of slightly stale bread, so toasting was natural, on the open fires that the British also maintained.Making toast often moved out of the kitchens - since cold toast is an abomination, people realised the best thing to do was make it themselves. Children were often given the simple task of holding the toasting forks which involved cautious rotation and vigilance to make sure the slices didn't burn - and they could eat the results. Toast was also one of the first solid foods fed to children, and all this combined to give it a particularly nostalgic value. John Betjeman, the poet of British nostalgia, used it to sum up a child's world, ""Safe, in a world of trains and buttered toast...""",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/corporate-dossier/Refurbish-Gymkhanas-but-retain-the-buttered-toast/articleshow/5617923.cms
"Air India staff forced to borrow, sell assets as salaries are not paid","['Anindya Upadhyay', 'Sabarinath M']","https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-9389547,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-108595,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2011-07-28T06:25:00,"NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: The 40-year-old Air India Staff Colony Consumer's Cooperative Society provides monthly household goods to some 8,000 employees of the national carrier residing in the suburban Mumbai colony.In good times, the cooperative would provide credit, including funds to take capital goods on hire purchase, to the tune of 35 lakh every month to some 4,000 members. The money would be deducted from monthly salaries.But these are turbulent times for Air India, which is bleeding losses of a little over Rs 20 crore a day. Employees have not been paid for two months-and the salary for July looks uncertain.That's bad news for the cooperative society. ""We are not able to deduct from salaries for the past two months. If this situation persists, we will stop providing credit from August,"" shrugs KV Varghese, who manages the cooperative. He adds the number of members approaching the society to buy on credit is increasing, and the hire-purchase scheme has been stopped as monthly instalments were overdue for two months.The woes at Air India Colony are just one manifestation of the financial strife of the airline's 38,000-strong workforce. Almost every cadre of employees, from janitors and peons to engineers and the much-envied and much-pampered pilots, is feeling the pinch, some more than others.Shyam Kumar, who has been working at the airline's Delhi office for 35 years, secretly withdrew his wife's savings and presented it to her as his own salary. ""When she later read in the newspapers that AI employees haven't been paid for two months, I was caught. She confronted me if I had taken debt. I denied it, but actually I have taken debt from her and she doesn't know that,"" says a downcast Kumar.Kumar, however, is among the more fortunate ones who can fall back on their spouse's income. Others are not so lucky. A few have had to sell gold and jewellery to meet monthly obligations. Take S Ramesh, 53, who has pledged his gold chain, gifted by his father at the time of his marriage, with a private lender for Rs 20,000.Ramesh is the head sweeper at the Air India office at the Mumbai airport. A Grade 2 employee with the airline for over 25 years, his monthly salary is a gross of Rs 23,000. ""We were told that within the next three years, we will be making profits and our salaries will rise. Now, it's been exactly three months since I received my salary,"" says Ramesh. Pledging the gold chain is at a best a short-term solution. ""I have to pay 25% interest on the pledge, but I managed household expenses for two months.The future looks grim. Not sure when his next salary will come, Ramesh is spending sleepless nights thinking about sustaining his family of four, which comprises an engineering college-going daughter and a son in school.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/Air-India-staff-forced-to-borrow-sell-assets-as-salaries-are-not-paid/articleshow/9389540.cms
"How high costs, a nanny state and badly behaved men are hurting India's nightlife business",['Nupur Amarnath'],"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-12666064,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-52365,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2012-04-15T00:44:00,"On March 31, 2012, Kuki in a tony south Delhi market shut shop. It started as Kuki in 2007, and like its red butterfly logo, spread it wings to evolve into Kuki XO and finally went out, not so quietly, into the night as Pure by Kuki.The three-level standalone nightclub was co-owned by celebrity DJ Rummy Sharma. In the capital’s partying circuit it was known for its bright red interiors, expensive tipples and ultra glam clientele. But when the rent lease was up for review this year, Sharma realised that to keep the club running would be economically unviable.But egos (after all, he was the owner) aside, Sharma locked up the business after six months of serious thought and is back to his original profession, spinning music, where he reckons he’ll end up making more minus the hassles.“It’s not a profitable business anymore,” he says. And he’s not talking about Kuki per se, but the nightclub business in India. Sharma mentions the prohibitive rentals in the cities, which earlier would eat into 20% of the earnings but now takes up 35-40% of the earnings.Business Isn’t a PartyYet, the business is booming. Fuelled by the young party crowd, businesswise there’s already a promising demand. So how can a business be a great opportunity and a bad proposition at the same time? Let’s do the math. In a city like Mumbai , the so-called party capital of India, if you rent a 2,500-sq ft space at say Rs 300 per sq ft, that’s Rs 7.5 lakh per month in rent.To make it viable, you have to generate Rs 50-60 lakh per month as revenue, meaning Rs 2,000-2,500 in sales per sq ft. That’s why the pint of Corona you order should be priced at Rs 600, which is unrealistic.Like other retail businesses, nightlife too suffers from the high cost of rent. But what adds to the burden, and what is typical of this business, is the high cost of development, the cost of buying imported liquor or even Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL) now, the heavy licence fees and then actually operating the place.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/How-high-costs-a-nanny-state-and-badly-behaved-men-are-hurting-Indias-nightlife-business/articleshow/12666024.cms
