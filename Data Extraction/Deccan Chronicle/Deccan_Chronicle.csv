Alcoholics Anonymous: The helping hand for addicts,"This group is not a rehabilitation centre or an NGO, but just a fellowship of men and women who share their experiences.",Joyeeta Chakravorty,"May 3, 2016, 3:24 am IST","  What begins as social drinking turns into alcoholism for many, but there are many who want to come out of it.Bengaluru: Sitting at one of the quiet corners of Stracey Memorial High School, a group of about thirty addicts gather late in the evenings to discuss one of the most debilitating issues of all ---alcoholism. What begins as social drinking turns into alcoholism for many, but there are many who want to come out of it.""I was the General Manager at a company until alcoholism gripped me and I was forced to leave the job,"" says 46-year-old Gnaneswar, who has not touched any alcohol for the past six years. ""I haven't even taken a sip of beer in the last 6 years as I am completely out of it,"" says Gnaneswar, who is an active member of Alcoholics Anonymous, Bangalore and helps other alcoholics get rid of this problem.     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); This group is not a rehabilitation centre or an NGO, but just a fellowship of men and women who share their experiences, strength and hope with each other, so that they may solve their common problem and help others recover from alcoholism too. At the age of forty, Gnaneshwar became an alcoholic and was told to leave the house many times.""For me back then alcohol was a religion and I would even lie to get things done my way. I would do it for money as well. All I cared about was drinking,"" says  Gnaneswar. His addiction cost him his job, his family and his friends. ""I still remember the day when I was hospitalized and my father asked me to leave the house as he’d had enough. On the third day, a few people from this group met me and the rest is history!""But he is not alone in the journey to get rid of this addiction. ""There are people who have not touched alcohol for thirty years and they help one another. But the first step is acceptance. “Only if the alcoholic accepts his condition will we include  him into the group, where we don't charge anyone a single penny.""There are 72 centres across the city, which conduct sessions from  7 pm to 8 pm and each centre witnesses around 30 to 40 alcoholics. ""We have teenagers and senior citizens attending our sessions,"" says Gnaneswar. Every single alcoholic who has fully recovered tries to reach out to others as well....

"We are addicted to the absence of absence, says Pooja Bhatt","Actor-director Pooja Bhatt talks about dealing with alcoholism, her reasons for walking out of marriage and other life choices.",geetha jayaraman,"Apr 1, 2017, 12:23 am IST","  Pooja BhattPower, determination and the unabashed guts to state a ‘spade a spade’ — actor-filmmaker-producer Pooja Bhatt is known for speaking the blunt reality of life. Whether it’s through her films like Dushman and Zakhm or her personal life, she did what she found right with conviction. In an interview, she spoke of the stigma of women alcoholism, walking out of marriage, having no children and more.  Alcohol additionWhen you can ‘easily gulp half a bottle of single malt’ without feeling guilty, it’s time to pull the plug, states Pooja. “I have Scottish genes, my grandfather was Scottish. My father was a voracious drinker. So, drinking came naturally to me. It was Christmas when I finally decide to pull the plug. I sat with my four cats, put my phone on the silent mode, made myself dinner, toasted myself with a glass of water and went to bed,” shares the actress who was celebrating her 90 days of sobriety.     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); She further adds, “I quit drinking because I thought somewhere I had fallen in that trap of addiction and the only way to get out of it was to acknowledge it to myself.”Societal stigmaPooja points out the societal stigma associated with women makes them  brush things under the carpet. “I want to break the stigma attached to alcoholism in our country. Women particularly are discouraged from seeking help because it’s a matter of shame for the family. We don’t share our pain or frailties, we cover our weaknesses and it becomes a cancer. Also, people put up this facade that they are under control by saying things like ‘It’s socially acceptable’, ‘I am not that drunk’,” she explains. “It’s the absence of absence we are addicted to. All of us are somewhere lonely and have different ways to cope with it — for some of us it’s alcohol that provides solace.”World — her AA groupShe didn’t need to go to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as she had strong support systems, and speaking openly about the problem helped her overcome it. “To overcome any problem one must have to be real with themselves. I made the world my AA class. I have never been to any AA group meeting neither did I have a medical problem. It was just self-realisation that made me quit. I am 45 and if I wanted to give myself 10 years of living, I had to quit now before I drank myself to the grave. I had to reclaim the sharper, brighter me which got watered down.”  Today, Pooja has a fully stocked bar at home and even pours out drinks for friends and could sit through a party without having the urge to drink. “If I can’t be around alcohol and resist it, it means I’m not in control. Each day strengthens my resolve as I realise I have more hours to a day now. Even when I drank till 4 am, I’d be at work at 10 am but I was burning myself out. Today, I feel lighter with the excess water gone. All the drama alcohol brings is eliminated from my life,” she says.Talking about her biggest achievement so far, she says, “When some of my female friends call me asking for help and advice to overcome their addiction, I feel very good. Though, I am not qualified but I give them motivation to face each day as it comes. I do not believe in having a long-term plan.”   Ending her marriageTwo years ago, Pooja ended her marriage of 12 years. “People did not even think that we could survive a few months together but we were together for 12 successful years. We promised each other that we would never look over each other’s shoulder and live a lie. We didn’t have children which made it easier for us.  One of the prime reasons for ending the marriage was that in the process of being a responsible wife, producer and production designer, I forgot and left the girl in me far behind. People do ask me, ‘Oh, you left your 12 years of marriage to find yourself’. Yes, that bloody well is the reason I left. Not for somebody else or a comfortable life, I gave all that up for being fiercely single and living the life on my own terms.”Having childrenAt one point in her life, she wanted to have six children. “Today, science has advanced to the extent that I could have children whenever I want. Do I want to opt for surrogacy? I do not. At present I do not have any such plans but if I feel like that in future, I might have a child of my own. I am sorry if I am going to disappoint women who feel that becoming a mother completes you. I don’t feel I am any less of a woman for not having a child. I do not think any woman in the world should feel that way. It’s a personal choice.  Why me syndrome“We all go through a phase when we think that why everything bad is happening. I don’t believe in feeling victimised, instead I like facing it on. Would I like to change a few things in life, Yes! But at the end of the day, mistakes are the dues you get to have a full life. And remember it’s a fact that bad thing happens to good people and good things always happen to good people. So, you need to get passed it and me true to yourself,” she states....

"The chat room: âNot prohibition, rehab is the answer to alcoholismâ",Drinking is now a celebrated part of our culture and is an almost inextricable part of meeting,Darshana Ramdev,"May 22, 2016, 5:53 am IST","  Samrat Chadhaâs BMW, which collided with an auto, leaving four injured.Last week, Samrat Chadha, one of the head honchos at the UB Group, drove his BMW into an autorickshaw, injuring three people. After hours of negotiation with the police, he was made to take an alcometer test, which proved positive. With drunken driving incidents like these on the rise - a number of them fatal - and more and more states taking to the idea of prohibition, is it time for Karnataka to follow suit?A counsellor for rehab inmates and long-time member of Alcoholics Anonymous rubbished the idea at once. Suresh (name changed) chose to remain anonymous, in keeping with the group's policy, but said, ""That's quite stupid. The state would lose out on a lot of revenue. And the bottom line is that it would only hit the poor man. The rich, like Samrat Chadha, will not be affected by it at all. They know how to procure alcohol and can afford to pay for it.""     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Chadha, he said, exhibits definite signs of a drinking problem — ""He doesn't know his limits, clearly. This is the second stage of the disease, when the alcoholic begins blacking out. When they are under the influence, they have no idea what they are doing, lose their sense of judgment and don't remember it the next day.""Today's lifestyle, Suresh explained, has a big role to play in these incidents. Drinking is now a celebrated part of our culture and is an almost inextricable part of meeting ""social commitments."" It's up to the individual, he explained, to know his limits. The effects, of course, are mostly visible among the wealthier sections of society - ""A man who doesn't own a car will end up in a brawl on the streets or at home. The principle is the same, though. You don't know what you're doing and the next day, you're wondering what on earth happened.""Not everybody who drinks has a problem, of course and Alcoholics Anonymous has stats at the ready to back this. ""Out of a 100 people who drink, 10 are problem drinkers,"" Suresh said. ""Out of those ten, three will turn into alcoholics."" And it's unfair to  blame the condition on anybody else, he added. ""The blame game can go on and on - your boss fired you, so you drink. Your wife didn't listen to you, so guess what - you drank! Every alcoholic has a thousand excuses to have a drink and it's upto him to come to terms with it.""Still, the fact that money is easy to come by these days has played a major role in the drinking culture we see today. ""Everyone can afford to go out for a drink - or three. It's a part of office life as well - corporate companies need to spread awareness among their employees. Alcohol is a fashion statement.""The onus cannot be lifted entirely from the government, even if prohibition is not the answer - ""I might be an A.A. member, but that doesn't mean I'm against drinking,"" Suresh remarked, with a laugh. ""Still, the government can spread awareness and work with groups like A.A. - who will help for free, by the way. We need more stringent rules in place."" Getting caught for driving drunk means a fine, yes, but that's the end of that and it simply won't do.""Every time a case of drunken driving or domestic abuse brought on by alcohol is reported in the station, cops should know what to do. Sending people to rehab or to A.A. meetings for a stipulated time period should become part of the system. That's how things are done in the West and it works very well. But we, as a society, don't understand the meaning or the implications of alcoholism."" Far from recommending an A.A. meeting to a repeat offender, cops, he said, respond with, ""Did the wine shop invite these people to drink'? That's the kind of reaction we get, even though we don't charge any money for what we do.""Very little government funding goes into long term plans, Suresh added. ""You have departments like the Welfare Board, which don't do anything. They're just a farce and completely politically motivated. If a little bit of the money allocated to them was put to the use for which it was intended, society would come a long way.”...

Under 25 Lit Fest: Itâs time to hear voices of the young!,"A first-of-its kind event in the city, this festival will cater entirely to audiences between the ages of 18 and 25.",Darshana Ramdev,"May 28, 2016, 1:46 am IST","  This unique lit fest is designed to be short and snappy.Bengaluru: Man Booker Prize nominee Jeet Thayil, journalist Shekhar Gupta, historian Vikram Sampath and author Manu Pillai will all find their way to the Hummingtree in June, for the Under 25 Lit Fest.What: Under 25 Lit FestWhen: June 19, 10 am onwardsWhere: Hummingtree, Indiranagar     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); A first-of-its kind event in the city, this festival will cater entirely to audiences between the ages of 18 and 25, bringing them a host of well-known writers, discussions, workshops, poetry slams, an open mic and the Human Library. âThatâs a novel concept we came up with,â said festival curator Surya Harikrishnan.This unique lit fest is designed to be short and snappy. Audiences will learn how to put out a well-worded tweet or write a brief creatively. Whatâs a human library, you ask? âPicture an Alcoholics Anonymous setting,â laughed Surya Harikrishnan, the curator of the Under 25 Lit Fest, a first-of-its kind event in the city, scheduled to take place in June this year.âItâs a space for people to share their deepest, darkest secrets.â Nobody wants to do this, of course, a challenge theyâre meeting with blindfolds! âYou come in there, wearing your blindfold and tell your story. So that way, you get it off your chest, people know what the story is but they donât know who it came from. Your secret is still safe.â Then, thereâs the BYOB - Bring Your Own Book - which lets you connect with strangers over the literature that changed your life.As if all this isnât enough, the Under 25 Lit Fest features a host of well-known writers (no, theyâre not all under 25 too!) Jeet Thayil, Vickramm Sampath,Â  Shekhar Gupta, Dr Shyam Bhat, Durjoy Dutta and Manu Pillai are among the 35-odd writers from across the country who will participate in the festival. âWeâre not having hour-long panels either, because the fest is only for a day. Weâre making it shorter and crisper - thereâs no room for lengthy rants.â Thatâs in keeping with the youth culture today - delivered in a 140 characters or less!Whatâs more, the festival doesnât limit itself to books. âWeâre looking at all forms of communication, including social media and oral expression,â Harikrishnan explained. This includes subjects like, how to present a creative brief or how to express yourself on twitter. âOur writers are over the age of 25, but the topics for discussion are all very relevant to the youth.â Their subjects range from mythology and politics to twitter, all of them constructed to appeal to the young audience. âAt the same time, we donât want to dumb everything down. We know that weâre catering to a niche, even if that niche comprises a significant number of people,â Hariskrishnan added.The idea came about after the massive success of the Under 25 Clubâs startup fest. âWe had something that covered business and we wantedÂ  to expand our reach,â he explained. The idea was to have an arts festival,Â  but this was quickly dismissed because it meant a lack of focus. âIt was tooÂ  broad to have any real impact.âFunding is always a problem - thisÂ  is a lesson Harikrishnan has learned all too well from his involvement with the Bangalore Literature Festival. Corporate sponsorships and funding is very hard to come by. âMoney is an issue, but we have made it work so far,â he said. This they have achieved by collaborating with a network of startups and young entrepreneurs. âTheyâre all pitching in with different things. One company is giving us a sound system and so on ,â he said.The response from authors, however, has been overwhelming. âAll of them have loved the idea and we do have a number of big names coming in,â he pointed out.Panel discussions, an open mic one-on-one sessions with authors, workshops, the Human Library and the BYOB are all crammed into what is certain to be a jam-packed, thoroughly exciting day. âI have learned that with the youth, itâs all about the general feel of things. They need a good vibe to feel involved.â... 			Tags: bangalore literature festival, under 25 lit fest 			Location: India, Karnataka, Bengaluru "

Loveshhuda movie review: Will leave you with a bad hangover,"The 131 minutes of this film has just been padded up with fancy locations, barrels of alcohol and lots of big wet kisses.",rohit bhatnagar,"Feb 19, 2016, 12:48 pm IST","  A movie still from 'Loveshhuda'.

Can a person survive after consuming that much alcohol?Director Vaibhav Mishra and his team might just want to check into an Alcohol Anonymous programme after chugging down bottles of liquor for their film ‘Loveshhuda’. The film features star kid Girish Kumar and marks the debut of former beauty queen Navneet Dhillon. ‘Loveshhuda’ surely raises the bar high for self-proclaimed drunkards.Gaurav (Girish Kumar), an orphaned boy, is raised single-handedly by his older sister Garima (Tisca Chopra). ‘Loveshhuda’ starts with Gaurav’s grand bachelor party as he is all set to tie the knot with Vandana, an irritating, annoying and controlling posh NRI girl, who has been handpicked by his sister Garima. Gaurav and his spoilt gang start his bachelor party with gallons of alcohol and a bevy of beauties.

In all of the film’s emotional scenes he is seen concentrating on his drinks rather than on his expressions. He dances really well but I guess it would come naturally to anyone who has downed as much alcohol as he has. Navneet Dhillon, who looks impressive in her styling and expressions sails through till the climax (all thanks to her voice dubbing I believe). Tisca Chopra, Navneet Kasturia and Sachin Khedekar are good enough with their performances.Being a Tips Production film, ‘Loveshhuda’ surely has good music. From the peppy dance numbers to Atif Aslam’s break up song ‘Mar Jayein’, the soundtracks are ear soothing.The 131 minutes of this film has just been padded up with fancy locations, barrels of alcohol and lots of big wet kisses. Looking for anything more in this film, is like finding old wine in a new bottle. I believe that the entire budget must have been spent on expensive brands of alcohol. From bachelor parties to an expected climax, alcohol travels in every frame. It is the true hero in the film in every possible manner!‘Loveshhuda’ should have been titled, ‘Daarushhuda’.
