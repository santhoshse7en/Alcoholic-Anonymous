Alcoholics Anonymous: The helping hand for addicts,"This group is not a rehabilitation centre or an NGO, but just a fellowship of men and women who share their experiences.",,"May 3, 2016, 3:24 am IST","What begins as social drinking turns into alcoholism for many, but there are many who want to come out of it.

Bengaluru: Sitting at one of the quiet corners of Stracey Memorial High School, a group of about thirty addicts gather late in the evenings to discuss one of the most debilitating issues of all ---alcoholism. What begins as social drinking turns into alcoholism for many, but there are many who want to come out of it.

""I was the General Manager at a company until alcoholism gripped me and I was forced to leave the job,"" says 46-year-old Gnaneswar, who has not touched any alcohol for the past six years. ""I haven't even taken a sip of beer in the last 6 years as I am completely out of it,"" says Gnaneswar, who is an active member of Alcoholics Anonymous, Bangalore and helps other alcoholics get rid of this problem.

This group is not a rehabilitation centre or an NGO, but just a fellowship of men and women who share their experiences, strength and hope with each other, so that they may solve their common problem and help others recover from alcoholism too. At the age of forty, Gnaneshwar became an alcoholic and was told to leave the house many times.

""For me back then alcohol was a religion and I would even lie to get things done my way. I would do it for money as well. All I cared about was drinking,"" says Gnaneswar. His addiction cost him his job, his family and his friends. ""I still remember the day when I was hospitalized and my father asked me to leave the house as he’d had enough. On the third day, a few people from this group met me and the rest is history!""

But he is not alone in the journey to get rid of this addiction. ""There are people who have not touched alcohol for thirty years and they help one another. But the first step is acceptance. “Only if the alcoholic accepts his condition will we include him into the group, where we don't charge anyone a single penny.""

There are 72 centres across the city, which conduct sessions from 7 pm to 8 pm and each centre witnesses around 30 to 40 alcoholics. ""We have teenagers and senior citizens attending our sessions,"" says Gnaneswar. Every single alcoholic who has fully recovered tries to reach out to others as well.","['alcoholics', 'addicts', 'alcoholic', 'group', 'alcohol', 'turns', 'alcoholism', 'touched', 'gnaneswar', 'drinking', 'hand', 'anonymous', 'leave', 'helping']","What begins as social drinking turns into alcoholism for many, but there are many who want to come out of it.

"We are addicted to the absence of absence, says Pooja Bhatt","Actor-director Pooja Bhatt talks about dealing with alcoholism, her reasons for walking out of marriage and other life choices.",,"Apr 1, 2017, 12:23 am IST","Power, determination and the unabashed guts to state a ‘spade a spade’ — actor-filmmaker-producer Pooja Bhatt is known for speaking the blunt reality of life. Whether it’s through her films like Dushman and Zakhm or her personal life, she did what she found right with conviction. In an interview, she spoke of the stigma of women alcoholism, walking out of marriage, having no children and more.

Alcohol addition

When you can ‘easily gulp half a bottle of single malt’ without feeling guilty, it’s time to pull the plug, states Pooja. “I have Scottish genes, my grandfather was Scottish. My father was a voracious drinker. So, drinking came naturally to me. It was Christmas when I finally decide to pull the plug. I sat with my four cats, put my phone on the silent mode, made myself dinner, toasted myself with a glass of water and went to bed,” shares the actress who was celebrating her 90 days of sobriety.

She further adds, “I quit drinking because I thought somewhere I had fallen in that trap of addiction and the only way to get out of it was to acknowledge it to myself.”

Societal stigma

Pooja points out the societal stigma associated with women makes them brush things under the carpet. “I want to break the stigma attached to alcoholism in our country. Women particularly are discouraged from seeking help because it’s a matter of shame for the family. We don’t share our pain or frailties, we cover our weaknesses and it becomes a cancer. Also, people put up this facade that they are under control by saying things like ‘It’s socially acceptable’, ‘I am not that drunk’,” she explains. “It’s the absence of absence we are addicted to. All of us are somewhere lonely and have different ways to cope with it — for some of us it’s alcohol that provides solace.”

World — her AA group

She didn’t need to go to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as she had strong support systems, and speaking openly about the problem helped her overcome it. “To overcome any problem one must have to be real with themselves. I made the world my AA class. I have never been to any AA group meeting neither did I have a medical problem. It was just self-realisation that made me quit. I am 45 and if I wanted to give myself 10 years of living, I had to quit now before I drank myself to the grave. I had to reclaim the sharper, brighter me which got watered down.”

Today, Pooja has a fully stocked bar at home and even pours out drinks for friends and could sit through a party without having the urge to drink. “If I can’t be around alcohol and resist it, it means I’m not in control. Each day strengthens my resolve as I realise I have more hours to a day now. Even when I drank till 4 am, I’d be at work at 10 am but I was burning myself out. Today, I feel lighter with the excess water gone. All the drama alcohol brings is eliminated from my life,” she says.

Talking about her biggest achievement so far, she says, “When some of my female friends call me asking for help and advice to overcome their addiction, I feel very good. Though, I am not qualified but I give them motivation to face each day as it comes. I do not believe in having a long-term plan.”

Ending her marriage

Two years ago, Pooja ended her marriage of 12 years. “People did not even think that we could survive a few months together but we were together for 12 successful years. We promised each other that we would never look over each other’s shoulder and live a lie. We didn’t have children which made it easier for us. One of the prime reasons for ending the marriage was that in the process of being a responsible wife, producer and production designer, I forgot and left the girl in me far behind. People do ask me, ‘Oh, you left your 12 years of marriage to find yourself’. Yes, that bloody well is the reason I left. Not for somebody else or a comfortable life, I gave all that up for being fiercely single and living the life on my own terms.”

Having children

At one point in her life, she wanted to have six children. “Today, science has advanced to the extent that I could have children whenever I want. Do I want to opt for surrogacy? I do not. At present I do not have any such plans but if I feel like that in future, I might have a child of my own. I am sorry if I am going to disappoint women who feel that becoming a mother completes you. I don’t feel I am any less of a woman for not having a child. I do not think any woman in the world should feel that way. It’s a personal choice.

Why me syndrome

“We all go through a phase when we think that why everything bad is happening. I don’t believe in feeling victimised, instead I like facing it on. Would I like to change a few things in life, Yes! But at the end of the day, mistakes are the dues you get to have a full life. And remember it’s a fact that bad thing happens to good people and good things always happen to good people. So, you need to get passed it and me true to yourself,” she states.","['bhatt', 'things', 'pooja', 'day', 'life', 'addicted', 'children', 'good', 'absence', 'women', 'feel', 'marriage', 'having']","Power, determination and the unabashed guts to state a ‘spade a spade’ — actor-filmmaker-producer Pooja Bhatt is known for speaking the blunt reality of life.

Helping alcoholics kick the bottle!,Today Harsha is a happily married man and he calls himself a good son and a good father.,,"Aug 28, 2017, 1:23 am IST","BENGALURU: Despite measures being taken by several states to make the sale and consumption of alcohol illegal, reports suggest that it hardly impacts the alcoholics, as they find various ways to consume alcohol.

With a vision to end the long term ramifications that alcohol has on the individual and the chain of relationships dependent on the individual, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), a non-profit group of men and women, share their experiences in order to help others recover from the addiction.

Anand, a member of the AA, terms alcoholism as a disease. He said, “People do not understand that it is a disease which can be compared to diabetes, where patients despite being advised to stay away from sugar would be tempted to consume it.”

He adds that AA being a fellowship of men and women approach the alcoholic who wants to quit drinking, as only an alcoholic can understand the trauma of another alcoholic.

While the de-addiction centre isolates the individual by keeping them in a protected area, AA volunteers aim to bring the alcoholics to the mainstream by the volunteers sharing their personal experiences.

Harsha (name changed), one of the recovered members of AA, who quit alcohol consumption six years ago, shares his experience with Deccan Chronicle, “I was 21 when I was an alcoholic. It ultimately led to my isolation as nobody gave me respect. Despite having a good job I was paranoid,” he said.

Today Harsha is a happily married man and he calls himself a good son and a good father.

There are over 93 groups of AA in Bengaluru and meetings are conducted at schools and churches twice a week. Out of 2,500 members of AA, Anand said 705 are active members.","['alcoholics', 'volunteers', 'members', 'alcoholic', 'alcohol', 'kick', 'individual', 'bottle', 'despite', 'good', 'aa', 'women', 'helping']","BENGALURU: Despite measures being taken by several states to make the sale and consumption of alcohol illegal, reports suggest that it hardly impacts the alcoholics, as they find various ways to consume alcohol.

"AA reaches out to schools now, rural men in TN drink more",Consumption of alcohol is also high in Tamil Nadu. In rural areas 47.4 per cent of men consume alcohol.,,"Aug 1, 2018, 6:15 am IST","Thanjavur: It will be startling to note that the age where someone gets their first taste of alcohol has reduced drastically over the past 12 years in India from 21 to 18 and is now at 13. This is no doubt a matter of concern. Coordinators of ‘Alcoholic Anonymous’, a support group to help people to come out of their drinking problem, said that AA is now holding public awareness meetings in schools also besides colleges because of of this startling report.

AA has even been suggested by courts as co-therapy or follow up counseling. AA is an International fellowship of men and women who have once had a drinking problem. It is a non-professional, self-supporting, non denominational, apolitical and available almost everywhere. Membership is open to anyone who wants to do something about his or her drinking problem.

As per statistics of union health ministry, Telangana stands at top among southern states when it comes to consumption of alcohol. 53.9 per cent of men and 8.8 per cent of women across Telangana consume alcohol. Consumption is higher in rural areas than in towns and cities.

Consumption of alcohol is also high in Tamil Nadu. In rural areas 47.4 per cent of men consume alcohol and in urban areas 46 per cent of men consume alcohol. With respect to women consumption is less with 0,5 per cent in urban areas and 0.3 per cent in rural areas. (In agitations against Tasmac, women are in the forefront in Tamil Nadu). Consumption of alcohol is the lowest in Kerala among southern states. 40.8 per cent of men consume alcohol in urban areas in Kerala and 32.8 per cent in rural areas according to ministry's statistics.","['drinking', 'men', 'alcohol', 'consume', 'urban', 'reaches', 'cent', 'drink', 'aa', 'areas', 'schools', 'women', 'tn', 'rural', 'consumption']","53.9 per cent of men and 8.8 per cent of women across Telangana consume alcohol.

"The chat room: ‘Not prohibition, rehab is the answer to alcoholism’",Drinking is now a celebrated part of our culture and is an almost inextricable part of meeting,,"May 22, 2016, 5:53 am IST","Last week, Samrat Chadha, one of the head honchos at the UB Group, drove his BMW into an autorickshaw, injuring three people. After hours of negotiation with the police, he was made to take an alcometer test, which proved positive. With drunken driving incidents like these on the rise - a number of them fatal - and more and more states taking to the idea of prohibition, is it time for Karnataka to follow suit?

A counsellor for rehab inmates and long-time member of Alcoholics Anonymous rubbished the idea at once. Suresh (name changed) chose to remain anonymous, in keeping with the group's policy, but said, ""That's quite stupid. The state would lose out on a lot of revenue. And the bottom line is that it would only hit the poor man. The rich, like Samrat Chadha, will not be affected by it at all. They know how to procure alcohol and can afford to pay for it.""

Chadha, he said, exhibits definite signs of a drinking problem — ""He doesn't know his limits, clearly. This is the second stage of the disease, when the alcoholic begins blacking out. When they are under the influence, they have no idea what they are doing, lose their sense of judgment and don't remember it the next day.""

Today's lifestyle, Suresh explained, has a big role to play in these incidents. Drinking is now a celebrated part of our culture and is an almost inextricable part of meeting ""social commitments."" It's up to the individual, he explained, to know his limits. The effects, of course, are mostly visible among the wealthier sections of society - ""A man who doesn't own a car will end up in a brawl on the streets or at home. The principle is the same, though. You don't know what you're doing and the next day, you're wondering what on earth happened.""

Not everybody who drinks has a problem, of course and Alcoholics Anonymous has stats at the ready to back this. ""Out of a 100 people who drink, 10 are problem drinkers,"" Suresh said. ""Out of those ten, three will turn into alcoholics."" And it's unfair to blame the condition on anybody else, he added. ""The blame game can go on and on - your boss fired you, so you drink. Your wife didn't listen to you, so guess what - you drank! Every alcoholic has a thousand excuses to have a drink and it's upto him to come to terms with it.""

Still, the fact that money is easy to come by these days has played a major role in the drinking culture we see today. ""Everyone can afford to go out for a drink - or three. It's a part of office life as well - corporate companies need to spread awareness among their employees. Alcohol is a fashion statement.""

The onus cannot be lifted entirely from the government, even if prohibition is not the answer - ""I might be an A.A. member, but that doesn't mean I'm against drinking,"" Suresh remarked, with a laugh. ""Still, the government can spread awareness and work with groups like A.A. - who will help for free, by the way. We need more stringent rules in place."" Getting caught for driving drunk means a fine, yes, but that's the end of that and it simply won't do.

""Every time a case of drunken driving or domestic abuse brought on by alcohol is reported in the station, cops should know what to do. Sending people to rehab or to A.A. meetings for a stipulated time period should become part of the system. That's how things are done in the West and it works very well. But we, as a society, don't understand the meaning or the implications of alcoholism."" Far from recommending an A.A. meeting to a repeat offender, cops, he said, respond with, ""Did the wine shop invite these people to drink'? That's the kind of reaction we get, even though we don't charge any money for what we do.""

Very little government funding goes into long term plans, Suresh added. ""You have departments like the Welfare Board, which don't do anything. They're just a farce and completely politically motivated. If a little bit of the money allocated to them was put to the use for which it was intended, society would come a long way.”","['thats', 'dont', 'rehab', 'suresh', 'prohibition', 'alcoholism', 'answer', 'room', 'chat', 'know', 'drink', 'drinking', 'aa', 'society', 'money', 'problem']","Chadha, he said, exhibits definite signs of a drinking problem — ""He doesn't know his limits, clearly.

Pooja Bhatt will write on her struggle with alcoholism in tell-all book,"Pooja Bhatt, who is a success story in herself, will soon be releasing her book.",,"Mar 16, 2018, 12:07 am IST","Filmmaker and former actress Pooja Bhatt is on a new journey — that to quit alcohol. By her own admission, she had been addicted earlier, but has been sober for a while now. She even spoke extensively about her struggle with alcoholism a few months ago.

Now, Pooja, who is a success story in herself, will soon be releasing her book, which will speak about her battle with alcohol, but she has clearly stated that this isn’t her autobiography.

Adds a source, “The book, which has still not been titled, will widely speak about her journey through drinking and alcoholism. While Pooja and her father have never been to rehab to quit alcohol, they’ve frequently been spotted at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, trying to talk to people on how to kick the bottle.”

Mahesh Bhatt famously quit drinking, after finding dirt on his face on a then-Bombay pavement 28 years ago, and Pooja quit drinking 14 months ago. She even took to Twitter to share the news of her having completed 445 days of sobriety.

“Thank you Lord for the courage to say NO and for the capacity to be able to start all over again if necessary. 445 days sober today & counting. Gratitude for the resilience and strength bestowed with every new step I take! #sobriety #recovery #claimyourjourney (sic),” she wrote.

Known to speak her mind from a very early age, Pooja became Bollywood’s youngest producer at the age of 23, when most other actresses were busy pursuing their acting ambitions.","['bhatt', 'pooja', 'struggle', 'tellall', 'months', 'sober', 'journey', 'alcohol', 'alcoholism', 'write', 'speak', 'drinking', 'book', 'quit', 'days']","Filmmaker and former actress Pooja Bhatt is on a new journey — that to quit alcohol.

Under 25 Lit Fest: It’s time to hear voices of the young!,"A first-of-its kind event in the city, this festival will cater entirely to audiences between the ages of 18 and 25.",,"May 28, 2016, 1:46 am IST","Bengaluru: Man Booker Prize nominee Jeet Thayil, journalist Shekhar Gupta, historian Vikram Sampath and author Manu Pillai will all find their way to the Hummingtree in June, for the Under 25 Lit Fest.

What: Under 25 Lit Fest

When: June 19, 10 am onwards

Where: Hummingtree, Indiranagar

A first-of-its kind event in the city, this festival will cater entirely to audiences between the ages of 18 and 25, bringing them a host of well-known writers, discussions, workshops, poetry slams, an open mic and the Human Library. “That’s a novel concept we came up with,” said festival curator Surya Harikrishnan.

This unique lit fest is designed to be short and snappy. Audiences will learn how to put out a well-worded tweet or write a brief creatively. What’s a human library, you ask? “Picture an Alcoholics Anonymous setting,” laughed Surya Harikrishnan, the curator of the Under 25 Lit Fest, a first-of-its kind event in the city, scheduled to take place in June this year.

“It’s a space for people to share their deepest, darkest secrets.” Nobody wants to do this, of course, a challenge they’re meeting with blindfolds! “You come in there, wearing your blindfold and tell your story. So that way, you get it off your chest, people know what the story is but they don’t know who it came from. Your secret is still safe.” Then, there’s the BYOB - Bring Your Own Book - which lets you connect with strangers over the literature that changed your life.

As if all this isn’t enough, the Under 25 Lit Fest features a host of well-known writers (no, they’re not all under 25 too!) Jeet Thayil, Vickramm Sampath, Shekhar Gupta, Dr Shyam Bhat, Durjoy Dutta and Manu Pillai are among the 35-odd writers from across the country who will participate in the festival. “We’re not having hour-long panels either, because the fest is only for a day. We’re making it shorter and crisper - there’s no room for lengthy rants.” That’s in keeping with the youth culture today - delivered in a 140 characters or less!

What’s more, the festival doesn’t limit itself to books. “We’re looking at all forms of communication, including social media and oral expression,” Harikrishnan explained. This includes subjects like, how to present a creative brief or how to express yourself on twitter. “Our writers are over the age of 25, but the topics for discussion are all very relevant to the youth.” Their subjects range from mythology and politics to twitter, all of them constructed to appeal to the young audience. “At the same time, we don’t want to dumb everything down. We know that we’re catering to a niche, even if that niche comprises a significant number of people,” Hariskrishnan added.

The idea came about after the massive success of the Under 25 Club’s startup fest. “We had something that covered business and we wanted to expand our reach,” he explained. The idea was to have an arts festival, but this was quickly dismissed because it meant a lack of focus. “It was too broad to have any real impact.”

Funding is always a problem - this is a lesson Harikrishnan has learned all too well from his involvement with the Bangalore Literature Festival. Corporate sponsorships and funding is very hard to come by. “Money is an issue, but we have made it work so far,” he said. This they have achieved by collaborating with a network of startups and young entrepreneurs. “They’re all pitching in with different things. One company is giving us a sound system and so on ,” he said.

The response from authors, however, has been overwhelming. “All of them have loved the idea and we do have a number of big names coming in,” he pointed out.

Panel discussions, an open mic one-on-one sessions with authors, workshops, the Human Library and the BYOB are all crammed into what is certain to be a jam-packed, thoroughly exciting day. “I have learned that with the youth, it’s all about the general feel of things. They need a good vibe to feel involved.”","['festival', 'library', 'young', 'lit', 'fest', 'idea', 'youth', 'know', 'voices', 'theyre', 'hear', 'writers', '25']","Bengaluru: Man Booker Prize nominee Jeet Thayil, journalist Shekhar Gupta, historian Vikram Sampath and author Manu Pillai will all find their way to the Hummingtree in June, for the Under 25 Lit Fest.

Prayers can help us resist urge to booze: study,Prayer stimulates the parts of the brain that are responsible for attention and emotion.,,"May 8, 2016, 10:41 am IST","Researchers found that a craving for alcohol could be tempered by the power of prayer. (Photo: Pixabay)

Washington D.C.: When the urge to booze hits you, turn to God, suggests a new study.

After working with longstanding members of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), the New York University researchers found that a craving for alcohol could be tempered by the power of prayer.

According to them, prayer stimulates the parts of the brain that are responsible for attention and emotion. The participants, who were first shown a series of images considered to induce alcohol cravings, reported less desire to drink after they recited a prayer.

Senior author Marc Galanter, Director of the Division of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse at the university, said the experience of going to AA had left some people with an ""innate ability"" to use prayer to minimise the effect of alcohol triggers.

Craving is diminished in long-term AA members compared to patients who have stopped drinking for some period of time but are more vulnerable to relapse, he added.

""Our current findings open up a new field of inquiry into physiologic changes that may accompany spiritual awakening and perspective changes in AA members and others,"" said Dr Galanter.

The study appears in the American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse.","['drug', 'booze', 'researchers', 'prayers', 'members', 'alcohol', 'resist', 'help', 'craving', 'study', 'aa', 'urge', 'tempered', 'power', 'university', 'prayer']","Researchers found that a craving for alcohol could be tempered by the power of prayer.

When people tend to bond less with friends,People tend to alienate other members of a support group as they age,,"Jan 23, 2015, 6:32 pm IST","Washington: A new study has recently revealed that when people move from the early stages of pursuing a goal to a more advanced stage, they tend to alienate other members of a support group.

Szu-chi Huang (Stanford University), Susan M. Broniarczyk (University of Texas at Austin), Ying Zhang (Peking University), and Mariam Beruchashvili (California State University, Northridge) wrote that when consumers start working towards a goal, they often feel uncertain about how to achieve it and see others at a similar stage as friends, so they pass on helpful tips and cheer each other on.

But once the goal was in sight, consumers feel more certain and believe they don't need support from others, so they become distant and keep useful information to themselves, they further added.

Since sharing information benefits consumers, this research can help support groups such as Weight Watchers, Alcoholics Anonymous, or smoking cessation programs find ways to keep people engaged and working toward their goals.

Researchers from University at Buffalo in the US decided to look at a sample of 286 college students to better understand how drinking affects what they eat, both that night and for their first meal the next day when, most likely, they are hungover.

""Given the obesity epidemic and the rates of alcohol consumption on college campuses, we need to be aware of not only the negative effect of alcohol consumption, but also the impact it has on what people are eating while they are drinking,"" said Jessica Kruger, an assistant professor at the University at Buffalo.

Research on the effects of drinking and diet is scarce, Kruger said, adding that eating more unhealthy foods following alcohol consumption is an often overlooked behaviour in traditional addiction research.

The inspiration for the study, published in the Californian Journal of Health Promotion, came from an ad researchers saw in a university newspaper.

""It said, 'Got Drunchies?' and had ads for pizza, tacos, and other fast-food places that were open late after the bars closed,"" Kruger said.

An average beer contains 150 calories. If a person drinks five beers, it accounts for third of their daily energy intake. Add two slices of pizza or a burrito to that at the end of the night, and it's a recipe for weight gain, she said.

""So, we dug a bit deeper and first figured out what the 'drunchies' were, and then decided this would be interesting to study,"" Kruger said.

Study participants were asked to complete an anonymous online survey.

Researchers found that drinking influenced study participants' dietary behaviours before going to bed.

All alcohol drinkers were more likely to eat something before they went to bed after drinking alcohol than in general before they go to bed.

Specifically, they were more likely to opt for salty snack foods and pizza. Healthy foods, such as dark green vegetables and other veggies they would ordinarily eat, were not as appealing.

Of particular concern, the researchers noted, was the fact that participants did not report drinking more water or other non-alcoholic beverages before bed.

That exacerbates dehydration, which may lead to additionally unhealthy food choices.

The following day after drinking, participants' dietary patterns varied from the night before. They were less likely to skip meals the morning after a night of drinking compared to a typical morning.

They favoured foods like pizza or tacos over milk and dairy products and grains, most likely because of the so-called hangover cures that get passed down to students and which entail eating foods that ""soak up"" the alcohol.

Dispelling these myths is one way to promote a healthy diet even after a night of binge drinking, Kruger said.","['thats', 'kruger', 'likely', 'alcohol', 'youre', 'eat', 'foods', 'pizza', 'participants', 'packing', 'drinking', 'university', 'pounds', 'night', 'drunchies']","and had ads for pizza, tacos, and other fast-food places that were open late after the bars closed,"" Kruger said.

Pune: After witnessing prolonged unrest, Film And Television Institute of India may be revamped as its new director Bhupendra Kainthola on Friday hinted towards a crackdown on ragging and alcoholism on the campus.

Spelling out his measures to improve atmosphere on the campus after the scene of 139-day-long strike on the issue of chairmanship of TV actor Gajendra Chauhan drew nought, Kainthola said he would have a ""zero tolerance"" policy for rampant ragging and alcoholism in the premier institute.

""Although I have not received official complaints of ragging, during my interaction with students, particularly females, I have perceived it is happening and they are scared to go on record to say it. Actually, it has resulted in a decline in the number of female students seeking admission to FTII,"" he told PTI in Pune.

Kainthola, who succeeded Prashant Pathrabe recently, said alcoholism too was taking toll on the health of the students and that he had also ""heard"" of instances of drug abuse on the campus. ""We are going to have a zero tolerance policy for all this. If necessary we will rope in institutions such as Alcoholics Anonymous and de-addiction therapists,"" he said.

Outlining his priorities, the FTII director said a revision of the three-year syllabus was underway and he would ensure that the students completed their three year course without spilling over the prescribed timeline.

""We are recruiting new faculty members and we shall also approach famous film industry personalities to interact with the students as visiting faculty in order to impart practical experience for the would-be industry professionals being trained at the FTII,"" he added.

Asked whether the FTII management had any plans to withdraw the cases filed against a group of students booked in connection with the gherao of former director Pathrabe during the heated atmosphere of the strike against Chauhan's appointment, Kainthola said any decision in the matter would be taken after due deliberations.

During the strike, some students had barged into his office of Pathrabe in August last year, objecting to his decision on assessment of 2008 batch projects. ""The matter at present is sub-judice,"" he added.

Binge drinking dramatically ups mortality rate,The new study also showed social risks of drinking,,"Apr 30, 2015, 12:37 am IST","Hangovers are inevitable when it comes to New Year celebrations, here's how you can banish them.

Washington: A new study has provided a link between drinking behaviors with the overall mortality rate.

A new University of Colorado Boulder study involving some 40,000 people indicates that social and psychological problems caused by drinking generally trump physically hazardous drinking behaviors when it comes to overall mortality rates.

The study showed, for instance, that participants who had experienced an intervention by physicians, family members or friends had a 67 percent greater risk of death over the 18-year study period, said sociology Professor Richard Rogers, lead study author. Those who reported cutting down on social or sports activities because of alcohol use had a 46 percent higher risk of death over the same period.

In contrast, issues like driving after drinking too much or engaging in other physically risky behaviors did not result in a significant uptick in mortality rates.

The new study also showed social risks of drinking, from losing jobs to having spouses threaten to leave, were equally or more strongly linked to mortality than physiological consequences of alcohol abuse like withdrawal jitters or becoming physically ill.

One of the most unexpected findings was that of those who identified themselves as light drinkers, consuming less than one drink a day, 48 percent reported having some problem with alcohol in the 12 months prior to the survey.

The research data allowed the CU-Boulder team to investigate the mortality associated with 41 separate drinking problems including drinking more than intended, unsuccessfully trying to cut back, driving a car after drinking too much, losing ties with friends and family, missing work with hangovers, drinking more to get the same effect, depression and arrests.

It was also found that 23 percent started drinking without intending to, 20 percent drank longer than expected and 25 percent experienced a strong urge to drink. For those who experienced a strong urge to drink over the past year, 19 percent were light drinkers, 40 percent were moderate drinkers and 57 percent were heavy drinkers.

Current drinkers who found it difficult to stop once they started had a 15 percent higher risk of death over the follow-up period; those who acknowledged going on a drinking bender during the past 12 months had a 54 percent higher mortality rate; and those who blacked out during the previous 12 months prior to the assessment had a 22 percent higher mortality rate over the 18-year study period.

The new study also showed those who reported attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in the past year had a 45 percent higher risk of mortality.

But those results likely are somewhat misleading in that some of those people could have recently have been diagnosed as alcoholics or were more likely to have severe health, social or legal problems, including required AA attendance. In addition, those who reported attending AA might have had increased risk of mortality due to smoking or may have had other substance abuse problems.

"Is sex addiction real, a crime, or made-up to deflect blame?","When sex addiction contributes to criminal behavior, rehab could bolster a defense attorneyâs argument that the accused has changed.",,"Dec 5, 2017, 5:10 pm IST","When sex addiction contributes to criminal behavior, rehab could bolster a defense attorney’s argument that the accused has changed.

Is sex addiction a true addiction, a crime, or a made-up condition used by misbehaving VIPs to deflect blame or repair tarnished images?

A tide of high-profile sexual misconduct accusations against celebrities, politicians and media members has raised these questions — and sowed confusion. Sex addiction is not an officially recognized psychiatric diagnosis, though even those who doubt it’s a true addiction acknowledge that compulsive sexual behavior can upend lives.

Either way, there is an important distinction, sometimes blurred, between a mental condition and a crime. Some men who have been accused of assault or other sexual crimes have sought treatment for sex addiction or other unspecified conditions. But compulsive behavior is very different from a crime, and the vast majority of people who suffer from sexually compulsive behavior do not harass or assault others.

There’s “an extremely fine line between addict and offender” and sometimes the two overlap, said psychologist Leah Claire Bennett of Pine Grove Behavioral Health & Addiction Services, a rehab center that offers sex addiction treatment in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.

Despite pressure from some therapists, sex addiction was not included in the most recent edition of the manual that psychiatrists use to diagnose mental illness. “The reason is very simple,” said Dr. Charles O’Brien, a University of Pennsylvania psychiatry professor involved in the manual’s 2013 update. There is no rigorous scientific proof that compulsive sexual behavior affects the brain in the same ways that have been shown with addiction to drugs or alcohol, he said.

“There’s an overuse of the word ’addiction,’” O’Brien said. “There are many treatment programs. That doesn’t make it a disorder.”

Still, some skeptics don’t dispute that compulsive sexual behavior can become a serious problem. The issue for some is whether it amounts to mental illness, or whether it might result from a different psychiatric condition, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Robert Weiss, a California-based sex addiction therapist, said the condition involves unrestrained compulsive sexual behavior without regard to consequences. Sometimes that leads to illegal behavior.

The International Institute for Trauma and Addiction Professionals says sex addiction affects from 2 percent to 5 percent of the general population but that only 10 percent of those with this addiction engage in criminal sexual behavior. Most patients and sex offenders are men.

Some treatment programs won’t admit patients accused of rape and other violent sex crimes, referring them to centers or therapists who specialize in treating sex offenders.

Addiction treatment at Pine Grove, The Meadows in Arizona and other high-profile residential rehab centers can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Despite country club-like settings, there’s nothing cushy or indulgent about sex addiction therapy, Weiss said.

Pine Grove requires daylong sessions including group therapy daily for up to three months. Some centers use 12-step programs similar to Alcoholics Anonymous, but they don’t require swearing off sex for good. Some use brain “retraining” exercises, or sharing stories about bad behavior with a roomful of strangers.

Some centers use equine therapy. Weiss says that interacting with horses can help patients recognize problems sometimes associated with sex addiction, including overly aggressive, controlling behavior.

The New York Post published a photograph last year that it said showed former New York Congressman Anthony Weiner riding a horse as part of treatment at a Tennessee sex addiction rehab center. Weiner was sentenced in September for sexting with a teenager. He said at the time that he was undergoing therapy and had been “a very sick man for a very long time.”

Weiss and other therapists say sex addicts are never cured, but they can learn to manage their behavior and avoid triggers, including avoiding jobs and circumstances that could lead to a repeat of problem behavior.

L.J. Schwartz, a former real estate adviser in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, says a nearly 30-year addiction to sex almost ruined his life.

Schwartz says his addiction included having sex with strangers at adult bookstores or masturbating there while watching porn nearly every chance he got; working as a stripper and phone sex. He was never arrested but says his behavior endangered his job and marriage.

“There’s no pleasure derived from sex addiction; it’s pain,” Schwartz said.

He says a 12-step program helped him resist his compulsions and he now works as a recovery coach for other patients.

But hard evidence that treatment works is lacking. “There’s not a lot of data,” Bennett acknowledged.

“We have a lot of anecdotal evidence. We can see the change in people,” she said. She said Pine Grove plans a long-term study to measure the benefits.

Whether treatment can repair tarnished images is uncertain.

“The accusations levied against Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Louis C.K. and others for sexual assault, harassment and abuse have created righteous outrage and concerns that ‘sex addiction treatment’ is being used to excuse their offensive behavior,” the addiction professionals institute said in a recent statement.

Whether any of these men have a diagnosed mental condition has not been publicized.

A representative for Weinstein confirmed that he is receiving treatment and has been taking his recovery and sessions seriously. But the representative declined to specify Weinstein’s condition or the treatment he is receiving for it. A former publicist for Spacey said he also is seeking unspecified treatment.

Bennett said some people do use sex addiction as an excuse, “but that’s not who we’re treating here at Pine Grove. These peoples’ lives are in shambles. They’ve been traumatized throughout their lives. They have huge psychological wounds and are using very maladaptive ways of coping.”

Actor David Duchovny voluntarily sought rehab for sex addiction in 2008 while starring on Showtime’s “Californication.” Married to actress Tea Leoni at the time, he had been dogged by cheating rumors. His career never stalled. He returned to “Californication” for the remainder of its run and has continued to appear in high-profile roles.

When sex addiction may have contributed to criminal behavior, a trip to rehab could bolster a defense attorney’s argument that the accused person has changed, said Samuel Pillsbury, a professor at Loyola School of Law in Los Angeles. But it’s a less effective strategy for violent crimes, he said.

“It’s very difficult for me to imagine a prosecutor deciding, ‘Oh, he’s in rehab, I’ll drop the charges or I’ll reduce the charges significantly,’” Pillsbury said. “But it could have an effect on sentencing.”","['compulsive', 'sex', 'madeup', 'addiction', 'real', 'crime', 'rehab', 'grove', 'treatment', 'sexual', 'therapy', 'behavior', 'condition', 'deflect', 'blame']","When sex addiction contributes to criminal behavior, rehab could bolster a defense attorney’s argument that the accused has changed.

UN chief Ban Ki-moon accuses India of intolerance with gay sex ban,Supreme Court re-imposed a ban on gay sex in late 2013,,"Jan 13, 2015, 4:57 pm IST","U.N.

New Delhi: United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon has accused India of fomenting intolerance with its ban on gay sex amid uproar over a ruling party minister's plans to make homosexuals ""normal"".

Speaking on a visit to New Delhi, Ban said he ""staunchly opposed the criminalisation of homosexuality"" referring to India's colonial-era law that prohibits gay sex.

""I am proud to stand for the equality of all people -- including those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender,"" the UN secretary general said in a statement late Monday.

""I speak out because laws criminalising consensual, adult same-sex relationships violate basic rights to privacy and to freedom from discrimination. Even if they are not enforced, these laws breed intolerance.""

India's Supreme Court re-imposed a ban on gay sex in late 2013, ruling that the responsibility for changing the 1861 law rested with lawmakers and not judges.

Gay sex had been effectively legalised in 2009 when the Delhi High Court ruled that banning ""carnal intercourse against the order of nature"" was a violation of fundamental rights.

Ban's comments came on the same day that a state minister from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party announced his plans to make gays ""normal"" in the coastal resort state of Goa.

Ramesh Tawadkar, sports and youth affairs minister in Goa's state government, told reporters that he planned to open up centres on the lines of Alcoholics Anonymous to treat them.

""We will make them normal. We will have centres for them, like Alcoholic Anonymous centres,"" Tawadkar said, adding that the state would ""train them and give them medicines too"".

Tawadkar, a member of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), made the comments after releasing the state's policy on youth issues which listed lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders as a stigmatised group that needed attention.

His comments drew widespread criticism and ridicule from gay rights groups and social media with jeering remarks posted on Twitter.

Wine testing drive in Coorg after tourist’s complaint,Coorg district excise department officials have launched a massive wine-testing drive in the district,,"Jul 7, 2015, 10:01 am IST","Bengaluru: Plan to enjoy this monsoon at Coorg? Think twice before buying the locally made wine! Based on a complaint lodged by an anonymous tourist from Bengaluru city, Coorg district excise department officials have launched a massive wine-testing drive in the district. The complaint was routed through the district tourism department.

It all started with a city tourist distributing home-made wines brought from Coorg to his friends in the city. According to this anonymous petitioner, immediately after consuming the wine, his friends fell ill. Attributing the cause of illness to the wine, he lodged a complaint with the Coorg tourism department, who in turn forwarded the complaint to the excise department which started a massive inspection drive across the district. Sources say, the reason for the illness was a high alcoholic content.

Confirming the developments, Coorg district Dy Commissioner of Excise Mr. Aziz Ahmed said that the department is trying to find the brand of wine which had the excess alcoholic content. “We are collecting the samples. The petitioner did not give us the exact details of the brand which caused the illness. The state government has fixed a maximum for the alcoholic content in wines. If we find a wine brand which has exceeded the limit for alcohol content, action will be initiated,” he said.

Meanwhile, sources in the state excise department have said that following the incident, locally made wines which do not have primary information such as name of the manufacturer, percentage of alcoholic content, brand name, validity period and manufacturing date are banned from the market.

“Coorg is known for its locally made wines. But the department will not allow a few to take any undue advantage. Our officials have already, banned wine brands which do not provide complete information,” said an officer.

Dev 360: Method and the madness,Maharaj has effortlessly morphed into a story the media loves,,"Jan 15, 2015, 6:45 am IST","It is the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Enid Blyton moment. Instead of the mystery of the disappearing cat or the missing necklace, we have the gripping mystery of the missing show cause notice. Habitually controversial BJP MP Swami Sacchidanand Hari, better known as Sakshi Maharaj, kicked off 2015 by asking Hindu women to have at least four children to expand the flock. Predictably, furore has followed. Sakshi Maharaj is now the staple of prime time television.

Not that the member of Parliament from Unnao, Uttar Pradesh, is the only one who views the Hindu woman’s womb as part of a national project.

But as an MP from the ruling party opposing the government’s avowed goal of reducing the total fertility rate (TFR) the average number of children born to a woman from the current 2.3 to 2.1 by 2017, Maharaj has effortlessly morphed into a story the media loves.

An embarrassed BJP high command says it has served the MP a show-cause notice, asking him to explain why action should not be initiated against him for his controversial remarks in the recent past. Maharaj is supposed to respond within 10 days.

This has prompted the media to chorus that the BJP leadership is finally cracking down on the delinquents in the party.

But is that what it is? Just how low is the cost of making outlandish statements in Indian politics can be gauged by Maharaj’s insouciance in the face of such action.

At the time of writing this column, the MP was breezily telling reporters that he had no information of any notice and that it was an “internal matter” of the BJP, nothing at all to do with the media.

Is such a notice likely to reform Sakshi Maharaj? I doubt it. As many would remember, not so long ago, the same man started a row by describing Mahatma Gandhi’s assassin Nathuram Godse as a “patriot” and was forced to apologise in Parliament.

Those with longer memories or inclined to Google search would also know that in 2006, the Rajya Sabha unanimously adopted the recommendation of the eighth report of the House Ethics Committee for expulsion of Sakshi Maharaj, then a member of the Samajwadi Party. He had featured in a sting operation by a TV channel on the misuse of MP Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS).

Buoyed by Maharaj’s breeziness towards show-cause notices, in West Bengal Birbhum BJP joint district president Shymal Goswami has also taken to advising Hindu women on how many children they should have.

On January 12, while observing the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda at a school, Mr Goswami said Hindu women needed to have five children to counter supposed demographic challenges from minority communities.

In the season of competitive absurdities that has become the hallmark of much of the public discourse in the country, Ramesh Tawadkar, minister of sports and youth affairs in Goa, has also become an international celebrity after a local television channel showed him as saying he would set up centres to make gays and lesbians “normal”. He had details too the centres would be modelled on the lines of Alcoholics Anonymous.

Predictably commotion has broken out and Mr Tawadkar now says he was misunderstood. Goa’s chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar has had to personally clear the air by emphatically stating that Goa has no intentions of doing any such thing.

Anyone who watched the video footage of the interview would wonder if the reporter was trying to bait Mr Tawadkar by asking how he planned to make lesbians and gays “normal”.

Nothing, however, excuses the phenomenally daft response, smacking of ignorance and prejudice.

Outlandish statements are not new. The political landscape is riddled with luminaries in every party whose words and deeds are jaw-droppingly bewildering. You can call them the lunatic fringe.

But many are in responsible positions. Madhya Pradesh home minister Babulal Gaur once said rape is a “social crime which depends on the man and the woman. It is sometimes right and sometimes wrong.”

BJP politicians don’t have a monopoly on bizarre and outrageous statements. Who can forget home minister in the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, and Congress gaffe minister Sushil Kumar Shinde? In his reply to a debate on Assam riots in the Lok Sabha in 2012, Mr Shinde used the word “terrorist” instead of “territorial” for Bodoland Territorial Administration District (BTAD) triggering much mirth in the Opposition benches.

Ajit Pawar, former deputy chief minister of Maharashtra and Nationalist Congress Party leader, famously said, “Should we urinate in dams?” by way of response to a hungerstrike by drought-affected farmers demanding release of dam water.

Samajwadi Party leader Abu Azmi once said that any woman who has sex before marriage should be hanged.

Which brings one to the key question is there an ongoing contest for making the most bizarre statements or is there something more to it than meets the eye?

In a country with the second-highest population in the world, where millions of women do not have access to basic healthcare, including reproductive health, and which has one of the highest numbers of maternal and newborn deaths, how are representatives of the ruling party exhorting women to produce more babies?

Can a minister for youth affairs afford to be so staggeringly ignorant about the reality of LGBT (lesbians, gays, bisexuals and trans-genders)? Can a man tasked to oversee law and order be allowed to be brazenly crass on something as sensitive as rape?

Many commentators have been demanding that all political parties, starting with the one in power, crush the chorus of crazies amidst them.

Here, the question that must be asked is, are they really crazy? What if it is a game aimed at adversaries in order to throw them off balance and divert public attention from discussions of other more pressing issues? International relations experts call it “trash talking.”

One of its most brilliant exponents was former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The image of Mr Ahmadinejad as portrayed in mainstream media was that of a leader who is unhinged from reality.

But, as commentator Kristen Livingston pointed out in a piece in the Journal of Public Diplomacy, this is what we get when we focus on his rhetoric. Instead, the focus should have been on not what he said, but what he had not said.

Going by the ceaseless drip-drip of outrageous statements, one is tempted to think that the lunatic fringe in this country too is not as mad as made out to be. Or rather there is a method in madness. Look out for all the issues that are being pushed to the background because the crazies are in the limelight.

Pregnant woman who drink could be charged with ‘crime of violence’,'Telling a mum is not enough. They need to be helped and supported',,"Nov 27, 2014, 5:20 pm IST","London: A British court is to rule on whether a woman committed a ""crime of violence"" against her child by drinking heavily during pregnancy, in a case that has raised concerns about criminalizing mothers.



A local authority is applying to the government's criminal compensation authority for damages on behalf of a seven-year-old girl in its care who has severe alcohol-related disabilities.



Its lawyers have told the Court of Appeal that her mother was ""reckless"" in her behaviour by drinking up to half a bottle of vodka and eight cans of strong lager a day while she was pregnant.



While they do not suggest the damage was deliberate, they say she discussed her drinking with professionals and ""went on to take the risk"".



The case, in which a ruling is expected next week, has sparked heated debate over the dangers of alcohol and the rights of women and foetuses in a country where abortion has been legal since 1967.



Women's rights groups have warned that it risks opening the door to police action against pregnant women as is increasingly happening in the United States.



""The case is of profound social significance,"" said the British Pregnancy Advisory Service and Birthrights charities.



""If the court were to interpret the law as requested by the council, it would establish a legal precedent which could be used to prosecute women who drink while pregnant.""



However, some commentators say it is a no-brainer.



""What about the rights of the little girl in this case whose life is forever blighted because of what her mother did?"" wrote one furious writer in the Daily Mirror tabloid.



80 cases waiting in the wings



The Court of Appeal judgement will cap a five-year legal battle between the council and the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA).



CICA considers applications for damages involving behaviour that could constitute a crime, in this case the alleged reckless administration of a noxious substance to the foetus.



In the latest stage of the proceedings in December, a judge ruled in CICA's favour and said the foetus was not a person until birth and could not be a victim of crime.



This ruling is now being appealed, with 80 similar claims for compensation waiting on the outcome.



Neil Sugarman, one of the plaintiff's lawyers, denies the case could move Britain closer to prosecuting pregnant women.



""We are not for a minute suggesting that will or ought to happen here,"" he told AFP.



But he acknowledged the whole issue was ""fraught"" with complications, not least because drinking alcohol in itself is not a crime.



""Would it have been different if a woman had said she'd decided to take tonnes of salt and the salt had damaged the child?"" he asked.



'Would I have stopped drinking?'

The girl, known only as CP, has a severe form of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), an umbrella term which covers a range of disorders varying from reduced intellectual ability to heart and kidney problems.



But campaigners say it remains misunderstood and the British government's advice on drinking in pregnancy has been accused of being contradictory.



""No mother drinks intentionally to harm her child,"" said Susie Fleisher, who set up the FASD support group NOFAS-UK after her adopted daughter was diagnosed.



""A woman who has issues with alcohol should have support and not be thrown in prison.""



Linda, a 49-year-old from London, was drinking eight or nine cans of lager a day when she was pregnant with her two eldest children, both in their 20s now.



She had only heard about FASD in passing and says she was offered no support to give up alcohol.



Her first daughter was fine but her second was born with the telltale distorted facial features and now has trouble socializing, controlling her temper and concentrating.



""Telling a mum is not enough. They need to be helped and supported,"" said Linda, who asked to remain anonymous.



She opposes criminalizing pregnant mothers, but acknowledges that some custodial rehabilitation might have helped her.



""I was dependent on alcohol. I needed alcohol. I couldn't get through the day without it.



""Had I been warned of all the potential dangers and then sent home, would I have stopped? Probably not. Not without help.""","['support', 'charged', 'woman', 'crime', 'alcohol', 'rights', 'say', 'court', 'drink', 'violence', 'drinking', 'women', 'pregnant', 'case']","London: A British court is to rule on whether a woman committed a ""crime of violence"" against her child by drinking heavily during pregnancy, in a case that has raised concerns about criminalizing mothers.

Loveshhuda movie review: Will leave you with a bad hangover,"The 131 minutes of this film has just been padded up with fancy locations, barrels of alcohol and lots of big wet kisses.",,"Feb 19, 2016, 12:48 pm IST","Rating:

Director: Vaibhav Mishra

Cast: Girish Kumar, Navneet Dhillon, Tisca Chopra

How much can one really drink? A thought I had to ponder over after leaving the ‘Loveshhuda’ screening. Can a person survive after consuming that much alcohol?

Director Vaibhav Mishra and his team might just want to check into an Alcohol Anonymous programme after chugging down bottles of liquor for their film ‘Loveshhuda’. The film features star kid Girish Kumar and marks the debut of former beauty queen Navneet Dhillon. ‘Loveshhuda’ surely raises the bar high for self-proclaimed drunkards.

Gaurav (Girish Kumar), an orphaned boy, is raised single-handedly by his older sister Garima (Tisca Chopra). ‘Loveshhuda’ starts with Gaurav’s grand bachelor party as he is all set to tie the knot with Vandana, an irritating, annoying and controlling posh NRI girl, who has been handpicked by his sister Garima. Gaurav and his spoilt gang start his bachelor party with gallons of alcohol and a bevy of beauties. Incidentally, Gaurav meets Pooja (Navneet Dhillon) and spends his entire night drinking and touring London with her and what happens next is very obvious- a drunken one night stand! The two develop feelings for each other but Gaurav lets go of his feelings for Pooja and marries Vandana for his family.

Four years later, Gaurav separates with Vandana and guess what, he meets his drunken ladylove in Mauritius again, where she has come to celebrate her spinster party. With the most cliché events of every love story, Pooja rejects her would be husband Vinayak and goes back to her drunkard boyfriend Gaurav.

I was off alcohol for a while but it seems like ‘Loveshhuda’ gave me a bad hangover. Shot in exotic locations of London and Mauritius, the film is just a travel guide to expensive party destinations that require a lot of alcohol to enjoy your stay there. Director Viabhav Mishra must have instructed his entire crew to work only after getting drunk else they won’t be allowed to come on the sets. Vaibhav smartly mouthed ‘Loveshhuda’ to be a “different film” but looks like he hasn’t seen ‘Yeh Jawani Hai Diwani’ and ‘Love Aaj Kal’ or may be he has and trying to remake these in his own way.

Girish Kumar, who debuted with his home production ‘Ramaiya Vastavaiya’ assures us that he can’t perform. In all of the film’s emotional scenes he is seen concentrating on his drinks rather than on his expressions. He dances really well but I guess it would come naturally to anyone who has downed as much alcohol as he has. Navneet Dhillon, who looks impressive in her styling and expressions sails through till the climax (all thanks to her voice dubbing I believe). Tisca Chopra, Navneet Kasturia and Sachin Khedekar are good enough with their performances.

Being a Tips Production film, ‘Loveshhuda’ surely has good music. From the peppy dance numbers to Atif Aslam’s break up song ‘Mar Jayein’, the soundtracks are ear soothing.

The 131 minutes of this film has just been padded up with fancy locations, barrels of alcohol and lots of big wet kisses. Looking for anything more in this film, is like finding old wine in a new bottle. I believe that the entire budget must have been spent on expensive brands of alcohol. From bachelor parties to an expected climax, alcohol travels in every frame. It is the true hero in the film in every possible manner!

‘Loveshhuda’ should have been titled, ‘Daarushhuda’. First half is with mixed with water and soda but second half is just about having neat pegs. I recommend that you carry a strip of disprin atleast for the second half.","['bad', 'vaibhav', 'film', 'alcohol', 'loveshhuda', 'kumar', 'vandana', 'review', 'movie', 'hangover', 'gaurav', 'leave', 'navneet', 'party', 'dhillon']","Rating:Director: Vaibhav MishraCast: Girish Kumar, Navneet Dhillon, Tisca ChopraHow much can one really drink?

‘We began to run’: Students describe horror of Oregon shooting,At least nine people were killed and seven others wounded on Thursday,,"Oct 3, 2015, 4:00 pm IST","Roseburg: When a 26-year-old man armed with multiple guns walked into a morning writing class in rural Oregon, and opened fire, the students at the community college had no clue what was hitting them - bullets! One witness said the attacker demanded to know students’ religion before shooting them. Students in a classroom next door heard several shots, one right after the next, and their teacher told them to leave.

“We began to run,” student Hannah Miles said. “A lot of my classmates were going every which way. We started to run to the center of campus. And I turned around, and I saw students pouring out of the building.”

At least nine people were killed and seven others wounded on Thursday, the fourth day of classes at Umpqua Community College in this former timber town 180 miles south of Portland. The worst mass shooting in recent Oregon history was raising questions about security at the college with about 3,000 students.

“I suspect this is going to start a discussion across the country about how community colleges prepare themselves for events like this,” former college president Joe Olson said.

The killer was identified as Chris Harper Mercer, according to a government official who was not authorized to speak publicly and provided the name on condition of anonymity. Mercer died after a shootout with police, who were not saying whether they knew of any motive.

He had body armor and was armed with three pistols, a rifle and five additional magazines, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said in an incident report obtained by The Associated Press. The guns included a 9mm Glock pistol and .40-caliber Smith & Wesson, both traced to the suspect. He also had a .40-caliber Taurus pistol traced to someone in Portland and a .556-caliber Del-Ton.

Mercer is not believed to have a criminal history. Investigators believe he may have been a student at the college because a receipt found at the scene showed he purchased textbooks from the campus bookstore two days before the shooting.

He lived in an apartment complex in nearby Winchester, where investigators found a number of firearms, Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin said on Friday. Details about the number and type of guns would be released later, he said.

A neighbor, Bronte Harte, told The Associated Press that Mercer “seemed really unfriendly” and would “sit by himself in the dark in the balcony with this little light.” Harte said a woman she believed to be Mercer’s mother also lived upstairs and was “crying her eyes out” on Thursday.

Social profiles linked to Mercer suggested he was fascinated by the IRA, frustrated by traditional organized religion and tracked other mass shootings. There didn’t seem to be many recent connections on the social media sites linked to Mercer, with his MySpace page just showing two friends. In addition to the MySpace page, Mercer appeared to have at least one online dating profile, a torrents streaming account and a blog.

On a torrents streaming site and blog that appeared to belong to Mercer, posts referenced multiple shootings and downloads included several horror films and a documentary on a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. A blog post urged readers to watch the online footage of Vester Flanagan shooting two former colleagues on live TV in Virginia, while another lamented materialism as preventing spiritual development.

A MySpace page that appeared to belong to Mercer included several photos and graphics of the Irish Republican Army as well as a picture of Mercer holding a rifle.

Mercer previously lived in the Los Angeles-area suburb of Torrance with his mother. Neighbors there recalled him as uncommunicative.

His father, Ian Mercer, said late on Thursday that it’s been a “devastating day” for him and his family, and he has been talking to police and the FBI about the shooting. He spoke to KABC-TV and several other media outlets gathered outside his house in Tarzana, California.

Step-sister Carmen Nesnick said the shooting didn’t make sense.

“All he ever did was put everyone before himself, he wanted everyone to be happy,” she told KCBS-TV.

Hanlin, the sheriff, said on Thursday that he was not going to say the shooter’s name because that’s what he would have wanted.

“I will not name the shooter. I will not give him the credit he probably sought prior to this horrific and cowardly act,” said a visibly angry Hanlin.

Hundreds went to a candlelight vigil on Thursday night, with many raising candles as the hymn “Amazing Grace” was played.

Sam Sherman, a former student, said the school helped broaden his opportunities.

“That’s all I could think about today. There’s 10, 9 kids who won’t get those doors opened,” he said.

Roseburg is in Douglas County, a politically conservative region west of the Cascade Range where people like to hunt and fish. But it’s no stranger to school gun violence. A freshman at the local high school shot and wounded a fellow student in 2006.

After Thursday’s shooting, anguished parents and other relatives rushed to surviving students. Jessica Chandler was desperately seeking information about her 18-year-old daughter, Rebecka Carnes.

“I don’t know where she is. I don’t know if she’s wounded,” Chandler said.

Carnes’ best friend told Chandler that her daughter had been flown by helicopter to a hospital. Students described utter fear and panic after hearing the shots.

Sarah Cobb, 17, was in a next-door classroom. She heard a shot. A teacher said they needed to get out, and the class ran out the door as she heard two more shots.

“I was freaking out. I didn’t know what to think, what to do,” she said.

Before the Roseburg shooting, a posting on the message-board site 4chan included a photo of a crudely drawn frog used regularly in Internet memes with a gun and warned other users not to go to school on Thursday in the Northwest.

The messages that followed spoke of mass shootings, with some egging on and even offering tips to the original poster. It was unclear if the messages were tied to the shooting because of the largely anonymous nature of the site.

Investigators went door to door in the neighborhoods near the college and the shooter’s apartment seeking clues, Hanlin said on Friday.

The sheriff has been vocal in opposing state and federal gun-control legislation. In 2013, Hanlin sent a letter to Vice President Joe Biden after the shooting at a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school, declaring that he and his deputies would refuse to enforce new gun-control restrictions “offending the constitutional rights of my citizens.”","['horror', 'college', 'school', 'run', 'students', 'shooting', 'began', 'mercer', 'know', 'included', 'oregon', 'mass', 'told', 'student']","One witness said the attacker demanded to know students’ religion before shooting them.

HCU Suicide: UoH interim V-C booed away from protest site,The V-C arrived at the spot when it was lunch break and few students were present at the protest site.,,"Jan 28, 2016, 1:19 am IST","Hyderabad: The unwise decision of the interim vice-chancellor, Vipin Srivastava to visit the protest site created tension in the UoH as students started shouting slogans. Police and security personnel took the V-C away.

A few hours before that, the protesters had marched towards the official quarters of Mr Srivastava.

The V-C arrived at the spot when it was lunch break and few students were present at the protest site. He walked towards the stage, where a student and Meena Kandaswami were sitting on hunger strike.

When he attempted to speak to them, other agitators started shouting ‘VC go back’ till he left. Tension mounted when a minor scuffle broke out between students and security officials during the chaos.

Responding, Mr Srivastava said that his intention was to amicably settle the matter and resume classes.

He said that the protest will ruin students career. Asked about the content of the new MHRD report, which held the university administration responsible for the death and unrest in UoH, he said he had not seen the report.

“The university administration never acted on the orders of the BJP. We were acting independently on the power entrusted with us,” he said, talking about the suspension.

Meanwhile, the JAC called Mr Srivastava a murderer, who engineered the killing of two Dalit students.

“He was behind the institutional murder of Dalit PhD student Senthil Kumar in 2008. Now, he is the one who suspended Rohith and others. We will continue our protest till he steps down,” said JAC member Arpita.

Earlier, tension prevailed in front of UoH campus with students holding a road-block on Old Mumbai highway demanding the suspension of the V-C and interim V-C over the suicide Rohith Vemula.

Hundreds of students gathered on the highway and blocked the road demanding justice. Gachibowli inspector, J. Ramesh and his team persuaded the protesters and sent them inside the campus.

As it was peak hour, a huge traffic jam occurred from Kondapur village to Serilingampally MRO office. The students’ JAC burnt effigies of V-C Appa Rao and Union minister Smriti Irani.

The student’s union also demanded that the EC intervene and remove the interim V-C.

Protesters force closure of UoH reading room; ABVP alleges abuse

Protesters closed down the UoH reading room on Wednesday, a day after it was opened. Students vacated the room after JAC members asked them to close it down.

A student wanting to remain anonymous associated with ABVP alleged that the protesters abused them and vacated the room. However, JAC members said that they asked the students only to cooperate with them.

ABVP students demanded that the varsity should resume and open the reading room and library.

The protesters said that they closed down the room because the JAC had called a bandh. “Yesterday the reading room was opened. We did not do anything. But today we had given a bandh call, so we requested students to cooperate with us,” said a JAC member.

“We understand the students concerns. But we need to continue the struggle till our demands are met,” he added. The reading room is likely to be opened from Thursday.

Meanwhile, it was reported that a few people inside the room were outside students and alumni, who use the facility to prepare for exams, when the agitators came to close it.","['interim', 'hcu', 'site', 'suicide', 'away', 'reading', 'protesters', 'booed', 'students', 'tension', 'room', 'vc', 'till', 'jac', 'uoh', 'protest']","Hyderabad: The unwise decision of the interim vice-chancellor, Vipin Srivastava to visit the protest site created tension in the UoH as students started shouting slogans.

Chandigarh: The Punjab government has beefed up security and imposed Section 144 in the state in the wake of the verdict in a 14 year-old rape case against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh.

In a tweet, Gurmeet confirmed that he will appear in court on Friday for hearing in the case.

High alert has been sounded in Ludhiana and ACP G Singh appealed to the public to maintain peace. He said strict action will be taken against those who try to create trouble.

Buses will not ply from depots in Bathinda, Budhlada, Sangrur and Barnala on Thursday and Friday.

Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh's office has also issued a statement, mentioning that a complete ban has been issued on carrying of firearms until the situation normalises.

The chief minister has also ordered withdrawal of 1,000 police personnel from VVIP security for deployment on field to strengthen the security blanket in the state.

The Centre has sanctioned an additional 10 companies of paramilitary forces to maintain law and order in the state.

A number of followers of Gurmeet have started congregating at Panchkula where a CBI court will pronounce its final verdict in the case on Friday.

Followers of Gurmeet said, ""Our Guru can never do wrong, we support him. We will remain calm until the verdict comes.""

Other follower extended his support to Gurmeet and said, ""We are with Guru Ji, we have full faith in God that judgement will be in our favor.""

Security forces in Haryana and Punjab have been taking out flag marches at many sensitive places. Haryana government has already clamped prohibitory orders in all its districts as a precautionary measure.
