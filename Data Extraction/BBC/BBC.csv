Every university 'needs' Alcoholics Anonymous meetings,Alcoholics Anonymous says the number of younger people attending their meetings is on the increase.,[],None,"Image copyright Getty Images

Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings should take place in universities across the UK, student leaders have said.

Charity AA says the number of younger people attending their meetings is on the increase.

NUS Wales president Gwyneth Sweatman said Cardiff University's sessions for problem drinkers, one of the first of its kind, have made a big difference.

One student said the help she received turned her life around.

Cardiff undergraduate ""Marie"" said alcohol pushed her life at university to the edge.

At her lowest ebb, she drank 15 pints of cider a day, was arrested and risked being kicked off her course.

She said: ""It was affecting my work significantly.

""I wasn't concentrating in meetings, I couldn't focus, I was erratic in my behaviour and my decisions.""

""I wasn't turning up, it was having a really negative effect on my mental health and that was spiralling, really awful anxiety and depression and suicide-based thoughts.""

The latest official data suggest young people are drinking less.

However, Dr Mani Mehdikhani, a trustee at Alcoholics Anonymous, said the number of younger attendees at meetings was on the up.

""Looking at our own internal AA surveys that we conduct every five years, every time a survey is undertaken we have increasingly larger numbers of younger people coming as new-comers to AA.

""The last survey in 2015, about 33% of our newcomers were under 40 and I'm sure a big percentage were in the university student-age group.""

Cardiff University also has a student counselling and a well-being team which provides support for ""some of the underlying difficulties associated with, or directly linked to, alcohol misuse"".

Jennifer Kent, a vice president at the union, said: ""For us it feels like a really good way of integrating the students and the community here, and it's also important that, by bringing it here, the students don't feel stigmatised.""

NUS Wales president, Gwyneth Sweatman said she thought the AA meetings idea was ""absolutely brilliant"", and one which she would ""love"" to see replicated across the UK - similar to the United States, where college campaigns AA meetings are more common.","['student', 'anonymous', 'meetings', 'alcoholics', 'younger', 'universitys', 'really', 'wasnt', 'aa', 'wales', 'needs', 'university', 'president']","Image copyright Getty ImagesAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings should take place in universities across the UK, student leaders have said.

Alcoholics Anonymous was founded 80 years ago. It has spawned a host of other groups dealing with every manner of compulsion, writes Chris Stokel-Walker.

""My name is Peter and I'm an alcoholic.""

It's a familiar phrase even to those who have never attended a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous. When Peter introduces himself to 40 others in a small room just off Newcastle's main shopping thoroughfare, on a sunny Saturday morning, he receives a warm welcome back in unison.

Everyone here shares a drink dependency, though they come from hugely different walks of life. The format of the meeting is simple - an introduction, a reading, one member explaining their story, then a free-for-all discussion for others to share their concerns, their triumphs, and their thoughts.

Peter began to drink at the age of 11. ""By the age of legal drinking in the UK I was being admitted to local alcoholic units; in and out of doctors; in and out of police cells. Everything in my life really deteriorated."" But Peter hasn't tasted alcohol in 34 years, and he attributes his sobriety to Alcoholics Anonymous.

All members talk about ""working through the 12 steps"" that form the cornerstone of the programme. The first of the steps, published four years after AA began, reads: ""We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable.""

The 12 steps outline a plan of recovery to overcome addiction, which involves submitting to a higher spiritual power and admitting that alcoholism is an ongoing problem. Founded by Bill Wilson and Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio, AA grew out of a Christian organisation - the Oxford Group.

Image copyright ALAMY Image caption The 12-step recovery programme for Narcotics Anonymous are the same for AA

The group is marking 80 years from the moment Wilson helped Smith - 10 June 1935 was the latter's last drink. That social element of AA, the importance of ""sponsors"" in the process, is as well known as any of the steps.

Today, there are 115,326 Alcoholics Anonymous groups in 175 different countries, according to the group's latest estimates, with more than two million members. There are 60,143 groups in the United States alone.

According to a study in 1998, 90% of private substance abuse treatment centres based in the US model their treatment on the 12 steps. The principles have provided a basis for other 12-steps groups with no affiliation to mainstream AA.

THE 12 STEPS

We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable

Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity

Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him

Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves

Admitted to God, to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs

Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character

Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings

Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all

Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others

Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it

Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out

Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs

These include Narcotics Anonymous, the more specific Marijuana Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Workaholics Anonymous and Sexaholics Anonymous.

Clutterers Anonymous deals with those with hoarding problems. Underearners Anonymous offers support for those suffering an ""inability to provide for one's needs"". Support for loved ones of those going through addiction is on offer at Families Anonymous.

On Monday alone there were four Narcotics Anonymous meetings in Manchester, a Marijuana Anonymous meeting in Fitzrovia, central London, and an Overeaters Anonymous session in Cannock. For some of the smaller groups, if there's no dedicated meeting available, addicts are advised to go to AA as a substitute.

Across England, Wales and Scotland, 687 different Alcoholics Anonymous meetings took place on Monday, with 113 chapters coming together in London alone.

""If you look at any 12-step programme, the only significant difference really is the first part of the first step,"" says Peter, who attends AA meetings and organises Emotions Anonymous meetings in the North East of England.

The latter group deals with issues as diverse as low self-esteem, resentment, fear, anger, indecision, perfectionism, forgiveness, depression, grief, shame and anxiety.

""I think there's a fellowship for every particular human condition,"" Peter jokes. ""But I can understand that, because apart from the first part of the first step, the rest of the programme is a programme for living.""

Image copyright Other Image caption AA meeting depicted in the House of Cards

Most fellowships offer Skype sessions, where you'll be greeted in the same way, any hour of the day by welcoming peers always happy to listen, and you'll say the same words: ""My name is… and I'm addicted to …""

""The 12 steps are very applicable to any other addiction,"" says Amy Krentzman of the University of Minnesota's School of Social Work, who has conducted research into Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programmes.

""They modify the language, but it's the same basic programme, the same basic steps, and other people have got well from following them.""

The ""helper"" theory, first coined in the 1960s, helps explain AA's efficacy, says Krentzman. The helper ends up feeling better too. Most, if not all, of those running 12-step groups are themselves undergoing treatment for addiction.

In countless movies and TV shows - from the Sopranos to Mad Men to House of Cards to the West Wing - the sponsor-addict relationship crops up. Sponsors act as a spiritual, emotional and practical guide.

Treatment is always ongoing in AA, unlike some other traditional rehabilitation programmes which offer short programmes followed by the addict coping largely alone.

Marijuana Anonymous has ""exactly the same format"", explains Thomas, a member. ""It has the 12 steps, and various stories that illustrate the practical application of those steps, and stories from people who have gone through the experience and gone sober.""

These spin-off groups are not explicitly endorsed by Alcoholics Anonymous World Services (AAWS), which oversees the organisation's copyrights. But AAWS does grant permission for groups to use the 12 steps.

And AA's principles are still regularly criticised. Some dislike the quasi-religious element, others the emphasis on complete abstinence rather than the possibility of moderate consumption. There's also a new film - The 13th Step - about sexual assaults carried out by AA members on other members.

But perhaps the greatest criticism is from those who want concrete evidence that this widely accepted programme actually produces results.

""The evidence is that it works very well for some people,"" says Krentzman. A review of scientific studies of Alcoholics Anonymous' success in aiding sobriety in 2006 found that ""no experimental studies unequivocally demonstrated the effectiveness of AA"".

Dr Lance Dodes, a former substance abuse treatment specialist, wrote in a book about 12-step programmes that: ""Alcoholics Anonymous was proclaimed the correct treatment for alcoholism over 75 years ago despite the absence of any scientific evidence of the approach's efficacy, and we have been on the wrong path ever since.""

Another bone of contention is that porting across the 12-step programme to other areas offers cultural legitimacy to the idea of a wide range of compulsions as addictive diseases.

Scientists continue to be divided over whether food addiction really exists. They are torn as to whether sex addiction is real or not. It does not, for example, appear in the American Psychiatric Association's list of mental disorders.

But for many, the programme is effective. Krentzman notes: ""It works because of a psychological process, a social process, a spiritual process. Because of the way it gives people a sense of community and knowing other people who have the same problem.""

That's something Jennifer, who attends Overeaters Anonymous, agrees with. She joined the group in 2008, when she was 37 years old and 17-and-a-half stone. Today, she is at a more manageable weight, and attributes that to her ongoing relationship with the fellowship of overeaters.

""When I'd been to therapists and they were telling me to try things, they had no experience of it themselves,"" she says. ""There's something about one addict helping another addict. There was an authenticity to what they were saying.""

""It's a very simple programme for complicated people,"" Thomas says, ""and it seems to withstand a lot of questioning from outside and within, which can't be said for a lot of rehab philosophies.""

In the AA meeting in Newcastle, 40 people sit and share stories of addiction. Aftewards, there are firm handshakes and friendly conversations - smiles and shared jokes.

One by one, they file out the door into the crowds toting shopping bags, looking like anyone else. But in their mind, they carry an extra weight with them throughout the week.

What happens in an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting?,"Members of Alcoholics Anonymous are marking its 75th anniversary, but what really goes on inside the group's meetings?","['Finlo Rohrer', 'Bbc News']",None,"Image caption The true nature of alcoholism is a controversial subject

Members of Alcoholics Anonymous are marking its 75th anniversary, but what really goes on inside the group's meetings?

David looks, in a word, respectable.

Bespectacled, and in a polo shirt and khaki shorts, he could be any respectable middle-aged man.

He sits in a circle of other respectable-looking people in a church hall in a well-to-do part of Washington. Without knowing the context, as he prepares to speak, one might guess that this was a heritage group, ready to save a historic warehouse, or a meeting of concerned residents, demanding traffic-calming measures.

Instead, when David opens his mouth, he starts to talk about his first use of drugs at the age of 12.

Later he talks about his conscious decision to drink himself to death.

Easy eloquence

There is the revelation of small-time drug smuggling trips to South America and a life of profound lows.

But he has an easy eloquence.

""I have fond memories of the moronic quality of being drunk,"" he says.

People do feel shame and guilt when they do things that are bad - in AA you learn to be shameless and guiltless Jack Trimpey , Rational Recovery

""My story is getting far away mentally. It is almost like the Peloponnesian War now.""

The others in the group also speak enthusiastically, talking of trials and tribulations, of their relationship to drink and how they came to be part of AA.

One gum-chewing, room-dominating woman contrasts life as a high-powered sober Washingtonian with her previous pre-AA life in a series of expansive arm gestures. Another man quietly and movingly recounts his son's troubles with the law.

It's impossible to say whether these individuals were always raconteurs or whether their storytelling matured as they took the 12 Steps.

'Higher power'

Certain lines provoke laughter in the group.

""The only thing I knew for sure about my problem was it wasn't a drinking problem,"" deadpans one man. ""I knew you had to drink too much to have a drinking problem and I could never drink enough.""

Image caption The AA dates its foundation to its co-founder's last drink

There are other phrases that are reverentially repeated. Life became ""unmanageable"" and a ""higher power"" has been at work.

A 70-year-old salesman talks about a life where money was made in computers but years were lost to vodka.

A woman talks of her travels and a reassuring fact. ""There are rooms like this all over the world where crazy people get to talk.""

Of the 11 men and three women in the room, eight have been sober for more than 20 years.

And their meeting is in a long tradition that stretches back to 10 June 1935, to the day Robert Smith - better known as Dr Bob - had his last drink. He had been working with AA co-founder Bill Wilson, now usually referred to as Bill W.

Fictional depictions

The organisation they created has helped millions give up drinking and rebuild their lives.

And the meetings, with the 12-Step Programme that is at the heart of AA, are familiar even to those who have had nothing to do with the group.

The higher power is not just the god of your understanding it is the people in the room Stan, Recovering alcoholic

Countless depictions on film and television have familiarised people with what goes on at the meetings and the familiar formulation ""I'm X and I'm an alcoholic"".

The organisation has its critics. There are those who disagree with the founding idea that alcoholism is a disease, a compulsion that the individual can do nothing about.

Others dislike the Christian nature of the group. The 12 Steps talk of God ""as you understood him"".

Jack Trimpey, who runs his own programme Rational Recovery, is a trenchant critic.

""We do object that it is a bad religion, one in which people profess powerlessness against their bodily desires. We are not powerless. We have a moral duty to cease and desist once it is shown.

""It has been a massive inversion of public thinking that has entered the mainstream media.

""People do feel shame and guilt when they do things that are bad. In AA you learn to be shameless and guiltless.""

He prefers to call himself a former ""bad drunk"" and speaks of an alternative approach that calls for ""zero tolerance in the family"".

Having been sober for many year, he dislikes the typical AA attitude towards that.

""It's not an accomplishment - common decency is no accomplishment.""

Image caption Concerns about binge drinking are now common to much of the world

But for the people at the AA meetings, common decency - and everything else good in life - is an accomplishment.

Jonathan speaks of the single day in 1987 when he first had a moment of happiness. And he knows how it must be maintained.

""I pray and I meditate, and I couple that with working with other alcoholics.""

People at the group seem to have no problem with the varied application of the religious element of AA. There are atheist and agnostic groups, but it's hard to get away from the references to God in the 12 Steps that are at the heart of AA.

The softly-spoken Stan explains: ""The higher power is not just the god of your understanding, it is the people in the room.""

And those other people are the key, one woman admits.

""It works because everything I attempted to do about drinking by myself never worked.

""By coming into AA I was able to get support to not drink - people who think exactly like me, that common bond.""

Sir Anthony Hopkins has opened up on his battle with alcoholism, saying he ""should have died in Wales, drunk or something like that"".

The Oscar-winning star admitted he was ""very difficult to work with"" early in his stage career because he ""was usually hungover"".

He said he turned his life around following a talk with a woman from Alcoholics Anonymous in 1975.

Sir Anthony, 80, was born in Port Talbot but now lives in Los Angeles.

Speaking to about 500 students at the University Of California, the Silence Of The Lambs star discussed his problems with alcohol and the impact it had on his early career.

He said: ""Because that's what you do in theatre, you drink. But I was very difficult to work with, as well, because I was usually hungover.""

Sir Anthony added he had been ""disgusted, busted and not to be trusted"" while he was drinking.

The actor told how he started to change following the talk with the Alcoholics Anonymous woman, who asked him ""why don't you just trust in God?"".

From then on the urge to drink was ""never to return"", he added.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sir Anthony - pictured with Dame Diana Rigg in 1972 - said alcohol affected his early career

Sir Anthony, who was knighted in 1993 for services to the arts, said he got into acting ""because he had nothing better to do"", adding he was ""not at all bright"" in school and was often bullied.

""I believe that we are capable of so much,"" he told the students at the 11th annual Leap, Leadership, Excellence and Accelerating Your Potential conference.

""From my own life, I still cannot believe that my life is what it is because I should have died in Wales, drunk or something like that.""

He now lives in Malibu with his actress wife, Stella Arroyave, and advised students to ""say yes to everything. Say yes and take the risk"".

Sir Anthony is widely considered to be one of the world's greatest living actors and is perhaps best known for his portrayal of cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter in 1991's The Silence Of The Lambs, its sequel Hannibal and prequel Red Dragon.","['alcohol', 'anthony', 'students', 'hopkins', 'image', 'work', 'sir', 'usually', 'yes', 'opens', 'wales', 'early', 'life', 'woman', 'battle']","Image copyright Greg Doherty / Getty Images Image caption Sir Anthony Hopkins shared advice with students at the University Of CaliforniaSir Anthony Hopkins has opened up on his battle with alcoholism, saying he ""should have died in Wales, drunk or something like that"".

UK Punjabi alcohol support services 'see rise in users',The reports follow a BBC survey suggesting 27% of British Sikhs have a family member with a problem.,"['Anusha Kumar', 'Aidan Castelli', 'Ed Lowther', 'Bbc Digital Pilots']",None,"Image copyright Vik Kainth

Some ethnic minority alcohol support services have seen an increase in inquiries following a BBC survey suggesting that, despite Sikhism forbidding drinking, 27% of UK Sikhs had a family member with a problem.

They reported a rise in contacts from both alcoholics and volunteers.

Nottingham's Bac-In has seen an almost sixfold increase in website hits.

And UK Punjabi services the First Step Foundation and the Shanti Project have also seen an increase in interest.

Sohan Sahota, of Bac-In said: ""Average website hits are around 2,000 a month. We've had over 11,500 hits since the article.""

Jaz Rai, director of the First Step Foundation, which works with UK Punjabis across England, said it had doubled the size of its weekly support group and was planning a women-only meeting to address the increased demand.

The Shanti Project, which works to provide culturally appropriate services for the Punjabi community in Birmingham, has also seen an increase.

Tina, a British Punjabi mother-of-two, contacted the BBC after reading its coverage of the issue.

The reports resonated very strongly with her own experiences, she said.

Her husband - a heavy drinker - had been emotionally abusive towards her, Tina said, trying to convince her that she was going mad, and taking out loans in her name to finance his drinking after losing his job as a plumber.

""There's so much going on in Asian families that no-one addresses,"" she said. ""I just want our culture to open up.

""People need to wake up and realise that alcohol is poison,"" she said. ""I don't want my kids to go through what I went through. I don't want my daughter to think that it's normal.""

Sharing stories about addiction can play a key role in the path to recovery, according to Alcoholics Anonymous.

Recovering alcoholic Sanjay Bhandari told the BBC: ""The thing that resonated most with me was to hear other people's stories.

""What they experienced, what it was like, and how things got better gave me hope and inspiration, 'Well I can do that.'""

The BBC's coverage sparked a discussion on social media, involving Sikh MPs, support services, and people directly affected by the issue.

Talking about the issue openly was a good first step towards challenging cultural norms and tackling the problem head on, said Jasvir Singh, on BBC Radio 4's Thought for the Day programme.

""To overcome any fear of shame, it's important to look at alcohol misuse as a health condition and treat it with empathy and understanding rather than condemnation and judgement of the person or their family.""

Eminem celebrates a decade of being sober,The rapper has been clean since the end of 2007.,[],None,"Image copyright Getty Images

Eminem has revealed he's been sober for ten years.

On Saturday, in between headlining Coachella, he posted a photo of himself with an Alcoholics Anonymous coin which signifies sobriety.

""Celebrated my 10 years yesterday,"" the rapper wrote on Instagram - which received more than 1.6 million likes.

Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, was addicted to prescription medication and nearly died of an accidental methadone overdose in 2007.

At the height of his addiction the rapper was reportedly taking up to 20 pills a day.

The 8 Mile actor credits his children for helping him recover and previously revealed he replaced addiction with exercise.

The 45-year-old said running and working out was key to giving him endorphins, which also meant he managed to sleep.

People tweeted him messages of congratulations, including rapper Royce Da 59.

Other people shared their stories of addiction recovery and pictures of their AA coins.

Also known as AA tokens, recovery medallions, sobriety coins or 24 hour chips - they are given out in the US to people during their journey to overcoming addictions.

They bear the circle and triangle symbol used by Alcoholics Anonymous with the words ""unity"", ""service"" and ""recovery"".

On the one Eminem posted on Instagram, the token has the Roman numeral 'X' in the centre of a triangle - which represents 10 years of being sober.

How to tell if you’re a workaholic,There’s a difference between pulling long hours and having an out-of-control urge to work. But where’s the line? Alison Birrane reports,['Alison Birrane'],10/17/2016 0:00,"Everyone loves a hard worker.

In fact, pulling long hours on the job and earning big is considered by many to be the modern mark of success. Being labelled a workaholic is, as often as not, seen as a badge of honour.

But for some, the obsessive need to work comes at the expense of everything else. Health, relationships and even work quality can suffer. It's a high price to pay.

Workaholics are less productive than colleagues with a healthier attitude and approach to work

Whatever the case, a compulsion to work has been leading people to therapists and self-help groups for years. It can even be deadly. Earlier this month, a Japanese government study found one fifth of the Japanese workforce is at risk of death from overwork.

Overwork isn’t just a problem in Japan. Workaholics Anonymous, a 12-step programme which models itself on Alcoholics Anonymous, held its first international conference in the UK in June, with attendees hailing from across the globe.

There has been little research into why workaholism develops. But that’s changing – in recent years, the phenomenon has begun to get more attention and is being treated as more than just a buzzword.

Workaholism is not recognised as a medical condition by the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which is considered the gold standard in diagnosing mental disorders.

Another large-scale study linked workaholic tendencies to other psychiatric issues, like obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety and depression

But even without a precise definition, its impact is being linked to health, workplace and mental issues, and researchers are taking note. A recent meta-analysis – a quantitative summary of the existing research into workaholism – by the University of Georgia showed, among other things, that workaholics are less productive than colleagues with a healthier attitude and approach to work.

Another large-scale study, published in May by the University of Bergen in Norway, linked workaholic tendencies to other psychiatric issues, like obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety and depression.

Not your best work

But when does hard work turn negative? What might lead someone to believe they are a 'work addict'? Well, workaholism is a compulsion – an obsessive and out-of-control urge to work, or think about it, says Bryan Robinson, a psychotherapist based in North Carolina who conducted early research into the effects of work addiction and wrote Chained to the Desk, a guidebook for workaholics.

""Workaholism is not defined by hours. It's defined by what's going on inside of us,” he says.

“A workaholic is someone who's on the ski slopes dreaming about being back at work. A healthy worker is at work, dreaming about being on the ski slopes.”

Robinson, who has counselled people who have divorced, been fired or driven to health crises as a result of chronic overwork, recalls one client who would tell her husband she was at the gym, but instead would go to work before changing into workout clothes and dousing herself in water to make it look like she'd been sweating.

Sound like someone you know?

But workaholics are not necessarily producing the best work or are any more engaged at the office than their colleagues, the University of Georgia meta-analysis found.

Malissa A Clark, an assistant professor of industrial and organisational psychology at the University of Georgia, led the study. She says workaholics reported greater job stress, lower job satisfaction, lower life satisfaction and more burnout.

Warning signs The Bergen Work Addiction Scale uses seven basic criteria to identify work addiction, scored as follows: (1) Never, (2) Rarely, (3) Sometimes, (4) Often, and (5) Always. If you score “often” or “always” on at least four of the seven criteria, you may be a workaholic. You think of how you can free up more time to work.

You spend much more time working than initially intended.

You work in order to reduce feelings of guilt, anxiety, helplessness and depression.

You have been told by others to cut down on work without listening to them.

You become stressed if you are prohibited from working.

You deprioritise hobbies, leisure activities, and exercise because of your work.

You work so much that it has negatively influenced your health

They also reported greater work-life conflict, lower physical and mental health and detrimental outcomes for family, such as marital problems.

“There's not a lot of positive outcomes,” she adds, despite the concept of workaholism often being linked with traits like being driven, competitive, ambitious and productive.

Help in high water

Think you might have a problem? There are a couple of self-assessments you can take.

Norwegian researchers have created the Bergen Work Addiction Scale, where you can gauge your behavior, feelings and attitude towards work. Workaholics Anonymous also has an online questionnaire that can help you determine if you might need to seek help.

The first step, experts say, is to admit you have a problem.

For Robinson, who calls himself a recovering workaholic, treatment involves mindfulness, therapy, behavioural changes and uncovering the underlying issues. “There are root causes to it. Sometimes it's self-esteem, sometimes it's a way to modulate anxiety,” he says.

The drug for workaholics is adrenaline

For Bob, 61, of California, admitting he had a problem came when his wife told him she'd had enough of waking up the middle of the night and discovering him absent, still at the office. Bob – who preferred to use only his first name to preserve the anonymity of the Workaholics Anonymous programme – is now an outreach officer for Workaholics Anonymous, a volunteer position.

“The drug for workaholics is adrenaline,” he says. “Stress, pressure, crisis, deadlines, those all allow the ability get adrenalised and the ability to operate at a frantic pace.”

Bob had his first jobs at five years old – helping his brother deliver newspapers, recycling cans and bottles, mowing lawns and shovelling snow. He became a successful businessman, but ultimately his health suffered, and if he'd not sought help, his family-life would have too, he said. His wife had had enough.

“Her no longer being willing to live like that is what gave me the willingness to finally pursue this programme with some commitment and conviction,” Bob says.

Work, like food, is not something you can just give up cold turkey

But work, like food, is not something you can just give up cold turkey. So how can you control your impulse to work incessantly? “It's having a plan and following a plan, versus, compulsively diving in to whatever pops up,” says Bob. That means scheduling work hours, focusing on one thing at time, and if something unexpected arises, rather than chaotically trying to cram everything in and multi-tasking, going back to your list and reprioritising.

Other treatment options include finding a therapist who is versed in this area. Or, you can attend outpatient workshops and programmes. And, now inpatient residential programmes, such as that offered by The Bridge To Recovery, located in Ohio in the US, are offering help for workaholics alongside other treatments for obsessive or compulsive behaviours, anxiety and depression.

But a big factor in the lack of available treatment, says Clark, is lack of research. “There's not a lot of research on how it develops and there's almost no research on the relationship between workaholism and clinical disorders.” The Norwegian study is one of the first.

More research is needed, she says, “so it becomes more mainstream rather than this fringe topic buzzword that people throw out there. It does have legitimate detrimental outcomes to people's lives and people's well-being.”

Should there be a word for an 'almost alcoholic'?,"Everybody thinks they know what an ""alcoholic"" is, but what about those who drink too much but fall short of the common definitions of alcoholism?","['Olivia Sorrel-Dejerine', 'Bbc News Magazine']",None,"Image copyright Thinkstock

Everybody thinks they know what an ""alcoholic"" is, but what about those who drink too much but fall short of the common definitions of alcoholism? Should there be a word that bridges the gap between alcoholic and non-alcoholic?

The term alcoholic - on its own to denote someone addicted to alcohol - was first used in 1852 in the Scottish Temperance Review.

Since then, millions of heavy drinkers have been confronted by friends and families with the stark question: ""Are you an alcoholic?""

And millions have denied it. Rejected the label. Confessed only to maybe, possibly drinking too much. But utterly denied the A-word.

Alcoholics are people who fall asleep in skips. Alcoholics get into fights. Alcoholics start the day with a shot of whisky. Alcoholics are drunk all the time. Alcoholics can't hold down jobs.

None of the above is necessarily true, but the intensely negative nature of the word alcoholic leaves some people scrabbling for an alternative.

""There is so much stigma,"" says Kate, author of the blog The Sober Journalist. People are so frightened of it - their head fills with images of men drinking under bridges. ""There is this huge number of people out there who don't fit that stereotype but perhaps their drinking isn't quite normal.""

Warning signs Image copyright Getty Images In their book Almost Alcoholic, Robert Doyle and Joseph Nowinski identify five signs that someone may be an ""almost alcoholic"": You continue to drink despite at least some negative consequences

You look forward to drinking.

You drink alone.

You sometimes drink in order to control emotional and/or physical symptoms.

You and your loved ones are suffering as a result of your drinking

Kate went to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings when she started to think she was drinking too much, about four or five years ago. ""I felt I was out of place, I wasn't alcoholic enough. I felt that everyone else had worse problems with drinking than I did,"" she says.

There are other words for people who drink a lot. There is everything from the lightly derogatory ""lush"" to the more flowery ""bibulous"" to the prosaic ""heavy drinker"".

But there is nothing as succinct as alcoholic. And some believe that this gap has an effect.

Professionals have started using other terms that would not be as negative as alcoholic because ""many doctors feel that it is quite difficult to engage a patient if you talk to them about alcoholism"", says Dr Sarah Jarvis, a consultant for Patient.co.uk.

People have such vivid mental images of what it means to be an alcoholic that they measure themselves against that standard and do not seek help.

""They all have an idea of what an alcohol or problem drinker is but there is a different pattern for every drinker,"" Jarvis says.

Not all experts share this view, however.

There's a danger that avoiding the term ""alcoholism"" will only serve ""to reassure people their drinking is OK when it isn't"", says Moira Plant, emeritus professor of alcohol studies at the University of the West of England.

Image copyright Hulton Archive Image caption The term inebriate was popular in the 19th Century

She agrees the widespread impression of the alcoholic as a vagrant or street-drinker prevents higher-functioning people with drink problems from seeking help. But she says the best way to tackle this is to correct false stereotypes, not downplay the situation faced by such individuals - many of whom are already in denial.

""People normalise heavy drinking,"" she says. ""They tend to overestimate what everyone else drinks. They say, 'I don't drink as much as my friends so it's OK.'""

There have been other words to describe someone drinking too much. In the 19th Century ""inebriate"" was a popular term and the word ""drunkard"" goes all the way back to the 15th Century.

England's Department of Health recommends that men should not regularly drink more than three to four units of alcohol a day and women should not regularly drink more than two to three units a day.

But drinking above these recommendations does not necessarily mean that the person is an alcoholic. It just means increased risk of health damage.

""An alcoholic is anyone who is dependent on alcohol and who is drinking to a level that will endanger their health,"" Dr Jarvis says.

The term alcoholic is very much alive in the vocabulary of ordinary people, says Tim Leighton, director of professional education and research at Action on Addiction.

""In Europe and in the UK, there was a move away from the term in the 1960s; it was seen as derogatory. We now talk about 'alcohol dependence', but you don't hear people in the street saying he is an 'alcohol dependent,' they say he is an 'alcoholic,'"" he says.

Dr Jarvis says it is a shame the words ""hazardous"" or ""harmful"" drinker aren't used more widely.

The issue with the use of the word ""alcoholic"" is that it is narrow. ""You are either one or you are not,"" Leighton says. ""This is why some people prefer the term 'alcohol dependence'. You can be an alcoholic without drinking too much - it is all about dependence, about losing control.""

For a long time, it was a strict category, there were specific criteria and if you fulfilled these criteria, you were an alcoholic, says Joseph Nowinski, one of the authors of the book Almost Alcoholic.

This is a stage for a lot of controversy - as long as you didn't meet the alcoholic criteria, you would say, ""I am not an alcoholic so I don't have a drinking problem"", he says.

""There has never been a word for people who come to the point of asking themselves the question, 'Do I have a problem or not?'""

Based on this, Nowinski and Robert Doyle came up with the concept of being an ""almost alcoholic"" to describe people who are not alcoholics but who ""fall into a grey area of problem drinking"".

""The almost alcoholic zone is actually quite large. The people who occupy it are not alcoholics. Rather, they are men and women whose drinking habits range from barely qualifying as almost alcoholics to those whose drinking borders on abuse,"" they wrote in the Atlantic.

""An expanded view of drinking behaviour in terms of a spectrum as opposed to discrete categories might be viewed by some as opening the door to over-diagnosing the associated problems. We believe the opposite will prove to be the case: that this paradigm shift will allow people to recognise problems earlier and to seek solutions without having to be labelled as alcoholics.""

""There is a huge range of alcohol problems,"" Leighton says. ""A lot of people with alcohol problems are not alcoholics.""

Until a new label is popularised there will be people who struggle to admit they have a problem, he says.

But for Kate, the existing term has come to make sense as her recovery has progressed.

""I feel that eight months ago I wouldn't have said that I was an alcoholic and now I could say I am because I know what it means,"" she says.

Adrian Chiles 'horrified' at drinking 100 alcohol units a week,The TV and radio broadcaster revealed he sometimes drank more than 100 units a week.,[],None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Presenter Adrian Chiles speaks about alcohol after revealing he sometimes drank 100 units a week.

Presenter Adrian Chiles has urged people to track their alcohol intake after revealing he sometimes drank 80 or 100 units a week.

The BBC 5 live host said it was ""horrifying"" to add up his alcohol consumption, which was well over the recommended weekly 14 units.

He was told by a doctor he ""can't carry on like this"" and his liver damage could cause cirrhosis or death.

Chiles, 51, has tackled the issue of drinking in a new BBC documentary.

Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Chiles said: ""I was just staggered what I was putting away"".

He said most of his drinking was ""completely mundane and harmless"", adding: ""I don't really get drunk, I don't misbehave, I don't drink during the day, I don't drink alone, I don't particularly stay up late.

""I just drink something every day.

""There are loads of us who just drink too much and I just wondered why I was so dependent on it in a small way, or is it a big way.""

Chiles' comments have prompted many people to speak about their own drinking habits. Actress Linda Robson told ITV's Loose Women she thought ""maybe I could have been on the way to being an alcoholic"" when she used to drink a bottle of wine a night.

She said: ""My big thing was because I didn't drink in the daytime then I didn't have a problem and I could make myself wait until that time every night so I obviously didn't have a problem.

""But I was still functioning, I was still coming into work.""

'We are the problem'

Chiles - who sees himself as a social drinker and not an alcoholic - said he wanted to make the programme after being interested in people's ideas of what type of drinking counts as alcoholism.

For the documentary, called Drinkers Like Us, the TV and radio broadcaster recorded how many units he was drinking.

In an interview with the Times, he said on one morning he calculated that he had drunk more than 100 units in the previous week, whereas other times his weekly amount was 80 units.

The NHS advises men and women not to drink more than 14 units a week - equivalent to six pints of average-strength beer or 10 small glasses of wine.

Chiles said people like him - the ""constant drinkers, the toppers up"" - are ""the problem"".

Although his blood tests were completely normal, a scan showed he had mild to moderate fibrosis of the liver - a type of damage that includes scar tissue forming - and significant liver fat.

The doctor told Chiles: ""You can't carry on like this. You're at risk of disease progression to cirrhosis, liver disease and failure - and death.""

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption In his documentary, Chiles is warned by a doctor: ""You can't carry on like this.""

Chiles said it might be easier to ""stop completely"" rather than moderating his drinking, which he said requires planning.

He said: ""I think middle-aged 'supposedly moderate' drinkers need to take a look at ourselves.

""I encourage anyone, don't judge yourself, don't panic you're not going to drop dead, but go on an app like 'Drink Less' and measure what you're drinking, be honest with yourself for three weeks.""

Alcohol dependency: When social drinking becomes a problem,"Alcohol-related health issues among baby boomers are on the rise. Daily drinking can start off as a social event, but turn into dependency and addiction, experts say.","['Melissa Hogenboom', 'Bbc News']",None,"Alcohol-related health issues among baby boomers are on the rise. Daily drinking can start off as a social event but turn into dependency, addiction experts say. So when does social drinking become alcoholism?

In the festive season, with office parties, Christmas, and new year, there is opportunity aplenty for yet another tipple.

Since the 1950s, alcohol consumption in the UK has gradually increased. The NHS now spends more on alcohol-related illness among baby boomers than any other age group, with £825m spent on 55 to 74-year-olds in 2010-11 compared to £64m on under-24s.

Alcohol addiction When someone becomes dependent or addicted to alcohol, they: Develop a strong sense of compulsion to drink

May drink shortly after waking to reduce feelings of alcohol withdrawal

Develop a reduced capacity to control how often and how much they drink

Organise their lifestyle around drinking

Continue to drink despite physical or social problems Source: BBC Health The long-term effects of alcohol

Estimates also suggest about nine per cent of men and three per cent of women in the UK show signs of alcohol dependence.

But it is the functioning alcoholic that can slip under the radar - before their health issues are severe enough to need treatment.

Straight vodka

Dr John Marsden, an alcohol and drug dependency expert from King's College London, says a typical functioning alcoholic can manage to hold down a job despite having a ""very severe drinking problem that they have been incubating over a very long period"".

""Alcohol problems are difficult to understand because they do not occur overnight. They are hidden from view which makes functioning alcoholics a group we cannot easily help.""

Rob C, who is 61, was one of them. At his worst he was drinking 1.5 litres of straight vodka per day.

""Then I began to suffer blackouts, losing whole days and not remembering anything.""

He would be first to arrive at work, which made him able to set out his ""drinks for the day with what looked like a bottle of mineral water"".

""I would hide bottles around the office. You think nobody else knows, that it doesn't smell, that you're getting away with it. But of course they did notice.""

Life saver

For several years, maintaining a full-time finance job, he drank increasingly more during the day.

There was work, there was money and increasingly the motivation to alter ones mood quickly. Alcohol has been the drug of choice to do that Dr John Marsden, Addiction expert

What started as a social pastime nearly cost him his relationship. Now sober for eight years, looking back he says that even if a colleague had said something at the time, he would not have listened.

""I resented the changes at work and told myself I deserved a drink. I would buy wine at lunchtime and drink it from a polystyrene cup.""

Wine turned to vodka for a ""bigger kick"" and lunchtime turned to morning through to night.

Early retirement on medical grounds made his addiction worse. It was only when his partner threatened to kick him out that he sought help with Alcoholics Anonymous, who he says saved his life.

Rob is not alone. In the last decade there has been a 63% increase in prescriptions for the treatment of alcohol dependency in England, as well as a 20% rise in deaths from liver disease.

Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, a liver specialist and chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance, believes the number of people dying from liver disease will keep rising.

The majority of people who have alcohol-related health problems are middle-aged, which Sir Ian says is a consequence of chronic alcohol misuse - many years of frequent heavy drinking, rather than binge drinking - a session of drinking large amounts of alcohol in a small space of time.

But he says that though there is a big overlap, it is important to remember not all heavy social drinkers are dependent on alcohol.

""Some people can control their drinking after work, others can't. If people are frequently drinking harmful levels of alcohol - over 50 units a week for men, 35 for women - most will end up suffering some form of physical, mental or social harm.""

A lifetime's worth of drinking is catching up with baby boomers, says Emily Robinson from the Alcohol Concern.

The charity hopes that their campaign, Dry January, will help get people thinking about how much they drink, especially at home when units are harder to measure, and crucially, before they reach a stage where drinking is affecting their health.

""The issue of people drinking every day is worrying as it's a way of slipping into dependency, as you need to drink a little more each time to feel the same effects,"" she says.

Dr Marsden suggests the line between social drinking and dependency is clear. He says the first question that needs to be asked by clinicians or family members is: ""Has anyone expressed concern to you about your drinking?""

What's a unit? Half a pint of standard strength (4%) beer, cider or lager

A single pub measure of spirit (25ml)

Half a standard glass of wine (175ml) Alcohol units guide

This question assesses whether a person's behaviour has negatively impacted on someone close to them, he adds.

""If your alcohol consumption has caused a problem for someone else - I'm not rushing to label you an alcoholic but suggesting you need to take a closer look at your behaviour.""

There is a clear reason the baby boomer generation is now most at risk from alcohol-related problems, argues Dr Marsden.

A hard-working generation led to an appetite for entertainment and relaxation.

""There was work, there was money and increasingly the motivation to alter one's mood quickly. Alcohol has been the drug of choice to do that.""","['alcohol', 'baby', 'problem', 'dependency', 'drink', 'work', 'drinking', 'social', 'health', 'alcoholrelated', 'problems']","Daily drinking can start off as a social event but turn into dependency, addiction experts say.

Recovering Durham alcoholic starts blog to help others,A recovering alcoholic from Durham is sharing his experiences in beating his addiction in an online blog designed to help others.,[],None,"Image caption Martin Prest drank 83 units in two days

A recovering alcoholic from Durham is sharing his thoughts and experiences in an online blog to help others beat the addiction.

Martin Prest has been sober for 18 months following his daily battle with drink for the past eight years.

He regularly used to drink about 18 pints a day.

He has now set up the informative blog, Open Alcoholic, to catalogue his experience battling alcohol addiction.

""I thought that alcoholism is so difficult sometimes to understand from the outside if you haven't lived it, and after speaking to people over my 18 months sobriety... family members or people who care about them, they can't necessarily understand,"" Mr Prest said.

""They've asked me what it's like and to try an explain this process, this mindset, that they've watched destroy someone and I really wanted to use the website to try and explain it better.""

My entire body was falling apart, I had nothing left in life but the drinking Martin Prest

The 26-year-old uses his blog to explain how he came to terms with his addiction and overcame it, but how it still troubles him.

Mr Prest unknowingly had his first taste of alcohol when he was just seven-years-old.

""It was funny because I didn't know it was alcoholic and I knew I wasn't allowed to drink it,"" he said.

""I started stealing sips of it in the morning when I was seven, it was on a top shelf on a cupboard and I could nip up and get it and have a sip, just because I liked the taste of it, I didn't know what it was or anything.""

Following this early taste his drinking habits became out of control from the age of 18 and he went from being a social drinker to drinking alone and getting drunk.

""I drank until I was drunk and could finally fall asleep, everyday for years. The only time I actually noted down how much I drank was my last weekend drinking,"" he said.

""I knew I was going to stop drinking, I was sort of saying farewell to it and I drank through 83 units in two days, I was drinking mostly bitters and real ale and that's 18 pints and I wasn't drunk - I could still walk straight and I was still holding conversations and stuff, I mean how much I drank when I did get drunk I have no idea, more than that.""

'Spontaneously haemorrhaging'

After years of destroying his body through drink, his health problems became visible.

""My entire body was falling apart, I had nothing left in life but the drinking,"" he said.

""I was spontaneously haemorrhaging, I was bleeding out of my face from the damage that was being done, my head was just exploding in pain constantly my body was just wrecked. I knew I had to stop drinking.""

Mike Scott, a GP in Newcastle, said: ""Liver disease can lose the blood's ability to clot, so therefore you tend to bleed more easily.

""A cut or damage to the skin is arguably going to bleed more with an unhealthy liver.""

Mr Prest, added: ""It's such an insane process because you lose everything and it ruins your life essentially, I mean I've obviously picked back up again but you still want to drink you still want to get drunk, it never ever goes away, it's just engrained in your personality.""

Smashed: Mary Elizabeth Winstead on playing an alcoholic,An independent film about an elementary schoolteacher with a drinking problem has been tipped as a potential awards contender. BBC News speaks to its director and stars.,"['Neil Smith', 'Entertainment', 'Arts Reporter', 'Bbc News']",None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Leading lady Mary Elizabeth Winstead tells the BBC why she took on her most dramatic role to date

A low-budget independent film about an elementary schoolteacher with a drinking problem has been tipped as a potential awards contender. BBC News spoke to its director and stars.

Movie awards voters tend to be impressed by hard-hitting studies of alcoholism, regularly rewarding films that have highlighted the perils of the demon drink.

Ray Milland won an Oscar in 1946 for playing a drunkard in The Lost Weekend, as did Nicolas Cage, 50 years later, for imbibing himself to death in Leaving Las Vegas.

Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne and Jeff Bridges were also given Hollywood's highest accolade for playing characters partial to a tipple.

It can work for actresses too. Elizabeth Taylor received her second Oscar for playing a boozy harridan in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, while Lee Remick got a nomination for going blotto in Days of Wine and Roses.

All of which bodes well for Mary Elizabeth Winstead, whose portrayal of Kate, a young wife trying to stay off the sauce in the independent film Smashed, is being tipped as a dark horse in this year's awards race.

Only last month, she was nominated for a Spirit award, alongside Jennifer Lawrence (from Silver Linings Playbook) and child performer Quvenzhane Wallis (from Beasts of the Southern Wild).

Could an Oscar nomination follow in January? During a visit to London last month, the 28-year-old was studiously playing down her chances.

'Wonderful imagination'

""I'm very aware my chances are not very high so I'm not getting my hopes up,"" says the actress, previously seen in quirky movies like Scott Pilgrim vs The World and Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof.

""But it's lovely to hear anyone say anything like that about a performance I've done, and I certainly can't help but fantasise about the idea of being a part of it in some way.""

""I had seen Mary in big action films like Die Hard 4.0 and the remake of The Thing,"" says Smashed director James Ponsoldt, whose work won a special jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival last January.

Image caption Paul (left) is known to US TV audiences for playing Jesse Pinkman in Breaking Bad

""But spending time with her, I realised what a wonderful imagination she has and how willing she was to really prepare for this role.""

Those sentiments are shared by actor Aaron Paul, who took a break from playing a crystal meth dealer in TV's Breaking Bad to appear as Charlie, Kate's free-spirited, perennially intoxicated husband.

""The goal in this business is to get lost in the scenes and truly feel like you're living moments as if they were your own,"" says the 33-year-old.

""That happened pretty much every day on set with Mary. It was great and a wonderful experience.""

Should accolades come in Smashed's direction, it would be quite a coup for a film shot in just 19 days for a reported $500,000 (£312,557).

Not only that, but it would also surely be the first movie so honoured to feature a teacher publicly relieving herself on a convenience store floor.

For Winstead, used to projecting glamorous self-assurance on red carpets and in photo shoots, fabricating something so indecorous and unladylike must have posed a challenge.

Apparently, though, such considerations were secondary compared to the need to make an artificial bladder function on cue.

'Not propaganda'

""What's funny in scenes like that is that sometimes the technical aspects end up overriding everything else,"" the actress smiles.

""I was wearing this... 'device', and when I sat down I had to put my arm on my leg to activate it.

""And it wasn't working - every take it wasn't working. On every take everyone was behind the camera going, 'Is it going to work?'

""So it really got rid of all of the humiliation of doing that scene, because all the focus was on hoping that it worked and that we could actually get the scene done.""

Winstead's character is driven to seek help from Alcoholics Anonymous, much to the chagrin of her hard-drinking husband.

Image caption The cast of Smashed includes Octavia Spencer (right), who won an Oscar this year for The Help

The film takes a fairly uncritical view of the organisation, which is depicted by Ponsoldt and his co-writer Susan Burke as a benignly tolerant force for social good.

""Susan and I have very complicated feelings towards AA,"" says the director. ""We both know people whose lives have been saved by it, and we know people who left because they thought it was a cult.

""We didn't want to glorify it; this is certainly not a propaganda film. Nor did we want to take easy shots at it.

""We just wanted the scenes at AA to feel honest and true, so we went to great lengths to make sure they were accurate.""

As graphic as Smashed becomes, particularly when Paul and Winstead's characters are at their most inebriated, it is not inconceivable the film could benefit the organisation.

Winstead is happy for it to have a dual purpose, saying it would be ""fantastic"" if the film was ""used in any sort of positive way"".

""People have come up to me after screenings who work with alcoholics and feel it would be a great tool for them to use,"" she says.

""I think the reason they feel that way is it feels more real than other films on the subject, and a lot more relatable to people of this generation.""

'Recovery point'

Smashed is not the only film around at present to have an alcoholic protagonist. Another is Flight, out in the UK in February, in which Denzel Washington plays an airline pilot waging his own battle with the bottle.

Winstead admits it is ""interesting"" for the two to emerge at the same time but insists that they are ""very different films"".

""Smashed is about a person getting their life together, while Flight is about somebody in the throes of alcoholism who can't get to that recovery point,"" she muses.

Image caption Denzel Washington plays a pilot in Flight found to be harbouring a dark secret

""Although they are both anchored and rooted in alcoholism, they tell very different stories.""

""I think it's funny in a quirky, cosmic way that they both came out so close to each other,"" laughs Ponsoldt. ""I just wish we had Flight's marketing budget.

""But I see it as a win for everybody. The world is better when both the independents and studios are making movies for adults that deal with serious issues that pertain to everyone's lives.""

So how does one set about playing an addict? For Aaron Paul, the most effective route to finding his character was also the simplest.

""What I did for research was drink - a lot more than I had ever in my entire life,"" he reveals. ""I filmed myself getting severely intoxicated and I studied the tapes.

""I also went onto YouTube and typed in 'drunk people acting crazy',"" he continues. ""It's incredible what you can find out there.""

Recovery movement helps addicts kick the habit in Liverpool,"How former addicts in Liverpool are trying a new programme to kick the habit, as figures show deaths from alcohol are on the increase.","['Andy Gill', 'Bbc North West Tonight']",None,"Image caption Addicts on the Recovery programme are hoping to kick the habit for good

""Ah boom chikka boom!"" sings the choir leader. ""Ah boom chikka boom! "" sing back the twenty or so members of the choir.

The Raucous Caucus Recovery Chorus is made up mainly of former drug users and alcoholics from Liverpool.

They rehearse in a small room at an addiction charity office and you have to be sober to sing: all members pledge that they've been off drink or drugs for at least 24 hours.

Being in the choir is part of the treatment for these former users, doing something normal like singing with other people.

But the choir has a wider significance as the public face of a new programme in tackling addiction called Recovery - a movement in which Liverpool is playing a leading role.

Rather than manage an addiction with drug substitutes or controlled drinking, people go through detox and then practise total abstinence.

'Animal existence'

Drink-related deaths in the North West are among the highest with men accounting for two-thirds of such deaths in the UK.

And figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the problem is getting worse.

In the Land of Recovery, it's the guinea pigs that wear the white coats. Mark Gilman , NHS Treatment Agency

More people in the UK died from alcohol-related conditions in 2010 than in 2009 with the figure rising by 126 to 8,790 from 8,664.

But to understand why Liverpool is leading the way in this new idea, we need to go back in time.

In the 1980s, it was one of the cities to bear the brunt of a new drug problem - the arrival of brown powder heroin.

Addicts stole to feed their cravings, and transmitted HIV and other infections by using dirty needles.

To cut crime and improve health, Liverpool was one of the first places to pioneer harm reduction treatments.

Users were prescribed methadone to keep them off heroin. It worked, but many people spent years on methadone, and remained addicts.

Raucous Caucus singer Colin used drugs for 22 years, and was on methadone for 17.

""I'd have done anything for my drugs."" he said. ""I lived an animal existence.""

Now, being in the choir is vital for him.

""I love it,"" he said. ""It's really positive for me.""

Children of addicts

The idea of Recovery, of staying off drink and drugs for good, has been around for some time.

Image caption Former addict Colin has been off drugs for two years thanks to the Recovery programme

It started in America, but is now taking hold in the UK.

Liverpool is still a relatively poor city with high unemployment and poor housing which partly explains why drug and drink addiction is so high; there are twelve Alcoholics Anonymous meetings here every week.

It also explains why Liverpool is at the forefront of the movement in England.

Jacquie Johnston-Lynch, of Action on Addiction, said: ""Liverpool has the highest number of [Recovery] Fellowships per head of population in Europe.""

Liverpool was where the UK's first Recovery March took place in 2009 and Action on Addiction has opened an alcohol-free bar called The Brink.

But the idea of ""Recovery"" has sparked furious debate in drug treatment circles.

Some don't like the idea of users taking more responsibility for their own treatment.

Mark Gilman, leader of the NHS Treatment Agency, said: ""In the Land of Recovery, it's the guinea pigs that wear the white coats.""

But Martin says Recovery is important because it could put an end to the problem where the children of addicts become addicts themselves.

""If you get this right, you're the firewall between the intergenerational transfer of addiction,"" he said.

Russia: Government mobile app to help alcoholics,New government app aims to help recovering alcoholics and drug addicts.,"['News Elsewhere...', '...As Found Bbc Monitoring']",None,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Russia has one of the highest alcohol-related mortality rates in the world

The Russian government is trying to tackle the country's notoriously high alcoholism rate with the launch of a free mobile app.

The app will provide information for ""people battling addictions that are very hard to fight"" in order to help them to stay clean, says Yevgeny Bryun, the health ministry's leading narcotics official. He tells the M24 news website that it will offer details of nearby support meetings for recovering alcoholics and drug addicts, medical advice on keeping the problem under control, and access to online radio programmes run by Alcoholics Anonymous.

The app should be up and running next year, but Mr Bryun says other resources are already being made available, including a new radio network for rehabilitation clinics, where ""specialists and alcoholics will talk about recovering"".

Experts are lining up in support of the plan, which they see as a serious attempt to tackle what Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has called Russia's drinking-culture ""national disaster"". ""Information technology can play a very important role here, as you can't change these patients with pills,"" Dr Oleg Zykov, a leading Moscow drugs specialist, tells M24.

Russian men are estimated to drink about 70% more pure alcohol than their American counterparts, and United Nations figures suggest alcohol was the main culprit in 30% of all deaths in Russia in 2012. Government incentives, penalties and price hikes seem to be making little difference. But the ideas keep on coming. In Moscow, a pilot scheme will see the city's health department issue certificates to people who stay clean, and the head of Russia's anti-drugs service has even suggested devoting a television channel to helping people beat their addictions.

BBC Radio Manchester is taking a journey across Greater Manchester's 10 boroughs to meet some of the most inspiring people who live in the region. Here is the latest in the series:

Most recovering alcoholics talk about the moment they hit rock bottom.

Warning signs Image copyright Getty Images In their book Almost Alcoholic, Robert Doyle and Joseph Nowinski identify five signs that someone may be an ""almost alcoholic"": You continue to drink despite at least some negative consequences

You look forward to drinking.

You drink alone.

You sometimes drink in order to control emotional and/or physical symptoms.

You and your loved ones are suffering as a result of your drinking

For Jan, it was when she spent a year in prison for grievous bodily harm after being convicted of glassing a woman in an Alderley Edge bar.

The Stockport mother, who did not want to be identified in order to protect her daughter, says cannot remember anything of the 2008 incident.

At that time Jan was drinking about two bottles of wine a night.

Before then, she says she drank sensibly, in order to wind down from her job as a senior executive for a major oil company.

""I used alcohol as an emotional crutch,"" Jan explained. ""It started off as just a glass of wine after work and it turned into two bottles.

""I'd have cleaned a whole football stadium with a toothbrush if it would tell me why this was happening to me at the age of 40.""

Before being sent to prison she sought treatment for her alcoholism at a private clinic, and was sober when she was behind bars.

While serving her sentence at HMP Styal in Cheshire she helped others who were struggling to cope with life in prison and, as a result, gained a great deal of respect from other inmates.

And since her release she has been helping others battle addiction in Greater Manchester, saying she ""now has a better understanding of herself"".

""And I NEVER think of having a drink.""

Pakistan battles growing alcohol addiction,"Alcoholism is a growing problem in Pakistan despite it being illegal for the Muslim majority to drink, reports the BBC's Charles Haviland.",[],None,"Image caption Pakistan is supposed to be officially ""dry"" because of its Muslim majority

Alcoholism is a growing problem in Pakistan despite it being illegal for the Muslim majority to drink. The BBC's Charles Haviland finds lives ruined and clinics and therapy groups trying to overcome a taboo subject.

Late one night, the beat of dance music drifts down from an upper storey of an apartment block on the edge of a Pakistani city.

Inside the flat, the music is pulsating around a dance floor. There is a bar where a range of liquor is being served and cocktails shaken. Under flashing stroboscopic lights, dozens of people laugh, dance and enjoy the drink.

This is one of the parties that are now commonplace in the cities but are highly discreet.

The liquor is bought illicitly from bootleggers - or from the regular alcohol shops that are supposed to sell only to minorities holding permits but also sell illegally to large numbers of Muslims.

Pakistan even has its own breweries which officially produce only for non-Muslims - or for export.

'Increasing trend'

Image caption Mr Ahmed was formerly an alcoholic and now runs a rehabilitation organisation

The subculture of liquor enjoyment belies Pakistan's status as officially ""dry"". That is, the 96% of Pakistanis who, according to official figures are Muslim, are not supposed to drink.

The penalty if they do so is 80 lashes but it is not strictly enforced.

Although there are many harmless social gatherings, there is also a growing problem of addiction to the bottle.

Officials have told the BBC - while not wanting to be quoted - that alcohol-related diseases have risen by at least 10% in the past five years.

Tahir Ahmed, a former alcoholic who now runs a rehabilitation organisation, Therapy Works, detects ""a visibly increasing trend"". Six years ago, when he started this work, most drinkers were in at least their 20s; now, some are as young as 14, he says.

I would wake up and I would not remember the last two or three days of my life because I was so intoxicated - and that really frightened me Sara, Alcoholic in Lahore

Sometimes alcohol is taken in conjunction with narcotics.

He says alcohol has a much firmer presence in the home - especially for the affluent - and at social occasions like weddings.

And he says that if a Pakistani drinks, it is usually in large quantities because it is, he believes, a response to the massive social pressures here, including the threat of political violence and high unemployment.

""Unfortunately drinking in Pakistan is not recreational,"" he said. ""It's much more escapist and much more relief-seeking. That means drink till the bottle is emptied.""

Now 65, this is the way he himself used to be. He watched two of his friends die of cirrhosis of the liver and nearly died himself.

He decided to stop drinking but went into clinical depression for a year. Only then did he receive therapy, later setting up his organisation, which is registered with Britain's Counselling and Psychotherapy Central Awarding Body.

'Taboo for women'

Drinking among the affluent is especially noticeable. Some senior politicians are rumoured to drink, and alcohol is served at some high-society events, though never on camera.

But it affects everybody. Last month, at least 12 people in Karachi died after drinking toxic home-made liquor.

Some Pakistani alcoholics are women. For them, the stigma is all the greater.

In Pakistan's second city, Lahore, Sara - whose name we have changed - recounts her story.

Five years ago, aged 33 and with two teenage children, she got divorced. Then alcoholism just sucked her in. She would go binge-drinking for days at a time and suffer blackouts.

""I would wake up and I would not remember the last two or three days of my life because I was so intoxicated. And that really frightened me.""

Image caption Mr Umer said a strict and austere regimen helped him overcome drinking

As word got around and she became an embarrassment to her children, Sara wanted to go to a rehabilitation clinic. But being a woman made this very difficult in Pakistan.

""Some men will turn around and say, 'Okay, I have a problem.' But it's a taboo for women. A woman will never stand up and say I have a problem and I need help. That's not acceptable.""

Nine months ago, she finally sought assistance and was able to get medicine and therapy-based help at home, from Therapy Works. Now she is recovering.

In an unregulated medical market, there are other clinics whose approach to treatment is much more strict. The BBC visited one in Karachi, called Willing Ways, where a group of current and former residents were in a session with the doctor who founded the establishment.

Clients are admitted with their families' consent, but they do not always realise they will be confined for three months. While living there, they are deprived of all addictive substances including tobacco, and of all external communications.

One former patient contacted the BBC and said he felt the set-up was excessively draconian.

But a satisfied former client, businessman Yousuf Umer, says the austere regimen worked for him.

""It has changed my life and I am a very successful man now.""

'I'm listening'

Image caption Dr Mamsa, right, conducts a radio show using a mix of English and Urdu

While clinics and therapy-based groups tackle alcoholism, the media is now doing so too.

On Karachi's Radio 1 91 FM a psychiatrist-broadcaster, Dr Faisal Mamsa, takes calls every Thursday and Friday night on all sorts of social taboos - including this one.

""Go ahead. I'm listening,"" he tells callers in soft tones. Sporting a mop of unruly hair and a beard, he wears shorts in the studio.

There follows a conversation in a mix of English and Urdu.

Calls or texts from affected family members are encouraged. A woman says her husband has been drinking for 13 years but she cannot persuade him to seek help. The doctor suggests they contact Alcoholics Anonymous.

The next caller is an addict who admits he is violent.

Dr Mamsa says the anonymity of radio makes it ideal for this subject.

""I'm not concerned about the name,"" he said.

""If they're talking about a problem, it's not just them who's benefiting out of it but whosoever is listening to the radio is listening about it. What matters is that the problem is being discussed.""

There is no chance of Pakistan's legally ""dry"" status changing in the near future. Yet there is an alcoholism problem, which officials and doctors say is growing.

""My daughter told me she didn't like the fact that I always smelt of wine. That was probably the point I thought I may have a problem.""

What started as a few glasses of wine in the evening with her husband quickly developed into full-blown alcoholism for Alice, a mother of one from Birmingham.

She's one of a growing number of women dealing with a drink problem, with recent statistics showing women are nearing equality with men in alcohol consumption.

But as the shame of her addiction eventually forced her to seek help, she found several barriers in her way as a woman and mother seeking treatment.

Her problems with alcohol started at the age of 33 when she married and had a child.

""My then husband used to like popping to the local for one or two drinks before bed. Once our child was born this led onto opening a bottle of wine each evening and this is when the pattern started.

""Over the years it went from sharing one bottle to sharing two-plus. Then it moved to having a drink as soon as I got home from work about 4pm.""

Need help or support?

Need help or support?

Her marriage eventually broke down, and Alice sought more comfort from the bottle.

Alcohol was no longer a treat in the home, but became part of her daily routine, regularly drinking alone. She didn't see as dangerous at the time.

""We hear horror stories of binge drinking but not about the middle class consumption of wine or a gin and tonic in the evening.

""When I grew up men went out to the pub and drank, women less so because alcohol was not generally available in the home except for special occasions. Things have equalised.""

Alice was signed off work with depression whilst dealing with her divorce, and after a day of drinking would often be inebriated by the time her daughter came home from school.

Her daughter often had to do the household chores she was unable to complete. ""She made tea on a number of occasions,"" recalls Alice.

""I had taken an 'overdose' on a couple of occasions - never serious attempts just feeling drunk and wretched. My daughter was about 12 at the time and she was becoming increasingly fearful about how much I was drinking.""

This, combined with GP blood tests, made her realise how much damage she was doing to herself and those around her.

Alice initially tried to seek help at AA meetings, but struggled with their 'male dominated' environment and could never find childcare for her daughter.

""There needs to be women only groups and support groups to help with childcare so they can attend appointments and meetings.""

""I think that women, especially single women, have more of an issue because they fear social service involvement and losing their children"".

After finding AA unsuccessful, she was referred to a support worker from the charity Change, Grow, Live who helped her with recovery on an individual basis near her home in Birmingham. They helped Alice set goals to help her see beyond drinking.

""One of the goals I set in early recovery was to join a choir, which I am still enjoying. I have now had a whole raft of excellent experiences.""

Knowing the risks

Defeating alcoholism also made Alice find some compromises in her life, which involved stepping back from career aspirations to focus on her family.

""I don't need to overdo it by working full-time. I spend more, and less stressful, time with the kids.""

The theme of Alcohol Awareness Week 2016, which ends on 20 November, is ""knowing the risks"" - getting people thinking about why they drink, and ""how it affects us as individuals, families, communities and society as a whole.""

Sian Warmer, head of services at CGL, the charity that helped Alice, says they help people identify why they are turning to drink.

""The reasons people use substances, whether they are drugs or alcohol, are endless and often very unique to the individual.

Gazza rehab: Paul Gascoigne reveals US clinic drama,Football star Paul Gascoigne reveals he thought he was going to die during his most recent spell in rehab in the US.,[],None,"Image caption Concerns for Gascoigne's wellbeing were raised again earlier this year

Football star Paul Gascoigne has revealed he thought he was going to die during his most recent spell in rehab.

The former England midfielder has flown back to the UK after more than a month at a clinic in Phoenix, Arizona, that specialises in treating alcoholism.

The 45-year-old told the Sun newspaper that he heard three doctors conclude he was going to pass away, before he slipped into a three-day coma.

His life was saved, but Gascoigne said: ""I thought I was on my way out.""

Fresh fears for the health of Gascoigne, who has battled against alcoholism for several years, emerged at a public appearance in Northampton in January.

'Total wreck'

Within days, he had been flown to the private clinic in the US and Gascoigne - nicknamed Gazza - said he begged its doctors at the clinic to save his life as he went through the detox process.

""Three doctors didn't think I would make it,"" he said.

""It has got to inspire me to never let this happen again. I've come through that - death. I was dead.""

He added: ""I thought I was on my way out. I looked like a corpse. I was a total wreck.""

Gascoigne, whose football clubs included Newcastle United, Tottenham, Lazio, Rangers and Everton, has had a long-term battle against alcohol addiction.

He said his latest problems started in Dubai last summer when he started drinking alcohol again after 17 months ""dry"". The ex-footballer said he followed that by staying off alcohol for the following six months, but his own despair at his lapse meant that he failed to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and isolated himself, barely eating. ""I was living like a dry drunk,"" he said.

Eventually, he succumbed and started drinking heavily again, a situation which came to public attention at the Northampton charity event when he broke down sobbing on stage.

On his admission to the US treatment centre, Gascoigne's management company said he was alcoholic with ""complex issues"" which were being dealt with by professionals.

It has since emerged that the public appearance could still raise thousands of pounds for charity.

Gascoigne said he had no recollection of being there.

'Another chance'

Gascoigne's drinking problems started during his playing days - he was admitted to the Priory Hospital, near Southampton, in 1998, shortly after his divorce from wife Sheryl.

Three years later, while playing at Everton, Gascoigne admitted himself to an alcohol rehabilitation clinic in Arizona on the insistence of his then manager Walter Smith.

In 2008, four years after retiring, he was arrested in Newcastle and detained under the Mental Health Act.

He was later sectioned following reports that he was acting strangely in Hemel Hempstead.

More recently he has been treated at The Priory again and at the Providence Projects treatment centre in Bournemouth.

Gascoigne told the Sun that the way forward for him now was to start attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings again.

""Meetings are really important. I was too weak, I stopped going to them. I have to start going.

""I should be dead. The doctors said I would not make it. But I'm here, I have another chance - and I'm going to take it.""","['alcohol', 'drama', 'problems', 'started', 'doctors', 'thought', 'public', 'gascoigne', 'way', 'rehab', 'going', 'paul', 'gazza', 'clinic', 'reveals']","Image caption Concerns for Gascoigne's wellbeing were raised again earlier this yearFootball star Paul Gascoigne has revealed he thought he was going to die during his most recent spell in rehab.

Church rebuilds 1960s singer's life,A 1960s singer songwriter tells an audience in Redruth how his faith helped him to rebuild his life.,[],None,"Image caption John Gaughan worked with many big names in the 1960s but hid his alcoholism for many years

From his early teens John Gaughan decided that he wanted to be a singer/songwriter and aim for the very top in the world of popular music.

By the time he was 19 years old he had achieved that goal.

Mr Gaughan was rubbing shoulders with the most successful writers and publishers of the day.

He was also singing with the top stars of the 1960s, as part of the band Herman's Hermits.

Mr Gaughan said: ""I was working with Billy J Kramer and Gerry Marsden and in America with Peter Noone and the Bee Gees.""

But there was one problem, as he will tell an audience at Redruth's Penventon Park Hotel on Friday 28th October.

""My life had really changed, but the only thing that remained constant was that I was an alcoholic. I had the money, and most of the time the alcohol was free.""

Mr Gaughan said he felt a huge ""emptiness inside that was increasingly being satisfied by alcohol"".

Image caption John Gaughan worked with bands, including the Bee Gees

""On the surface it looked absolutely fantastic. Behind the scenes I had to have a quarter bottle of vodka. I was walking a fine line between not having too much alcohol in my body and having just enough to stop me from shaking on stage.""

Eventually his dependence on alcohol took over and within a few years he was a broken man, ""in body, soul and spirit"".

Mr Gaughan said: ""I thought I could control it. I would give up drinking for a day, apart from the shakes. I went to my doctor and he said I would just have to give up drinking. I tried clinics, I tried hospitals. But nothing seemed to help. The desire was still there.

""Finally I couldn't cope. My marriage failed and my father died. That just left me devastated.""

Mr Gaughan eventually reached a point of total desperation and tried to end it all by throwing himself from the top window of a three storey building.

Life changing moment

He said: ""I thought I had no hope and no future. So I tried to take my own life. But I landed on my feet. I broke all the bones in my feet. Bones in my back were crushed. Yet my spinal chord remained intact.""

During the following months many people called to see him.

Mr Gaughan said: ""I was sat their drinking one night, watching the television, thinking I'm just going to lose everything again. But words came back to me about the time my Grandma told me about God. So I went to church that night. Nobody spoke to me, and I came away disappointed and went back home and sat there drinking.

""That night a man came to see me and said you don't need to be like that, there is a way out. As he was walking passed my flat he said he felt the need to come and knock on my door and tell me about Jesus. He invited me to his church. I went, and that night my life started to change.""

For the past two decades John said he had been given songs by the Lord and his heart's desire was ""to continue to touch people's lives through testimony and song"".

He said his broken bones healed and he has had ""total deliverance from his acute alcoholism"".

The unspoken alcohol problem among UK Punjabis,Alcohol consumption is glamorised across different aspects of Punjabi culture and shame stops many seeking the help that they need.,"['Anusha Kumar', 'Aidan Castelli', 'Chayya Syal', 'Bbc Digital Pilots']",None,"Image copyright Vik Kainth

For many British Punjabis, alcohol abuse is an open secret. Alcohol consumption is glamorised across different aspects of Punjabi culture and shame stops many seeking the help that they need.

Harjinder read her daughter Jaspreet one last bedtime story, then kissed her goodnight. She was exhausted after a long day, and drifted off next to her daughter. Her toddler son was already asleep in the next room.

The next thing she remembers is her husband yelling. He was drunk and furious that when he returned from the pub she wasn't in their marital bed. In a rage, he flipped the child's bed throwing his wife and daughter to the floor. Harjinder hit the radiator hard with Jaspreet landing on top of her.

Incidents like this were a regular feature of Jaspreet and her brother Hardeep's childhood. ""It was heartbreaking,"" Jaspreet says.

So when Harjinder found Hardeep, now aged 16, drinking whisky in his room after an argument with his alcoholic dad, she was terrified that he was following in his father's footsteps.

There are around 430,000 Sikhs in the UK, making up a significant proportion of the British Punjabi population. Harjinder herself is Sikh and amongst her community her experience isn't unique.

A new survey, commissioned by the BBC to investigate attitudes to alcohol among British Sikhs, found that - although drinking alcohol is forbidden in Sikhism - 27% of British Sikhs report having someone in their family with an alcohol problem. It's a problem which is rarely talked about openly in the community.

More than 1,000 British Sikhs responded to the survey - find out more using this interactive tool:

Harjinder moved in with her husband's family after their arranged marriage - both common practices within Punjabi and wider South Asian communities. She was shocked to find out how much her newly acquired family's social life centred around the men's excessive drinking.

The family, along with young children, would go to a friend's house and would stay there until two or three o'clock in the morning waiting for the men, and she started to feel increasingly isolated.

Rav Sekhon, a British Punjabi psychotherapist who works with ethnic minority communities, says: ""There is really strong pride and honour for the family name. They don't want anyone to perceive them as having something wrong with them or any form of weakness.""

Sanjay Bhandari is from a Hindu Punjabi family, a partner at a multinational city firm in London and a recovering alcoholic. After his father died when he was 15, he says he started drinking and never really stopped.

By his mid 30s, he realised that he hadn't been a single day without a drink for over seven years, and he'd been dependent on alcohol for much longer. He says his Punjabi background played a big part in discouraging him from admitting he had a problem.

Sanjay, who has been sober for 16 years, says he didn't feel that he could admit he had a weakness, nor that he was feeling lonely and self-medicating with alcohol. He didn't look to the Punjabi community for help, but eventually found Alcoholics Anonymous.

""It would never have occurred to me to go to the community for help with drinking. It was almost the last place I would have gone.""

When the first immigrants, who were mostly men, came to the UK from Punjab in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, many found themselves struggling to assimilate being in a new country, often working long hours to send money home to their families.

The stresses of moving to a new culture, the associated language barriers and the racism they faced meant many of these men turned to alcohol to cope. This reliance on alcohol has had generational repercussions.

Jennifer Shergill, an alcohol practitioner from the West Midlands, works with Sikh men and women to manage and overcome addiction. She points to the combination of British binge drinking and the culture of drinking in Punjab, which together create a perfect storm for some of the people accessing support services.

For Harjinder, her husband's heavy drinking had worsening consequences. Although he was becoming increasingly violent towards her, she was still reluctant to seek help.

She says his behaviour was normalised by his family, leaving her feeling almost brainwashed by them into hopelessly accepting the situation. It wasn't until she went to her GP with injuries from the abuse that she realised that what she was experiencing wasn't normal.

Eventually Harjinder called the police and she and her children moved out of the family home to stay with her parents. Even then her husband didn't acknowledge the impact that his drinking was having.

""I think [my husband] knew deep down that what he was doing was wrong but it was almost as if his male pride couldn't admit it.""

Image copyright Vik Kainth

Jennifer Shergill thinks one of the barriers for people seeking help is the fear of someone finding out. ""There is stigma associated with chronic alcohol misuse and they don't want their reputation to be tainted... if there is a dependent drinker in the family what might people think of our family?""

The Shanti Project, where Jennifer works, is just one scheme working to tackle this stigma and to provide culturally appropriate services for the Punjabi community in Birmingham.

Others include a volunteer-led Sikh Helpline, the Derby Recovery Network, BAC-IN, and First Step Foundation, which are all doing their part to help tackle alcoholism in a culturally sensitive way.

The Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute Harjinder's husband due to a lack of evidence and, six weeks later, Harjinder and her children returned to the home she shared with her husband.

Her husband's family had visited her to assure her he had stopped drinking and things would be different - so feeling the pressure from both his family and her own, she and her children returned home.

But Harjinder struggled with depression. Her husband hadn't stopped drinking. It was at this point that - prompted by a community psychiatric nurse - she started talking to a counsellor. ""I felt quite desperate at times,"" she says, ""but the counselling really helped, I felt that I could carry on.""

Harjinder is still living with her husband after more than 20 years of marriage, but their lives are very separate now. Her daughter, now in her 20s, constantly urges her to leave him.

""I've thought about it a lot. A part of me thinks, why bother at this age? But then another part of me thinks: well, if I've got another 20 years of this, that's not good. I think it could happen.""

Harjinder and her family members' names have been changed.

A group which offers science-based support for people with alcohol, drug and gambling addictions plans to expand its service in Devon.

Self Management and Recovery Training (SMART) uses motivational, behavioural and cognitive methods.

The NHS Devon Drug and Alcohol Action Team is spending £4,000 to help it form more groups in the county.

SMART Recovery currently has seven groups and hopes to open a further 10 in the next two years.

The organisation said it gives people alternatives to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA).

'Addictive behaviour'

SMART Recovery uses a four-step plan which helps participants decide whether they have a problem, builds up their motivation to change and offers a set of techniques to support recovery, a spokesperson said.

Richard Phillips, director of SMART Recovery, said: ""We have evidence that all the individual techniques work.

""Clearly AA and NA work very well for some people, for other people SMART Recovery might work better.

""Our approach is very much to place the responsibility of change within the individual, they've got the ability to choose to change their addictive behaviour.""

Kristian Tomblin, from the Devon Drug and Alcohol Action Team, said it was important to have a range of services in place to accommodate different needs.

Mr Phillips said there was 650 groups worldwide with 80 in the UK.

Relapse can be part of recovery. That's when they really learn to move on. I've worked with people who have relapsed 20 or 30 times and have got there in the end Julie Rogers, Substance misuse manager

Dependency

NHS figures suggest nine in every 100 men and four in every 100 women show signs of alcohol dependence.

Drinking alcohol becomes a focus in daily life, meaning the person no longer has control over their drinking and depends on it to get through the day.

You don't necessarily have to be rolling around drunk to have a dependency on alcohol - people may be able to hold down a career and drink in a way that is damaging.

Dependency mean you are physically and psychologically tied to booze - you feel compelled to drink and this takes its toll on your physical and emotional health.

Julie Rogers has been working in the addiction field for 12 years, helping people who are hooked on alcohol.

Ms Rogers, who works with the charity Foundation 66, says problem drinking is a complex and incredibly difficult behaviour to break. No two people are the same and there is no single approach that is guaranteed to work.

""Alcohol addiction does not have any boundaries. It affects all types of people alike. It doesn't matter if you are wealthy or poor.

Warning signs of alcohol dependence Worrying about where your next drink is coming from and planning social, family and work events around alcohol

Finding you have a compulsive need to drink and finding it hard to stop once you start

Waking up and drinking - or feeling the need to have a drink in the morning

Suffering from withdrawal symptoms, such as sweating, shaking and nausea, which stop once you drink alcohol

""And there are so many different reasons why people drink. But the thing they do have in common is that, for them, alcohol has become more than just a drink.

""It becomes something that you need to do to cope and get through. That's when it becomes a problem.""

For some, the trigger is stress or anxiety - a demanding job or a traumatic divorce, for example.

She said for others it is a learned behaviour - something they have been exposed to during their childhood and have grown up to follow the same path.

Genetics can also make some people susceptible, experts suspect.

Breaking the cycle

Regardless of the cause, the first step to tackling addiction is the same.

Ms Rogers said: ""Recognising you have a problem and then seeking help is the first step.

""It sounds simple but, in reality it's not. It can be hard to admit you have a problem and actually do something about it.""

The former Newcastle, Tottenham and Lazio player has tried hard to fight his addiction, spending repeated spells in rehab over the last decade.

Alcohol harms Short term health risks include alcohol poisoning and accidents and injuries

Long term health consequences include an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, liver disease (which can cause jaundice), pancreatitis and certain cancers

Drinking too much can also affect your relationships and your ability to hold down a job

It can lead to anxiety, depression and suicidal feelings

Gazza's drinking problems started during his playing days.

In 1998, shortly after his divorce from wife Sheryl, he was admitted to the The Priory Hospital in Marchwood, near Southampton, to receive treatment for stress and drink problems.

In 2001, whilst playing at Everton, Gascoigne admitted himself to an alcohol rehabilitation clinic in Arizona on the insistence of his then manager Walter Smith.

Four years after retiring, in 2008, he was arrested in Newcastle and detained under the Mental Health Act and was later sectioned following reports that he was acting strangely in Hemel Hempstead.

More recently he has been treated at The Priory again and the Providence Projects treatment centre in Bournemouth.

Ms Rogers says relapses are incredibly common, and they shouldn't be seen as a failure.

""It's important that we do not judge relapse because that just compounds the shame and guilt people feel about it.

Dennis' story I took my first drink in my early teens. There were consequences from my drinking from the beginning, very small at first: arguing with friends, turning up late for social appointments, losing keys, urinating in alleyways, and general behaviours I would not engage in when I wasn't drinking. As I reached my 20s I had destroyed a marriage by now, and I was well on that alcoholic slippery downhill slope. I was starting to lose jobs as I could not be trusted to turn up for work. Into my 30s, my drinking very subtly but progressively got worse; the dry spells between my binges got shorter and shorter. I had started too waken up in strange places and also in A&E hospitals and couldn't remember how I got there. The last 10 years of my drinking, I had tried many avenues of escape in order to stop drinking completely and failed every single time. At 40 years old I was truly beaten by alcohol. I had heard and of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and had visited AA meetings in the past but nothing else, I would visit and then leave and eventually always drink again. I did not know what it was to be an alcoholic, and I had not fully admitted to myself that I was an alcoholic. Now, through AA's 12-step recovery programme, I have a productive, contented life with complete abstinence from alcohol.

""Relapse can be part of recovery. That's when they really learn to move on. I've worked with people who have relapsed 20 or 30 times and have got there in the end.

""Even if it is your thousandth relapse, it can still be the last. It's important not to give up.""

She said in order to break the cycle some people need to hit a critical point where it's ""stop drinking or die"".

Help on hand

But for others, abstinence is never an option.

Instead, they might work towards curbing their intake, even if it means they are still drinking far too much for good health.

""Some people reduce the harm rather than stop drinking.

""Some relapse every few months but still lead a fulfilling life. Even if you get a month of sobriety at least it's a month.""

She said there is plenty of help available to anyone struggling to keep their drinking under control.

Activities offer hope to recovering addicts,People recovering from drug and alcohol addiction in Gwynedd and Anglesey have been boosted by a new charity which offers support day and night.,[],None,"Image caption More than 70 people have contacted AGRO at Holyhead and Bangor since last September

People recovering from drug and alcohol addiction in Gwynedd and Anglesey have been boosted by a new charity which offers support day and night.

The Anglesey and Gwynedd Recovery Organisation (AGRO) uses activities like gardening and group sessions to support people in their bid to give up drink and drugs.

More than 70 people have already approached AGRO's Holyhead and Bangor groups for help since it was set up last September, just through word of mouth recommendation.

Its founders are now starting to publicise their work and have secured funding from the Safer Anglesey and Gwynedd partnerships to set up groups in Amlwch, Llangefni and Caernarfon.

Huw Harries, who is a support worker for the dug and alcohol rehabilitation organisation CAIS by day, co-founded the charity in his spare time using his own funds.

Image caption AGRO hope to soon launch groups in Amlwch, Llangefni and Caernarfon

As a former alcoholic himself, Huw feels able to reach out to those who are also fighting to get sober.

He said: ""I haven't had a drink in 15 years. I used to be a nightclub manager and I suppose I'm on the other side of the fence now.

""I gave up because my wife gave me an ultimatum, saying she'd go back to Scotland if I didn't. I'm so glad I did because she died of cancer two years later and I was able to nurse her with a clear head.""

But after working for CAIS for eight years, Huw realised that those in need had nowhere to turn to in the evenings or weekends.

Now AGRO offer 24-hour phone support to help an addict avoid having another drink or talk them through a period of anxiety.

But AGRO's other aim is to help people to recover through getting involved in new activities.

They have already turned a piece of Holyhead waste ground into a productive vegetable garden and have future plans to acquire more allotments and open a shop to sell their produce. They will plough any profit back into the community.

They also organise walks, kayaking sessions and fishing at weekends to help people get active and have something else to think about.

""It gives people something else to do when they come out of rehab after three or six months,"" explained Huw.

""And people really want to do it. It isn't often you have alcohol and drug addicts working on something together.""

He was spurred on to start the groups on Anglesey after figures suggested more people from the island were admitted into Bangor's Ysbyty Gwynedd with alcohol-related problems than from anywhere in Gwynedd.

But from small beginnings, he see big demand for AGRO's work.

""We have all sorts of members,"" said Huw. ""Students, people who own their own businesses, housewives, unemployed people.

""The days of people drinking all day haven't completely gone, but mostly now people binge-drink when they get stressed, or have a glass or two, or a bottle every night.

""And the price of alcohol doesn't matter. If you want a drink you'll get it, even if there are no buses and you have to walk a long way.

""It's easier to get some alcohol than call a doctor for help at night.""

Although Huw is happy to help those who want to recover, he thinks that educating those who are yet to find themselves in trouble is ultimately the way forward.

""We want to go into schools or go to the WI to educate people about the side-effects of alcohol,"" he said.

""If you catch people early enough, then you'll avoid spending money on A&E or on unemployment, divorce or sorting out the effect on the kids.""

""I've seen the suffering it can cause and want to help people early on.""

Schools in North Yorkshire are piloting a theatre scheme which aims to educate teenagers about the dangers of alcohol.

Harrogate has one of the highest levels of alcohol-related hospital admissions for under 18s in Yorkshire, according to the Centre for Public Health.

The play, by Bryan Bounds, is about the life of Bill Wilson the found of Alcoholics Anonymous.

Mr Bounds said the drama allowed students to learn about alcoholism and its destructive effects.

'Growing concern'

My Name is Bill, which is performed by Mr Bounds, the founder of the Leeds-based Amerrycan Theatre, was shown to critical praise at the Edinburgh Fringe and has been adapted for use in education.

Mr Bounds, himself a recovering alcoholic, said: ""I've watched with growing concern about how alcohol has become such a big issue for young people.

""A lot of alcohol education is quite patronising and condescending but students are very switched on, very sophisticated.""

The Centre for Public Health said Harrogate was second only to Wakefield in Yorkshire for alcohol-related hospital admissions for under 18s.

The drama is being shown to Year 12 students at Ashville College and St Aiden's School.

Marion Farrar, business liaison officer at St Aiden's School, said: ""I think young people see alcohol as a norm these days which is a worrying trend.

AA: America's Gift to the World,,[],2015-04-01 13:36:32+00:00,"AL Kennedy's new Radio 4 documentary - America's Gift to the World - tells the story of Alcoholics Anonymous and its methods, and asks whether AA is still the best 'cure' for addicts given new science and treatments. This is the background to the story, and how the making of the programme impacted on its presenter.

The initials AA are peripherally familiar to many, as is perhaps the name Alcoholics Anonymous. Nevertheless, I think a lot of people don’t know much about AA or the story of its creation – when Bill Wilson, an alcoholic wall street trader with a big idea about staying sober, met an alcoholic doctor, Bob Smith. They talked and understood each other, helped each other get sober and worked out a way they could pass that on. I’ve seen friends ruin their own lives and those of all around them through dysfunctional drinking: the idea of two people finding a way to unravel that nightmare is truly beautiful and fascinating.

AA’s desire to preserve its members' privacy and to make no grand statements on issues, meant we had to be sensitive about interviews. It’s also probably one reason why AA isn’t well-known outside its membership. AA’s also an intentionally disorganised organisation. I loved looking at a huge association which seems to do exactly what it intends and yet which is specifically engineered to concentrate power and responsibility downwards and to avoid creating authority figures, funding drives, advertising drives and so forth. It seems to reverse modern thinking about success, but has millions of members, has lasted 80 years and still rolls on.

With so many products and experiences now designed to exert an addictive or pseudo-addictive influence, I suppose AA pushes against some powerful trends in society. As was pointed out during my research, alcohol use is central to many of our social occasions, celebrations, even some religious ceremonies. Anyone trying to stay away from drink isn’t going to have it easy. AA isn’t for everyone, but it seems to work very well for those who do use it.

What I was struck by most of all was the generosity, honesty and compassion of all our contributors. We have hours of wonderful stories and insights that we just couldn’t fit into the programme. The professionals we spoke to were genuinely passionate about trying to understand alcoholism and help alcoholics to recover. AA members were searingly frank about themselves – and very funny - and really had a grip on who they were and how they could meet the world. We also interviewed Al-Anon and Alateen members – those affected by the drinking of others. Their experiences and bravery were startling, humbling. It was really a privilege to meet them all.

Teacher Steven Watt struck off for drunken behaviour at music camp,A primary teacher is struck off after getting drunk at a music camp and climbing into the bed of a male pupil.,[],None,"A primary teacher has been struck off after getting drunk at a music camp and climbing into the bed of a male pupil.

Steven Watt, 41, was employed by Angus Council at the time of the incident in October 2011.

At a General Teaching Council hearing, he admitted charges including being intoxicated while caring for children.

A panel determined Watt's behaviour fell ""significantly short of the standards expected of a registered teacher"" and deemed him unfit to teach.

The complaint to the General Teaching Council for Scotland related to incidents during a music band camp on the evening of 28 October and the next morning.

Alcohol problem

The panel heard Watt engaged in conversation and made remarks to a number of children in his care which were ""inappropriate and offensive"".

He suggested to a number of male pupils in a dormitory that he was conducting a survey. He then asked one pupil if he was ""camp"" and told him ""it was okay to be gay these days"".

The teacher then stroked the same pupil's arm and got into his bed.

A further charge said he later drove a vehicle while ""intoxicated by alcohol or some other substance"".

Parts of the hearing were held in private in order to protect the identity of the children involved.

Watt told the panel he had suffered from an alcohol problem for much of his life but following the incident at the music camp he was now attending Alcoholics Anonymous.

He said he not had an alcoholic drink for more than a year.

Watt said he missed teaching and that he would like to return to the profession.

The teaching council told Watt a period of two years would have to pass before he could apply to re-register with the council.

The panel also suggested his name be referred to Scottish ministers under the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act 2007.","['music', 'council', 'teaching', 'teacher', 'struck', 'behaviour', 'camp', 'watt', 'panel', 'told', 'suggested', 'steven', 'drunken', 'scotland']","A primary teacher has been struck off after getting drunk at a music camp and climbing into the bed of a male pupil.

A recovering alcoholic has been jailed for four months for stealing £11,000 from a faulty Ulster Bank cash machine.

A judge told Peter Anthony Young, 58, of Hunter's Way, Ardglass, that he had ""deliberately taken advantage'' of the major glitch in the bank's system almost four years ago.

It meant customers could withdraw funds from ATM machines without affecting their balance.

Following a check, the bank discovered the money had been withdrawn by Young.

A prosecution lawyer told Downpatrick Crown Court that on 22 June 2012, Ulster Bank had ""experienced a computer malfunction in its system''.

""Following a check, Ulster Bank discovered that Young, who was one of its customers, had £11,000 withdrawn from his account on that day,'' said Ms Ivers.

The judge was told there had been 22 separate withdrawals of £500 on the day in question.

The prosecution lawyer said the bank made repeated attempts to contact Young without success before eventually reporting the incident to police as ""fraudulent''.

The PSNI started an investigation and Young voluntarily attended a police station and admitted making the withdrawals, telling police he had ""spent the money on drink''.

The prosecution lawyer said the accused, who was a customer of the Ulster Bank, had ""made no effort to pay back the funds'' and the outstanding balance he owed now stood at £10,908.40.

A defence lawyer described it as an ""unusual case'' and said that when Young was interviewed by police in September 2014 he made ""frank admissions'' to his crimes.

""Reading between the lines from the court papers, it appears Mr Young was in the company of other people drinking with them that day and when he was taking money out it became apparent to him and the others that there was a fault with this machine,"" he told the court.

""This was always going to come home to him.

'Downward spiral'

""He is not in the least blaming others.''

The defence lawyer said that Young's life had ""taken a downward spiral'' following the death of his mother in 1991 and said that by the age of 34 he was an alcoholic, homeless and ""living on the streets of Belfast''.

The lawyer added that the father-of-five was now a recovering alcoholic, who was attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, was part of a church group and was also attending a rehabilitation programme.

The defence lawyer said Young could be made the subject of a community order which ""would leave something hanging over his head that would remind him not to stray from the straight and narrow again''.

""I would urge the court to give him a chance to continue to improve himself,'' the lawyer added.

The judge said Young had gone to the machine on one occasion to withdraw £500 on the day in question.

""He chose to return to this machine a further 21 times to withdraw the money when he knew he did not have the funds in his account,"" he said.

""He knew full well what he was doing and he deliberately took advantage of the defective ATM.""

The judge said Young, who is living on social security benefits, had not repaid any money he had stolen from the Ulster Bank.

""I don't believe I could deal with this case by way of a suspended sentence. The least sentence I can impose is one of four months in custody.''","['day', 'money', 'faulty', 'bank', 'prosecution', 'ulster', 'lawyer', 'judge', 'court', 'told', 'young', 'man', 'stealing', '11000', 'jailed', 'atm']","Image copyright PA Image caption A prosecution lawyer told Downpatrick Crown Court that on June 22, 2012, Ulster Bank had 'experienced a computer malfunction in its system'A recovering alcoholic has been jailed for four months for stealing £11,000 from a faulty Ulster Bank cash machine.

Serial drink-driver avoids jail 'for being a woman',A judge tells Victoria Parry she would have been sent straight to prison if she were a man.,[],None,"Image copyright Paul Beard Image caption If Victoria Parry had been a man ""it would have been straight down the stairs"" to prison, a judge said

A judge gave a serial drink-driver a chance to avoid jail because she is a woman.

Victoria Parry, 30, hit three other cars after downing a bottle of wine.

Judge Sarah Buckingham said Parry, an alcoholic who had escaped an abusive relationship, would have gone ""straight down the stairs"" to jail if she were a man.

Although Parry ""deserved"" a prison term, the judge gave her three months to address her issues.

The comments are being investigated by a judicial watchdog.

Prosecutor Tim Sapwell said Parry caught a van's rear bumper, a Vauxhall Insignia's wing mirror, then the side of a BMW ""very heavily"" in the crash.

'Shocking case'

He told Warwick Crown Court it caused her Fiat to spin off the A46 near Stratford-upon-Avon into a wooded area where it caught fire.

An off-duty police officer pulled her from the car, and Parry, who was banned from the road at the time, told him she had drunk a bottle of wine and ""shouldn't be driving"", Mr Sapwell said.

She was arrested, and registered a reading of almost three times the legal limit at a police station.

Lucy Tapper, defending, said Parry had a ""considerable drink problem"" after a 15-year abusive relationship, but had begun to tackle her alcohol intake.

The judge said: ""If Miss Parry was a man, there is no question it would have been straight down the stairs, because this is a shocking case of dangerous driving against a background of two previous convictions for excess alcohol.""

But, she said, the offence had been committed in May 2018, and Parry, who had admitted dangerous driving, had not been in trouble since.

""She has clearly got an alcohol problem. She is, whether she admits it or not, an alcoholic,"" the judge said.

Deferring sentencing for three months, judge Buckingham told Parry she ""richly deserved"" an immediate custodial term of 18 months.

""I want to see whether you can really address the issues rather than paying lip service,"" she said.

She ordered Parry to abstain from alcohol, attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and pay for private counselling.

If Parry complied, she said, the custody would not be made immediate.

""If you don't comply, I will conclude that you are not worthy of the chance,"" the judge added.

The Judicial Conduct Investigations Office confirmed it received a complaint about the remarks attributed to the judge.

Can a parent save their child from addiction?,The death of Amy Winehouse has once again highlighted the danger of drink and drug addiction. The struggles of Mitch and Janis Winehouse to cure their daughter of her addiction are shared by thousands of couples up and down the country.,"['Chris Summers', 'Bbc News']",None,"Image caption In the film Trainspotting, Renton (Ewan McGregor) is put through ""cold turkey"" by his parents

The death of Amy Winehouse has once again highlighted the danger of drink and drug addiction. Mitch and Janis Winehouse's battles to cure their daughter of her addiction are shared by thousands of parents up and down the country.

Many parents reading of the death at the weekend of singer Amy Winehouse will have thought to themselves: ""What would I do if my son or daughter was an addict?""

Some people, like Tom Methven, know only too well what they would do and whether it would work.

His son, Jason, 29, is an alcoholic.

Mr Methven, from Surrey, said: ""When I heard about Amy Winehouse I thought, 'It's finally got her'.

'Slave to the addiction'

""Drugs and alcohol damage a receptor in the brain. You become a slave. Why else would she have kept taking it? She was a very similar age to my son.""

Hannah Meredith was 17 when she died of a heroin overdose in October 2009.

Image caption Teenager Hannah Meredith wrote a ""letter to heroin"" a month before her death in 2009

A month before she died, she wrote a ""letter to heroin"". Her aunt, Lisa Moore, read out excerpts from the letter on BBC Radio Five Live last year.

Ms Moore told the BBC: ""It takes years to recover but it only takes seconds to relapse.""

She said: ""We heard about Amy Winehouse's death on Saturday and it brought back feelings of what happened to Hannah. It was two years ago, but it's still raw.""

Ms Moore said: ""I've read stuff on Facebook about Amy like 'one less junkie', and it is so ignorant and insensitive. Families feel helpless, they feel like failures, they think, 'How can we fix it when that person is choosing to do it'?""

""What people don't realise is that no matter how badly someone is on drugs nothing ever prepares you for the knock on the door or the phone call, nothing prepares you for their death.""

She said Hannah had been given an ecstasy tablet on her 14th birthday, ""liked the feeling"" and by the age of 15 was on heroin.

Two years later she was ""clean"" but then had her fatal relapse.

""She had been in recovery for four months and was sure she was in control of heroin. She might have thought she would try it one more time,"" said Ms Moore.

Both Ms Moore and Mr Methven said there was a lot of ignorance about substance abuse.

Tough love

They said many people thought they could just lock their son or daughter in a room and make them go ""cold turkey"" - completely denying them drink or drugs - to exorcise their demons.

The cold turkey scene has cropped up in films like Trainspotting and soap operas like EastEnders, where a parent uses so-called ""tough love"".

But Mr Methven says the reality is that it very rarely works.

He has tried almost everything to rescue his son from his alcoholism:

Rehab - two sessions in a £500-a-day private clinic.

Medication - Antabuse, or disulfiram, a tablet which makes the taker sick if he or she drinks alcohol.

Sectioning - a compulsory week in a mental health unit.

Psychiatry - several sessions with a top specialist.

At his worst point Jason, who weighs 19 stone (120kg), was drinking huge quantities of vodka and would become violent and aggressive.

""One time he smashed a piece of glass at his girlfriend's house and cut an artery. I had to follow the trail of blood to find him. They broke up about a month later. She couldn't cope with it,"" said Mr Methven.

He said: ""Another time he was self-harming. He burned himself with an iron and was then banging his head against a table.

""He tried to cut his wrists once with a knife. The police were called and he was taken to hospital.

""He was so drunk he was fighting with the security guards and he got one of them, a big guy, on the floor. Eventually he was given a very strong tranquilliser.""

Mr Methven said his son, who is an only child, had a normal childhood and was very intelligent.

He went to university and got a first with honours before embarking on a PhD.

Out of control

But his drinking, which had started as a teenager, got out of control and he never completed it.

Jason is now unemployed and gets £20 a week in Disability Living Allowance.

""That is supposed to be given to his mum for laundry and shopping but it is in many respects money for alcohol,"" said his father.

Mr Methven said: ""He was about 24 when we realised he had a real problem. We went to the doctor and got a referral.

""We wanted to get him into rehab but it took so long on the NHS that we panicked and went private.""

Jason has been into rehab twice.

There is no alcohol in the house now. I used to have some good quality wine. It was very well hid. I was going to give it to a friend as a present but it was gone. He had drunk it John Methven, Father of an alcoholic

On one occasion Mr Methven spent £18,000 and he said: ""Before the cheque was even dry he was back on the drink.""

He said: ""There is no alcohol in the house now. I used to have some good-quality wine. It was very well hid. I was going to give it to a friend as a present but it was gone. He had drunk it.""

Mr Methven said his son had stolen money from him and his wife and had also taken DVDs and other property and sold it at cash converter shops to provide drinking money.

'Secretive' drinking

""It's always secretive drinking. He doesn't go to the pub. He just drinks in his room. He hid it in rucksacks or under the hedge in the garden,"" he said.

Jason has now joined Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and has a sponsor, but he is still drinking.

""He is trying to take it down. Yesterday he had six cans (of beer) and today it's four. He is still drinking but it's far less,"" said Mr Methven.

But he said the crucial thing was that Jason has now said he wants to stop.

Image caption Nicholas Mills (pictured) hanged himself after a drug-fuelled argument but his twin brother survived and is now clean

""If they are going to get well they have got to go to AA or NA (Narcotics Anonymous). The individual is powerless, but collectively they can do it. It's a spiritual thing. AA is about giving it up altogether.

""Once you are an alcoholic or an addict one is too many and 100 is not enough.""

Asked how he feels about his son now, he said: ""It's not so much shame as disappointment about what he could have done with his life.""

While Mr Methven can understand the addiction, Elizabeth Burton-Phillips knows the heartbreak of what she calls the ""double whammy"" of addiction and death.

Her twin sons, Nicholas and Simon, both became heroin addicts.

Nicholas died in 2004 but Simon survived and has kicked the habit.

Mrs Burton-Phillips, from Buckinghamshire, has since set up a charity, DrugFam, and she told the BBC: ""We are trying to help families who are struggling to cope with the addiction of their loved ones, like Amy and my son.""

She said she met Amy's mother in 2008 and added: ""I have been in text contact with her since Amy passed and they are obviously going to be terribly badly affected.""

Mrs Burton-Phillips travelled to Llanelli on Monday to give her moral support to the Hannah Meredith Foundation, which launched a support group for the families of those in the Carmarthenshire area coping with substance abuse.

Anyone wanting to contact the foundation should do so through their Facebook page.

Lou Vincent: The most brutal form of apology,Cricketer Lou Vincent this week admitted he was a cheat. His apology came in stark style.,"['Justin Parkinson', 'Bbc News Magazine']",None,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lou Vincent

The cricketer Lou Vincent has admitted attempting to fix matches. His apology came in stark style.

He exhales loudly. Then he begins his statement: ""My name is Lou Vincent and I am a cheat.""

The former New Zealand cricketer, in 10 words, admits what he has done, how he has contravened and undermined his own sport by accepting money for match-fixing. Viewers are left in no doubt.

Vincent, at the age of 35, has been banned for life from playing, coaching or participating in any other way in organised cricket after breaching 18 anti-corruption rules in matches played in 2008 and 2011.

Even so, the nature of the opening of his video confession - in which he goes on to say he has ""shamed"" his sport, country and family - seems unusually stark.

The formula of the opening words is the same as that used by some members of Alcoholics Anonymous. Those attending at meetings are not compelled to say: ""My name is XXXX and I am an alcoholic."" But many choose to do so, citing its cathartic effect and the creation of a sense of community.

Vincent, who has suffered from depression, is unlikely to feel the same immediate mutual support from his fellow cricketers. But might he eventually gain respect for his statement, in which he also says he wants to face up to what he has done ""like a man and accept the consequences""?

""It's very healthy,"" says Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at Lancaster University. ""You don't get enough of people admitting when they've done something wrong, particularly in the workplace.""

Uruguayan footballer Luis Suarez has faced criticism over his initial refusal to apologise for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini in a World Cup match. He has since given a qualified apology - one that expressed sympathy for his victim but did not fully address Suarez's culpability and ongoing problem.

""What the cricketer has done is completely unlike the Suarez situation,"" says Cooper. ""If Suarez had come out straight away and said he'd done wrong under the stress of the situation he would have received much more sympathy. What's happened here in cricket will raise Vincent in people's estimation. The timing is absolutely key.""

Vincent recorded his statement after admitting to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) that he had committed match-fixing offences in Twenty20 games when he played for Lancashire and Sussex. It pre-empted the ECB's own announcement.

Sussex County Cricket Club has welcomed the punishment of Vincent, who has played in 23 Tests and 102 one-day internationals. ""The episode has been a very difficult time for our players, staff and indeed all supporters of Sussex Cricket,"" says chief executive Zac Toumazi. ""We are determined to do all we can to drive this issue away from our game and remain vigilant and committed in doing so.""

Cricket is keen to clean up its image after revelations going back more than a decade, when it was revealed the South African captain Hansie Cronje had fixed matches.

In his confession in 2000, Cronje opened by saying he had been a Christian all his life and had tried to ""walk the way the Lord wanted me to walk"".

The golfer Tiger Woods, in his scripted 2010 apology in front of the world's media for his marital infidelities, also adopted a more gradual introduction to the description of his wrongdoings than Vincent.

""Good morning. And thank you for joining me,"" he said. ""Many of you in the room are my friends. Many of you in this room know me. Many of you have cheered for me, or worked with me, or supported me, and now, every one of you has good reason to be critical of me.

""I want to say to each of you, simply, and directly, I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish behaviour I engaged in.""

Could Vincent's more direct statement lead to some form of public redemption, even if it does not, and cannot, involve any future involvement with cricket?

""What he has done is probably the best way,"" says speechwriter and presentation coach Max Atkinson. ""It reminds me of (Liberal Democrat leader) Paddy Ashdown in 1992 admitting he had had an affair. That worked. He came across as honest. It's best just to come out and say it.""

The difference is that Ashdown could argue his personal life did not interfere with his professional one. Like Cronje, Vincent cannot.

But Peter Davies, a consultant at Manchester PR firm RMS, thinks there is a chance of a return to some standing. ""Lou Vincent's statement comes across like it's personal,"" he says. ""That's good. Although he must have had advice, probably including from his lawyers, it doesn't sound like that. It's not over-scripted and he does it in his own voice.

""But Vincent has lots of work to do if he wants to change his image. He'll have to do something to show he's trying to make a difference and he's truly changed his ways.""

Shot barrister Mark Saunders' 20-year alcohol struggle,"Mark Saunders, the barrister shot dead by police marksmen, was a ""gutsy and polished"" courtroom opponent - but had his own two-decade struggle with alcohol.","['Nick Beake', 'Bbc London Home Affairs Producer']",None,"Image caption Mr Saunders ended two months of sobriety the day before he died

In the crucible of the courtroom, he was an impressive figure.

Described in one directory of lawyers as ""popular, gutsy and polished"", Oxford graduate Mark Saunders fought on behalf of celebrity clients in high-profile and often acrimonious divorce cases.

But for nearly 20 years, he was struggling to control his alcohol intake.

It was following one heavy afternoon binge in the spring of 2008 that 32-year-old Mr Saunders found himself with a bottle of wine in one hand and a shotgun in the other, firing from the window of his £2m flat in Chelsea.

Police said they feared for their safety and the public's. On Thursday an inquest jury agreed that they had lawfully killed Mr Saunders.

When Mr Saunders began drinking at the age of 13, it was not to escape the reality of a sad and deprived life. Rather, it was in the surroundings of his private school in Cheshire.

After gaining his law degree from Christ Church College, Oxford, and serving with the Territorial Army, he joined the respected QEB Chambers in central London.

But while his profession career soared, his descent into alcohol abuse accelerated.

'Out of control'

By 2005 - three years before his death - Mr Saunders was drinking to excess most nights.

He himself admitted he was ""out of control"".

Some weeks he would drink the equivalent of four bottles of spirits. That year, he received a police caution for being drunk and disorderly.

His wife of two years, Elizabeth, also a barrister, told the inquest her husband was a ""sensitive"" man with a ""huge energy and love for life"". They were, she said, ""very much in love"".

Image caption Mr Saunders' marriage to Elizabeth was strained by his drinking

But their marriage was considerably strained by his drinking.

""I know he contacted Alcoholics Anonymous and went there on three or four occasions,"" she told the inquest jury. ""But he felt it wasn't for him, and it didn't work out.

""What Mark wanted to do was control the drinking, to be able to be a social drinker. There were occasions, probably every three months or so, when it went wrong.""

Mr Saunders' best friend Alex Booth often saw what happened when it did go wrong.

""He completely lost touch with reality,"" he said in a statement.

Mr Booth explained how his friend had ended up in casualty on several occasions, and while drinking he would be ""in a fantasy world, he wouldn't respond or engage with you"".

That fantasy world was often induced by cocaine as well as alcohol.

Tests revealed Mr Saunders had used the drug regularly in the six months before his death - although not within the last 12 hours of his life. His wife knew nothing of his drug habit.

Mr Saunders did recognise he had a problem and sought help. To stabilise his mood swings, he was prescribed the antidepressant Prozac.

In 2006, a psychiatrist examined him and warned that if he did not ""abstain completely from all mind-altering substances"" he could find himself being killed in a fight.

'Bulging eyes'

The other fear, according to medical notes, was that Mr Saunders would commit suicide if a period of depression and an alcohol binge coincided.

In February 2008, he told his wife he was giving up drinking for good. He was sober for the next two months. On the evening of 5 May, he had one glass of wine.

The following day would be Mr Saunders' last.

It is unclear at what point in the afternoon he began drinking, but by the time a taxi driver dropped him off near his home at about 1600 BST, it was evident that he was drunk.

Image caption Mr Saunders was shot as he levelled his shotgun from his flat window

Blood tests would later reveal him to be three times over the drink-drive limit.

David Hay, the taxi driver, said: ""At that point he turned back round and I gave him his change and he was looking straight at me and just said: 'I'm going to die'.""

""When he looked at me his eyes were large and bulging. I could see the terror in his eyes.""

Half an hour later, Mr Saunders loaded the shotgun he legally owned and fired the first shots from his kitchen window, triggering the five-hour standoff with armed officers of the Metropolitan Police's CO19 firearms unit.

When the fatal shots were fired at half past 2130 BST, Mr Saunders was alone.

Police had refused his wish to talk to his family - fearing he wanted to say goodbye and take his life.

Instead, he was surrounded by broken glass and a wine bottle as he died.","['alcohol', 'shotgun', 'life', 'inquest', 'months', 'saunders', 'told', 'barrister', 'struggle', 'shot', 'mark', 'drinking', 'occasions', 'wife', '20year', 'mr']","'Out of control'By 2005 - three years before his death - Mr Saunders was drinking to excess most nights.

Sadie Frost says Mirror hacking caused 'living hell',"Actress Sadie Frost tells a hearing phone hacking by Mirror Group journalists made her life ""a living hell"" for many years.",[],None,"Image copyright BBC Sport Image caption Frost said hacking by Mirror journalists affected her relationship with fellow actor Jude Law

Actress Sadie Frost has told the High Court that having her phone hacked by Mirror Group journalists made her life a ""living hell"".

Describing the experience as the ""lowest of the low"", the 49-year-old actress and businesswoman said she did not know who to trust.

In 2003, she had a breakdown and went into hospital, which was a ""terrible"" incident but ended up in the papers.

Ms Frost is among eight high-profile figures claiming damages for hacking.

She told the court: ""Your father is dying, you are going through divorce, you have postnatal depression, you are in and out of hospital, my baby was ill, he was born premature.

""I was at breaking point, I could not sleep, or eat, and I did not know who to trust as information kept getting into the media.

""I needed my loved ones around me. I was very upset, I was a very, very unhappy person.

""Every time I turned to someone to confide in them, it ended up in the newspapers, which added to my distress and trauma.""

""I couldn't go and sit with my mum and have a cup of tea because I thought she was selling stories. I didn't trust my own mother.""

'Panic attacks'

Ms Frost said her separation from fellow actor Jude Law was very difficult.

""I thought it might be Jude, trying to make me look bad for custody reasons, or my friends or family using me for their own gains. Either thought was heartbreaking.

""This was a deeply stressful time in my life and the fact my insecurities were being publicised obviously made it worse.""

She described how friends, particularly model Kate Moss, questioned whether they could trust her.

""Even worse than that, Jude, the father of my children, thought for years that I was selling stories which created an animosity between us that has only really disappeared since the revelations about phone hacking.""

Image caption Sadie Frost said she was 'humiliated' when a story emerged about her attending an AA meeting

Ms Frost said: ""I couldn't take my youngest son to the park for two years because he was photographed. He would cry and I would get panic attacks.

""I lost two to three years of my life, they wanted me to fail.

She told the hearing that it felt like she and those closest to her were ""being monitored and hunted down by a sort of secret police"".

""Every area of my life was affected. There was nowhere I could go that was safe.""

""If I went to the doctor or gynaecologist, details would be in the newspaper.""

'Embarrassed and humiliated'

Ms Frost said she was left ""incredibly embarrassed and humiliated"" when a story emerged about her attending an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

She said she had been advised to go a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous ""because it was a safe place"".

""Someone quite high-profile took me there and I went there after everyone said it would be safe and anonymous,"" she told the court.

""I was portrayed as troubled, sad, as a party-girl. That's not why people go to AA, they go there to get help and be in a safe place.""

She added: ""I was portrayed for so long as a complete mess that I have had to overcome people's perception of me to rebuild my reputation as a successful businesswoman. I can only guess at the position I would be in if none of this had happened.""

She said that the apology she had received from Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) was ""rather too little too late"".

The hearing at the High Court in London is considering what compensation should be paid by MGN to Ms Frost, alongside BBC creative director Alan Yentob, soap stars Shane Richie, Shobna Gulati and Lucy Taggart, former footballer Paul Gascoigne, TV producer Robert Ashworth and flight attendant Lauren Alcorn.","['trust', 'jude', 'mirror', 'caused', 'thought', 'court', 'sadie', 'told', 'went', 'safe', 'hacking', 'frost', 'life', 'hell', 'living']","Image copyright BBC Sport Image caption Frost said hacking by Mirror journalists affected her relationship with fellow actor Jude LawActress Sadie Frost has told the High Court that having her phone hacked by Mirror Group journalists made her life a ""living hell"".

How jeans giant Levi Strauss got its mojo back,The US clothing firm is now enjoying five years of profit growth as it recovers from past woes.,"['Russell Hotten', 'Business Reporter', 'Bbc News']",None,"Image copyright Levi Strauss

Chip Bergh has the air of man at ease with the world. But things could have turned out very different, given what he calls his ""dysfunctional"" childhood.

The 60-year-old chief executive of Levi Strauss, dressed in regulation blue jeans and denim shirt, readily admits to be being ""blessed and lucky"".

Six years into his successful turnaround of the once struggling US clothing firm, he says the job still gives him a ""wow"" feeling.

Mr Bergh and his family also love their San Francisco lifestyle, where the vegan boss pursues a passion for marathons and triathlons.

So, professionally and personally, things are going well for the former Procter & Gamble (P&G) executive.

But growing up in the suburbs of New York City there were times when he felt neither blessed nor lucky.

Mr Bergh's father was an advertising salesman working 14-hour days. He was also an alcoholic.

Image copyright Devaki Knowles

There could be ""lots of screaming and yelling"" at home, Mr Bergh recalls. ""Mum and dad were always getting in fights.""

One day his mother threatened to throw out his dad. ""That was a wake up call,"" says Mr Bergh.

His father then finally went to Alcoholics Anonymous, cleaned himself up and never touched another drop.

""I'm proud that my dad recovered,"" says Mr Bergh. ""He rebuilt his life.""

Mr Bergh's childhood wasn't unhappy. ""I had a lot of friends, played a lot of sport, and went to a great school,"" he says. But as the eldest of three children he says he shouldered much of the domestic discord, and grew up fast.

It left its mark and is in part behind his drive to succeed, he thinks. It also left a determination not to repeat some of his father's mistakes.

""I'm pretty level-headed,"" says Mr Bergh. ""There's not a lot that really upsets me. I'm not a yeller and screamer, at home or work. I'm pretty relaxed."" And he doesn't drink.

Image copyright Levi Strauss Image caption Levi Strauss emigrated to the US from Germany in 1853 when he was 18

So, how does Mr Bergh sum up his management style? ""Very open, honest, transparent. What you see is what you get.""

He insists he's ""really down to earth"", adding: ""I put my pants on the same way everybody else does - one leg at a time.""

Just don't confuse this regular-guy image with a lack of steel, as Mr Bergh's overhaul of Levi's has been radical, some might say brutal.

The company was created in 1873 when San Francisco-based wholesale merchant Levi Strauss and a business partner patented a way to strengthen denim trousers using copper rivets. The rest as they say is history.

Through slick advertising and campaigning on social and political issues (such as donating millions to HIV/Aids charities), Levi's punched above its weight for decades.

Stories were common in the 1960s and 1970s of young Westerners packing Levi's jeans in their luggage to help barter their way through holidays behind the Iron Curtain.

If ever a brand deserved the label ""iconic"", Levi's was it.

Image copyright Levi Strauss Image caption The Levi 501 jeans are arguably the company's single most important product

But by the time Mr Bergh took over in 2011, the company he calls the original Silicon Valley start-up ""had lost its way"".

Annual sales peaked in 1997 at $7.1bn (£5.3bn). ""We were bigger than Nike then,"" says Mr Bergh. ""Nike aspired to be like Levi's.""

But Levi's lost its knack of combining heritage with changing trends, and by the early 2000s sales had fallen to $4bn.

Competition from the likes of Walmart and Gap had increased rapidly. Levi had also borrowed heavily, chiefly to buy out scores of Strauss family descendants, and consolidate ownership.

The result, says Mr Bergh, was that the firm found it had to ""cut costs, cut marketing, to save cash"".

Levi's board ultimately decided it needed a fresh pair of hands, and so turned to Mr Bergh, who had the brand expertise and international experience it wanted.

After 28 years at P&G, most latterly working on the Old Spice deodorant and razors accounts, Mr Bergh saw a chance to fulfil an ambition to become a chief executive.

""It was too good an opportunity to pass,"" he says. ""It was an opportunity to make a difference, and leave a legacy.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chip Bergh is not afraid to ""double denim""

All too aware that Levi's was struggling, Mr Bergh sent the firm's then top 60 managers six questions about the pros and cons of the business - and started interviewing each of them.

""But by about the 15th interview it was pretty clear what needed to be done,"" he says. ""There was no strategy, there was no alignment across the organisation... People were frustrated.""

More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world:

Mr Bergh invested in facilities, broadened the clothing range (especially womenswear), and expanded in relatively untapped markets such as Russia, China and India.

The ecommerce operation, previously outsourced and treated almost as an after-thought, was brought in-house, modernised and expanded.

Mr Bergh also changed the top team at the business. Within 18 months of his appointment, nine of the 11-member executive team had left. Of the current 150 senior managers, two-thirds have been with the company for three years or less.

He says: ""We needed to change not just the business but the culture, and the best way to change the culture is to change the leadership.""

Mr Bergh admits the clear out was dramatic, sometimes traumatic, but says: ""You always have to do the harder right than the easier wrong.""

Did he learn such decisiveness in the army, which he joined for two years after school? Making quick decisions was certainly part of the skill-set, he says. But the army also taught him about leadership.

""It's wrong that the army is all about deference and saluting seniors,"" he says. ""You have to earn respect, build trust, be willing to make decisions, coach people and train people - all those skills are transferable to the corporate world.""

The army's downside was that promotion moved slowly, and Mr Bergh wanted to ""move ahead quickly"". A recruitment firm found him a job at P&G.

Levi's turnaround seems to be succeeding, with 2017 expected to see the fifth consecutive year of profits growth.

Retail analyst Marshal Cohen, of market research group NPD, says that yet again Levi's has been able to ""reinvent"" itself to a new generation.

However, Mr Bergh says the job is far from finished. ""We have made really good progress. It's been harder and taken longer than I expected.

Angela Wrightson: Killer girls bid to extend anonymity,The two girls were just 13 and 14 when they murdered vulnerable Angela Wrightson in 2014.,[],None,"Image caption Angela Wrightson suffered more than 70 separate slash injuries and 54 blunt-force injuries

Two girls who were 13 and 14 when they murdered a vulnerable alcoholic in her own home are taking legal action to remain anonymous into adulthood.

Angela Wrightson, 39, was subjected to a seven-hour attack in her Hartlepool home by the pair in December 2014.

Both girls, who were not named in court because of their age, were jailed for a minimum of 15 years in April 2016.

The High Court is due to consider whether the ban on identifying the killers can be extended indefinitely.

The girls' legal team has already obtained an interim injunction extending their anonymity, although one of them has now turned 18.

Image copyright Cleveland Police Image caption The two girls returned to Ms Wrightson's home in the early hours of 9 December, where they would continue the attack

The original trial judge, Mr Justice Globe, imposed reporting restrictions preventing the media from identifying the girls, on account of them being under 18 and due to their vulnerability.

The issue will go before the High Court next month, where their legal teams will argue the media's ban on reporting their identities should be extended.

The current interim injunction applies to media reports, and all other internet postings.

Mr Justice Globe halted a first trial at Teesside Crown Court and imposed a ban on reporting the second hearing months later in Leeds after he was alerted to hundreds of social media posts written about the girls.

He later described them as ""a blitz of extreme and disturbing comments posted on Facebook by members of the public"".

Ms Wrightson, known locally as Alco Angela, was attacked after allowing the girls into her Stephen Street home to drink alcohol.

Image copyright Cleveland Police Image caption The girls dropped a TV on Angela Wrightson's head

A subsequent inquiry into the case found care home staff could not lock doors to prevent the older girl from running away and it heard that she had a chaotic family life.

The younger girl had been placed in foster care after her parents complained of being unable to cope.

Both girls were known to drink and take drugs.

After the attack, the girls boasted to friends about being given a lift home by police, who were unaware of the murder.","['anonymity', 'wrightson', 'reporting', 'caption', 'killer', 'image', 'court', 'legal', 'ban', 'girls', 'extend', 'media', 'angela', 'bid']","Image caption Angela Wrightson suffered more than 70 separate slash injuries and 54 blunt-force injuriesTwo girls who were 13 and 14 when they murdered a vulnerable alcoholic in her own home are taking legal action to remain anonymous into adulthood.

State must 'go further' to help addicts,"The state should do more to help addicts and make them employable, Iain Duncan Smith says, with removing benefits a ""hypothetical"" option.",[],None,"Image copyright SPL Image caption Some say withdrawing benefits from drug users would lead them into crime

The state should intervene further to help drug and alcohol addicts recover and make them employable in future, a senior cabinet minister has said.

In a speech to Alcoholics Anonymous, Iain Duncan Smith argued that addicts who are unable to work are being let down by the welfare system.

The BBC understands removing benefits from people refusing treatment will be an option but a ""hypothetical"" one.

One drug charity said such a move would set a ""dangerous precedent"".

In 2010, the Home Office considered plans to remove benefits from addicts who refused treatment as part of the government's drug strategy but these were not pursued.

According to the Department for Work and Pensions, 40,000 people claim incapacity benefits - citing alcoholism as their primary condition. Of these, about a third have been claiming for more than a decade.

The government also says 80% of the UK's 400,000 ""problem drug users"" are claiming out-of-work benefits.

'Road to recovery'

In a speech in Parliament, Mr Duncan Smith said ""the outdated benefits system fails to get people off drugs and put their lives on track"".

""We have started changing how addicts are supported but we must go further to actively take on the devastation that drugs and alcohol can cause.

""We want to do more to encourage and support claimants into rehabilitation for addiction and starting them on the road to recovery and eventually work.""

There is no evidence that using the stick of benefit sanctions will help people to positively engage with treatment and support their recovery Martin Barnes, DrugScope

Mr Duncan Smith said the introduction of a single, consolidated benefit known as Universal Credit from next year - more details of which will be published on Thursday - will simplify the benefits system and provide more financial incentives for employment, helping all claimants.

""Getting people into work and encouraging independence is our ultimate goal,"" he added.

""Universal Credit will put people on a journey towards sustainable recovery so they are better placed to look for work in future.""

The BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason said Mr Duncan Smith, in his speech, hinted that a lack of willingness to seek help for addictions could lead to a cut in benefits.

But a source close to the minister emphasised that the universal credit would make it easier to ""track people through the system"" and ensure they get the help they need.

""Hypothetically people could lose benefits,"" the source told the BBC. ""You do have to have sanctions. But very few people refuse treatment.""

'No evidence'

Charities said many addicts were not receiving the support they needed at job centres and through the government's flagship welfare-to-work programme.

One of these, DrugScope, said it would be asking ministers to ""clarify"" their position on sanctions for refusing treatment.

""We are surprised and concerned at reports that ministers believe that stopping benefits is an appropriate or effective way of engaging people with drug or alcohol treatment and supporting their recovery,"" said its chief executive Martin Barnes

""If accurate, this would be a reversal of the government's publicly stated position.""

It said ministers had dropped plans, proposed by the previous Labour government, to require all those attending job centres to answer questions about possible drug and alcohol use.

""There is no evidence that using the stick of benefit sanctions will help people to positively engage with treatment and support their recovery,"" Mr Barnes added.

""Indeed, the risk is that people will disengage from support services, potentially worsening their dependency and the impacts on their families and communities. Linking benefit to a requirement to undergo treatment would set a dangerous precedent for people with physical or mental health problems.""

All those claiming employment and support allowance - which has replaced incapacity benefit - are currently being re-assessed under plans aimed at getting more people into work and reducing the welfare bill.

Former alcoholic 'scared' by rise in young drinkers,"A recovering alcoholic from Norfolk says he is ""scared"" by the rise in the number of young people with drink problems.","['Jo Thewlis', 'Bbc News']",None,"Image caption Recovering alcoholic Patrick Martin is 'scared' by the rise in the number of young drinkers

A recovering alcoholic from Norfolk says he is ""scared"" by the rise in the number of young people with drink problems at his support group.

Patrick Martin, 64, once drank a litre of vodka a day at the height of his alcohol addiction.

Mr Martin, who has been sober for three years, has lost two partners to alcohol-related illnesses.

Now he is worried by the rise in the number of young people at his Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

""We are getting more young people at meetings, particularly young women,"" he said.

""They are getting really ill through drinking and it scares me for future generations.

""My heart goes out to them. I wish I could tell them what I've been through.""

'Wallowed in sadness'

Mr Martin, who lives in Norwich, said he has seen a sharp rise in young people aged between 22 to 28 coming to the group.

I just locked the door, drew the curtains, pulled the telephone wire out and just wallowed in my own sadness Patrick Martin

Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show the rate of alcohol-related deaths for 15 to 34-year-olds in the UK has almost doubled in nearly 20 years.

In 1991, 137 young people aged between 15 and 34 died of alcohol-related problems. Of those, 48 were women.

By 2009, the total number of alcohol-related deaths had risen to 261, of which 94 were women.

""The stories we hear from these young people are harrowing to say the least,"" Mr Martin said.

""They let their hair down at weekends but these weekends tend to get out of hand for a lot of them.""

Mr Martin said his drink problem started to escalate in his late 20s, when he drank as a way to escape the pressure he felt in his work as a pottery designer.

At the height of his addiction, Mr Martin said would sometimes go without eating for two weeks when on a drinking binge.

""I just locked the door, drew the curtains, pulled the telephone wire out and just wallowed in my own sadness,"" he said.

""When you are drinking, your only thoughts from the moment you wake up until the moment you pass out is where you can get your next drink from. Nothing else matters.""

'Rock bottom'

Mr Martin said his alcohol problem has shortened his life and robbed him of his marriage and his relationship with his son.

Two former partners have also died of alcohol-related illnesses in the past six years, he added.

Despite attending Alcoholics Anonymous for almost 30 years, Mr Martin said he decided to stop drinking quite suddenly three-and-a-half years ago.

""I just put the drink down one day,"" he said. ""I had reached my rock bottom and climbed back up but a lot of people don't.""

Mr Martin, who has now retired for health reasons, is calling for better education to help stem the rising tide of young drinkers.

""You are not going to stop people drinking by putting alcohol prices up,"" he said.

""If you are desperate for alcohol, you will steal to get it.

""I don't think the health services or Government take the problem seriously enough or realise how serious it will be in a few years.

""If they carry on drinking, a lot of these young people will be in the same boat as me in 10 years time.""","['martin', 'alcohol', 'rise', 'problem', 'drinkers', 'drink', 'young', 'alcoholic', 'drinking', 'scared', 'number', 'alcoholrelated', 'mr']","Image caption Recovering alcoholic Patrick Martin is 'scared' by the rise in the number of young drinkersA recovering alcoholic from Norfolk says he is ""scared"" by the rise in the number of young people with drink problems at his support group.

Michael Le Vell: Street star's 'demons' laid bare in trial,"Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell is cleared of child sex offences, but his trial revealed the darker side of his personal life.",[],None,"Image caption Michael Le Vell was described in court as a ""heavy drinker [who] went out most nights""

Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell has been cleared of child sex abuse offences after a trial at Manchester Crown Court that lasted more than a week. On the steps of the court, after the jury had found him not guilty of 12 charges, his relief was obvious.

""I might go and have a drink now, believe it or not,"" was how Mr Le Vell finished his brief statement to the gathered media.

It was a remark that raised a laugh with his supporters but, as had been clear in the trial, it pointed to a dark side of the star's private life.

The 48-year-old actor, tried under his real name Michael Turner, had confessed his inner demons - alcoholism and adultery - during his time in the witness box.

'Troubled life'

The indication is clear that he is going back to Coronation Street and why not? Nigel Pivaro, Ex-Coronation Street actor

However, the star who plays Kevin Webster in the ITV soap maintained throughout he had never sexually assaulted or raped a child.

The judge had warned jurors not to confuse the man in the dock with his TV role as the car mechanic he has played for 30 years, watched by nine million viewers a week.

Mr Le Vell told the court his role had allowed him to live a ""luxury, charmed"" existence, but that on-screen fame hid what prosecutors said was a ""troubled"" life.

During cross-examination, he admitted he was an alcoholic and for 30 years had been ""drinking about seven or eight pints a night"" in the pub.

He told the court he had attended Alcoholics Anonymous ""one or two times"" but had given up on each occasion after just a few weeks.

In court, Mr Le Vell claimed his drinking was the result of his ""working-class mentality"" and confessed he had only been able to continue acting because his job had ""cocooned"" him.

'One-night stands'

The verdict came at the end of a trial which had seen the prosecutor remind the jury the case concerned neither Coronation Street's Kevin Webster nor Michael Le Vell.

Image caption Mr Le Vell has played garage mechanic Kevin Webster in the popular soap since 1983

""The man on trial is Michael Turner,"" chief prosecutor Eleanor Laws QC said.

During his trial, the jury heard how Mr Le Vell had cheated on his wife while she was undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer, in a parallel with his on-screen character, and he had had a string of one-night stands.

By coincidence, his character Kevin Webster had an affair with a character called Molly Dobbs while his on-screen wife, Sally Webster, developed breast cancer.

Such plot developments came a long time after Mr Turner started acting at school, aged 12, later becoming a member of Oldham Theatre Workshop, adopting the stage name of Le Vell along the way.

In 1981, he got his break, joining Coronation Street in a minor role for a few episodes. Two years later, he was cast as mechanic Kevin Webster.

As producers sought to win younger audiences Kevin and his two mates - bad-boy Terry Duckworth (played by Nigel Pivaro) and dreamer with intellectual pretensions Curly Watts (Kevin Kennedy) became a hit with fans.

Star's personal drama

Only Mr Le Vell has lasted in ""The Street"" and fans of the soap opera have followed his stormy relationship with Sally, played by Sally Dynevor.

Image caption Mr Le Vell's trial lasted seven days and ended with his acquittal on all charges

Such was his prominence, he had a major part in 2010's live 50th anniversary episode, which featured a fatal tram crash in Weatherfield, with his performance leading to a Best Actor nomination at the 2011 British Soap Awards.

Within months of that on-screen drama though, Mr Le Vell was dealing with his own crisis as he was arrested over child sex allegations.

He ""strenuously"" denied the claims and, after considering the case, the Crown Prosecution Service made the decision not to bring charges against him, in January 2012.

At the time, Mr Le Vell praised Greater Manchester Police for a ""fair, thorough and independent investigation"", adding that he was ""delighted to be completely exonerated"" by the decision to take no further action.

A year later however, the principal legal adviser to the Director of Public Prosecutions overturned the decision and brought a prosecution case against him.

'He's been exonerated'

Again, Mr Le Vell denied the accusations and said they were ""an absolute pack of lies"" which he would ""fight vigorously"".

During the trial, the prosecution put it to Mr Le Vell his witness box performance was just an act.

But a jury of eight women and four men did not believe he was acting and the actor left the court a free man.

His on-screen and off-screen friend Mr Pivaro sees no reason why Mr Le Vell cannot resume his Coronation Street career.

""I think the indication is clear that he is going back to Coronation Street and why not? He's been exonerated,"" said Mr Pivaro.

""We'll see, but let's face it, who amongst us can say that we are whiter than white, squeaky clean?

'How I lost my dad to alcohol addiction',"Exclusive music news, big interviews, entertainment, social media trends and video from the news people at BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra.",['Interview Hannah Moore'],None,"When Charlotte's dad was taken to hospital he couldn't open his mouth any more.

His face was paralysed and his heart and liver had become enlarged after years of drinking far too much alcohol.

Then one by one, his internal organs shut down. He died just before Christmas last year, aged 59.

But Charlotte, 27, tells Newsbeat she feels like she lost him to alcohol addiction years ago.

""In your teenage years you become more aware of your parents' behaviour,"" she says.

""I'd realise that finding bottles of wine hidden behind the sofa isn't normal. Finding dad passed out in front of the television at two o'clock in the morning isn't normal.""

I'd realise that finding bottles of wine hidden behind the sofa isn't normal

Hiding it

Charlotte was about 15 when she realised her dad, Iain Hayman, was having problems with alcohol.

""The older I got the more I realised his relationship with alcohol was incredibly unhealthy because he was hiding it. He'd lie to mum and say, 'I haven't had a drink today' and you'd think, 'I saw you earlier. Yes you did.'

""We never knew how much he was drinking. It started off with a bottle of wine a night and then it would go up to three or four.

""Every time you find a bottle of wine you struggle with 'Do I dob him in and cause an argument or do I lie to my mum?'

""The more you tidied, the more you found out about dad.""

'It's quite an embarrassing illness'

Charlotte explains how her father was effectively ""living two lives"".

""I'd come home from school and he'd be asleep in bed. He'd be really down,"" she says.

""It was a slow deterioration. Every time he felt positive you really wanted to get behind him and support him, which is what he needed..

I'll have days when I remember the nice things, and then there are days when I have the horrible memories

""But the more it happened and the more he failed, it became difficult to put that aside.

""He was living two lives because until I was 18 it didn't really come out that he was an alcoholic

""He hid very well that he wasn't paying the mortgage [on our house].

""It came out that we were really close to losing the house. We had bailiffs knocking on the door.

""I was working in the village pub and you'd often be told stories like 'Charlotte, I saw your dad passed out on the path and I almost tripped over him.'

""It's quite an embarrassing illness for your parent to have because they lose their inhibitions and don't care what people think of them.""

Daddy's girl

""I was a proper daddy's girl. We were very close.

Your teenage years are difficult enough. To have that as an extra worry, you just don't need it.

""I have so many nice memories of him. I'll have days when I remember the nice things, and then there are days when I have the horrible memories and I think of him drunk, and I think of him not able to stop for us.

""It's a mixed bag of emotions because you have the anger that he did this to himself.""

Role reversal

""It was a role reversal because you end up looking out for him and making sure he gets ready for the day. And then always worrying about what he was doing.

""Your teenage years are difficult enough. To have that as an extra worry, you just don't need it.

""You should be able to rely on your parents to help you and support you, and it just wasn't there [from him]. Emotionally it's very difficult.""

I distanced myself from him

After years of struggling with the effects of Iain's addiction, Charlotte's mum decided she couldn't take any more. She asked him to move out of their home last year.

Sadly, that's when his drinking increased. He'd lost his job and even began stealing alcohol.

""In the last year I distanced myself from him because I found it too difficult. You really wanted to get behind him and support him, but the more he failed [to stop drinking] it became difficult to put that aside.

""He was in a bad way again, he was out of breath. And then he ended up fainting, got an ambulance to the hospital, and then he never came out.

""He couldn't even talk for the last three weeks of his life.

""You have this anger that he's done this to himself. But we all just had to put it to one side and we just had to be forgiving.

""Now we can grieve the man we lost when I was a teenager.""

Lindsay Lohan's chequered life in the spotlight,"As actress Lindsay Lohan is given a prison sentence for probation violation, a look at the Hollywood star's career and troubled life lived in the spotlight.",[],None,"Image caption Good times, bad times: Lindsay Lohan receives an award in 2004 and learns of her prison term in 2010

The latest chapter in Hollywood actress Lindsay Lohan's chequered life was, like many others, played out in front of the camera.

The 24-year-old wept into her lawyer's shoulder in a Los Angeles courtroom as she was handed a 90-day prison sentence for probation violation, relating to a drugs charge dating back to 2007.

Lohan's life in front of the lens began at a very early age.

Born Lindsay Dee Lohan in the Bronx, New York, on 2 July, 1986, she became a child model at the age of three, appearing in Vogue, Elle and a string of television commercials for the likes of Pizza Hut and The Gap.

Image caption Lohan shot to fame as a fresh-faced Disney film star

By the age of 10, she had landed a role in US soap opera Another World, a fertile breeding ground for new talent, which also give early roles to Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt.

Lohan made her feature film debut just a year later in squeaky clean Disney hit The Parent Trap.

Her life in film progressed smoothly and wholesomely, with critically-approved comedy roles in Freaky Friday, teen hit Mean Girls and Herbie Fully Loaded adding to her profile.

Annus horribilis

A fresh-faced Lohan picked up an impressive clutch of Teen Choice and MTV Movie Award gongs.

She branched out in 2004, becoming the youngest host of the MTV award ceremony, and developed an increasingly high profile away from the confines of Hollywood's film sets.

Her apparent weight loss and a string of car accidents created tabloid headlines, and the paparazzi began to trail the young star around Los Angeles.

Lohan, meanwhile, continued to diversify. She had sung the closing song in Disney's remake of Freaky Friday, which resulted in a record contract.

Her debut album, Speak, was released in 2004 and made it to number four in the US album chart.

Image caption Lohan (left) won high praise for her role in fish-out-of-water high school comedy Mean Girls

Her follow-up a year later also proved a hit, and was a more soul-searching, confessional record about her relationship with her family, which she admitted had been a difficult one.

Songwriting, Lohan said, was a way of finding escape from the increasing pressures of her life in the Hollywood goldfish bowl.

Cameo roles followed in more adult-orientated films, including A Prairie Home Companion and Bobby - but Lohan's reputation for enjoying the high life grew in 2006 when she was rebuked for late arrivals on the set of the film Georgia Rules.

The film's producer suggested in a letter, leaked to the press, that the actress's ""heat exhaustion"" was simply the result of ""ongoing all night heavy partying"".

She began to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and admitted herself to a rehabilitation clinic in early 2007 - in what proved to be an annus horribilis for the star.

Lohan was arrested twice for driving and drug offences and had two more stints in rehab. A jail sentence was imposed but she spent only 84 minutes behind bars, and was forced to visit a mortuary to learn the impact of drink-driving.

While her personal life was splashed across the front pages, her film career was hitting a low point.

Grisly psychological thriller I Know Who Killed Me was mauled by the critics - The New York Post branded it ""sleazy, inept and worthless - and Lohan was given the dubious honour of a Razzie award for worst performance.

Image caption Lohan's liaison with Samantha Ronson was followed closely by the press

Subsequent years saw Lohan drift into smaller TV roles, including fronting a BBC documentary about child trafficking, while the tabloid headlines kept rolling in.

She had a much-publicised relationship with DJ Samantha Ronson, but refused to answer questions about her sexuality.

The couple's subsequent break-up saw Lohan take the unusual step of putting out a spoof video dating advert, introducing herself as ""a workaholic, a shopaholic and, according to the state of California, an alcoholic"".

Lohan also joked about her ongoing probation and the ever-growing number of Google searches about her private life.

In recent months, the actress has gained further notoriety for brushes with the legal system and her apparently wayward lifestyle.

She missed a routine court appearance, unable to return from the Cannes Film Festival after losing her passport. An initial warrant for her arrest was later revoked.

Lohan was later ordered to wear an alcohol monitoring bracelet as part of her probation deal, which activated during an MTV Movie Awards party.

The final path to jail was laid when she failed to attend alcohol education classes, although she insisted she had done ""everything I was told to do"".

After a stint in jail and court-ordered rehabilitation, the future looks uncertain for Lohan.

Her recent foray into fashion was not a resounding success, while a question hangs over her movie career.

Lohan had been lined up to play 1970s porn legend Linda Lovelace, a world away from the squeaky clean roles which originally propelled her into the spotlight.

Shot Chelsea lawyer Mark Saunders 'asked for his wife',The widow of a barrister who was shot dead by police during a stand-off tells an inquest she could have defused the situation.,[],None,"Image caption Mr Saunders' family say he posed no real risk to the public

The widow of an alcoholic barrister who was shot dead by police during a stand-off told an inquest she could have defused the situation.

Mark Saunders, 32, was hit in the head and chest by five police bullets at his Chelsea home in May 2008.

Elizabeth Saunders told Westminster Coroner's Court: ""I know that Mark would never, ever have hurt me.""

Mr Saunders asked negotiators if he could speak to his wife, but she said police told her to turn her phone off.

Mrs Saunders, also a barrister at QEB chambers, said that her husband told their senior clerk he had been ""firing his gun and that the police were coming and he was in trouble"" in a phone call shortly before 1700 BST.

Blank text

She made her way home but was stopped at the police cordon. Officers then asked her to switch off her mobile phone.

She said she heard a ""lot of commotion"" but did not know her husband was dead until 2230 BST.

Later when she switched on her phone, she found a blank text from him.

Image caption Mark Saunders' family say he posed no risk to the public

Mrs Saunders said: ""That would have been the only time in our relationship that he sent me a text message and he did not get an immediate call from me saying, 'Darling, I am here'.

""That is very difficult for me, but there it is. I did not know he had called.""

She told the inquest: ""The truth of our relationship was Mark and I loved each other.

""I think he would have just said 'Darling, I am sorry'. And I would have said 'Sweetheart, it is OK. Do not worry, we will sort this out'.""

The inquest also heard that Mr Saunders had texted Alex Booth, the best man at his wedding, during the stand-off.

The message said: ""This is the end, my only friend, the end.""

Mr Booth told the court they would often quote films and music to each other, and the message appeared to be quoting from a song by The Doors used in the film Apocalypse Now.

The hearing was told Mr Saunders had been attending Alcoholics Anonymous and sought help from his GP to control his drinking.

The family law expert had been prescribed anti-depressants and had also taken cocaine in the months leading up to his death.

'Love for life'

Mrs Saunders said she thought he had been drinking heavily on the day of his killing.

She said her husband was a ""very sensitive and caring man"" with ""huge energy and love for life"".

Mrs Saunders said he had been teetotal apart from a few ""blips"".

She said: ""There were occasions, probably every three months or so, when it went wrong.""

On the day of his death Mr Saunders had been out on various errands and seemed ""very happy"".

Cab driver David Hay, who dropped him later in the day, told the inquest: ""He looked straight at me, and just said, 'I'm going to die'.""

'What I learned from confronting my alcoholic mum',"Exclusive music news, big interviews, entertainment, social media trends and video from the news people at BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra.",['Hannah Moore'],None,"Caitlin Croft was 12 when she first tried to talk to her mum Tracey about her alcohol problem.

Every afternoon after work, Tracey would lock herself in her room and drink until she fell asleep, normally having a bottle of vodka a night.

Caitlin, now 17, found it hard to confront her mum. But it was worthwhile because, after more than a decade of addiction, Tracey's now in recovery and hasn't had a drink for eight months.

Here's what Caitlin has learned.

Anyone can have alcohol problems

Seeing her mum's struggle with alcohol made Caitlin realise that anyone can get addicted.

""When you picture an alcoholic you don't think of an 'ordinary' person,"" says Caitlin.

""You'd think of a homeless person having those problems, not a normal average person with a family and home.""

But it's not uncommon. The government says around 1.6 million adults in England have some level of alcohol dependence.

And almost 11 million are drinking enough to harm their health.

Despite drinking heavily every night, Tracey managed to keep her job.

So from the outside it may not have been obvious she had a problem.

Ignoring the addiction won't make it go away

For several months Caitlin avoided talking to her mum about her addiction.

""Every night I'd be in my room on my own, and I knew my mum would be next door drunk,"" she explains.

""I told myself so many times that if I just ignore it she'll get better. But I just saw it getting worse.""

I told myself so many times that if I just ignore it she'll get better

So Caitlin says she learned to confront Tracey in the mornings when she was sober, instead of talking to her while she was drunk.

""Then she could understand me a bit more,"" she says.

""I learned that it's easier to get everything out in the open, rather than hiding it and pretending it will just go away.""

Make sure you've got evidence

Telling someone they've got an alcohol problem is a serious thing to do.

You need to think carefully about what you will say to them, Caitlin explains.

""I couldn't just accuse mum of being drunk.

She thought she was hiding it, but I knew when she was drunk

""I didn't know what type of mood she would be in, so I always used to plan in my head how I was going to [approach her].""

She says she realised that her mum may not have known how much she was drinking.

""She was in denial and she thought she was hiding it, but I knew when she was drunk.

""So I used to tear her room apart looking for bottles.

""I found 10, 20 bottles hidden under her bed, under her pillow, in her drawers.

""Then I had evidence. It was clear she had been drinking, and then it was harder for her to deny it.""

Tracey tells Newsbeat this approach helped her confront her problem. But it wouldn't work for everyone with alcohol dependency.

Encourage them to get help

Tracey started to drink heavily after her husband left the family.

""Over time I started to understand why she had a drink problem,"" explains Caitlin.

A lot of people don't understand that it's an illness

""It affected my mum's health - mentally, physically and emotionally.""

Caitlin and her older brothers encouraged their mum to seek medical help.

Tracey's drinking had left her with an inflamed liver, a condition which can be life threatening.

She was also suffering mental problems, and ended up spending a lot of time in hospital.

""A lot of people don't understand that it's an illness, just like anything else you get diagnosed with.

""So even though it's hard you have to see it from their point of view.""

Get support for yourself, too

Alcohol dependency doesn't just damage the person who is drinking. It affects everyone around them.

""It's not nice to see your mum in that position and there's not really a lot you can do to help,"" says Caitlin.

""It was tiring to see her not making any improvements.""

Caitlin says she found it helpful to talk to her friends and to her older brothers.

And she moved in with one of them when Tracey's illness was at its worst, which helped her concentrate on the other parts of her life like revising for her GCSEs.

Together, the family helped Tracey to get better.

Eight unhelpful things to say to an alcoholic,"Exclusive music news, big interviews, entertainment, social media trends and video from the news people at BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra.","['Interviews Hannah Moore', 'Declan Harvey']",None,"It's painful to see someone you love struggle with alcohol addiction.

And it's easy to get angry about how their behaviour is affecting the people around them.

But if you want to help, you need to know the right things to say.

Newsbeat asked three recovering alcoholics to explain what didn't help them, and what they wish their families had said.

1. Why do you need to drink?

""At first I'd say, 'Because I like it,'"" Tracey says.

Her husband had just left the family and she thought alcohol was helping her numb the pain.

But when her children asked her why she was drinking, she became resentful.

She says as a result she even increased the amount she was drinking.

""They were trying to be helpful but to me they weren't because I was in denial.""

But as time went on, she became scared of the addiction.

""I got more open because I was frightened, and I could say, 'I don't know how to stop any more. I need help.'""

She says it's important to try to understand the reasons behind someone's drinking problem, and try not to be judgemental.

2. Why can't you just stop?

Alcoholics can be physically addicted, meaning their body has come to rely on alcohol to feel ""normal"".

Stopping suddenly can lead to withdrawal symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations and seizures.

""I just couldn't stop. Not at the time. Medically I couldn't,"" says Tracey.

""You can go into fits if you stop just like that.""

She was drinking a bottle of vodka a night and would have panic attacks if there was no booze in the house.

""People need to understand it's an illness,"" Tracey insists.

It can take between three months and a year to fully recover from the effects of alcohol withdrawal.

Tracey managed to quit because her family took her to the GP. She spent time in hospital and was put on medication to help.

3. You're selfish

As families grow tired of an alcoholic's drinking, they can often start to criticise them more aggressively.

This made Tracey's behaviour more spiteful, she says.

""I was selfish,"" says Tracey. ""But at the time I couldn't see that.

""It's dreadful to think that's what I used to do. I should have been coming home and thinking, 'What am I going to cook [my daughter] for tea?'

""But all my mind was fixated on was coming home to have a drink.""

Ambrose, who's been off alcohol for nine months, says: ""I could see I was hurting and upsetting people.

""I couldn't cope with feeling guilty so I ended up drinking more to forget that I felt guilty.""

Tracey says it's best to avoid using combative language if you're trying to help someone with an alcohol problem.

Instead, try to be sympathetic.

""I just wanted them to say, 'Look Mum, we know you've got a problem. We're here to help you.'""

4. Don't you love us?

Tracey says her children asked her this often.

""I thought, 'What a horrible thing to say.'

""I knew I did love them. Why would it change because I've had a drink?

""But obviously I wasn't showing them.""

For Rose, who stopped drinking three years ago, it was ""nothing to do with love"".

""If I was able to have stopped of course I would have.

""It wasn't a choice. It was a necessity,"" she says.

5. How are you able to afford this?

""If I had no electricity I'd ask my mum for help to pay for more,"" remembers Rose.

""And sometimes she'd say, 'Oh - but you can afford drink.'

""Unfortunately she was probably right. But it doesn't help.""

6. Shouting and screaming

""Get yourself together"" and ""you're a mother for God's sake.""

Rose remembers these words being shouted at her but she says she only had time to reflect once the shouting stopped.

""There was silence and it gave me room to think.

""Calmly people said to me, 'We're so worried about you. You're going to die. We don't know what to do.'

""I wanted to die in my sleep. I couldn't see how I could ever stop drinking.

""But the silence let me see the pain my family were going through.""

7. We won't drink either

Rose finds it patronising when she goes for dinner with friends and someone says something like, ""none of us are going to drink either"".

""They make a huge deal about them not having alcohol. Actually it makes me feel uncomfortable.

""I'd much rather they said something like, 'Oh, do you mind if I have a drink?'

""When people are being obviously super careful it can be difficult.""

Tracey still goes to the pub with her friends but she says she would never expect them not to drink on her behalf.

8. Are you strong enough?

Since he stopped drinking Ambrose says he dislikes when people ask if he's strong enough to stay off it.

""When they ask that I think, 'Cheers mate, thanks for having faith in me.'""

He understands history may have taught people recovery can occasionally have setbacks but he says: ""It's people having negative thoughts and passing them on to me.

""It puts a negative thought in my head and I start to wonder if I'm kidding myself.""

"John McAfee: Addict, coder, runaway","John McAfee speaks to the BBC about his time on the run after his neighbour was found murdered, his addiction to drugs and why he thinks Silicon Valley needs a shake-up.","['Leo Kelion', 'Technology Reporter']",None,"Who is the real John McAfee? He's the man who went on the run after his neighbour was found dead, face-up, with a bullet in his head. He's the man who jump-started the multibillion-dollar anti-virus industry. And now he thinks he can make you invisible on the internet.

Within tech circles he's long been a legend. But for most people, McAfee came to prominence last year when he fled his Central American home - teeth stained, hair dyed, in disguise - rather than let himself be questioned by authorities he accused of being corrupt.

He tells the BBC he had ""no connection whatsoever"" with his neighbour's death. Police say he remains a ""person of interest"".

Back in the US, after posting footage of young female ""friends"" stroking his naked tattooed torso, he now plans to neutralise the NSA's cyber-surveillance system.

It might suggest a crazed, perhaps even deranged, personality. One journalist who has interviewed McAfee many times described him a ""master manipulator"" who lies and deceives.

Image caption John McAfee returned to the US last December after being released from a Guatemalan jail

""I've been called paranoid, schizophrenic, the wild child of Silicon Valley,"" McAfee acknowledges.

But he has a different perspective: ""I'm an entrepreneur. I always have been. I am curious and I enjoy solving problems.

""I think that it's when we step out of the road, step outside the box, become our own person and we walk fearlessly down paths other people wouldn't look at, that true progress comes. And sometimes true beauty as well.

""We're missing that. We're missing the people who have the courage to walk into the wilderness just to see what's there.""

This is how Amy Emshwiller, the teenage ex-prostitute he lived with in Belize, describes him: ""He's sweet, generous. He likes to like adventures. He's serious and usually he has a dark sense of humour. He's generally a sweet guy. He just doesn't like to be [expletive] with.""

So, who is the real John McAfee?

To have any chance of knowing and gaining an informed opinion of what really motivated his erratic-sounding behaviour after the killing of Gregory Faull, you must travel deep into the 68-year-old's past.

Addicted and expelled

Despite his Southern accent, the bleached-blond and goateed businessman is in fact half-British - the son of an Englishwoman who met an American soldier stationed in the UK during World War II.

When she tried to shoot me in the head, what I saw was a frightened child. I'm deaf in one ear now, but I don't have a bullet in my head John McAfee

""I feel as much British as I do American,"" McAfee says. ""There's not much difference between our countries.""

They moved to Virginia when he was young, where he had a troubled childhood. His father was an abusive alcoholic who, when McAfee was aged 15, shot himself dead. In the following years, McAfee says, he too began drinking heavily and taking drugs, but still managed to maintain a promising academic career.

That came to an end in the late 1960s when Northeast State Louisiana State College terminated his PhD in mathematics after it was revealed that he had slept with an undergraduate he was mentoring.

They later married and McAfee turned his skills to a series of programming jobs with some of the biggest tech organisations of the time including Nasa, General Electric, Siemens, Univac and Xerox, all the while continuing to indulge in his addictions.

Image caption John McAfee played up to his bad boy reputation in a video he uploaded in June

""Most of my bosses also used drugs of some kind,"" he says. ""I was in the tech field, after all, we were the leading edge in technology and the leading age in personal experimentation.

""I had to hide it from my mother and sometimes from my wife. But in the work environment - depending on where you worked - in some companies drugs were taken openly at lunchtime in people's offices. It was a bizarre time.""

Image caption McAfee says he has never used anti-virus software

Matters came to a head in the early 1980s after his wife left him, his most recent employer, Omex, let him go and the scale of his drug dependency forced him to seek help.

""It was 1984, the last time that I took drugs, drank alcohol or sold drugs for that matter,"" he says.

""I simply stopped. I started going to an organisation called Alcoholics Anonymous... and that was my last taste of that world.

""However, it is still with me. My body is covered with tattoos from that period. And I'm afraid some of my ideas and concepts and attitudes that were moulded during that time are still with me. That's why people think, perhaps, I'm a little bit off the wall.""

Anti-virus millionaire

Despite his troubles, McAfee managed to land a job at defence contractor Lockheed Martin, where he worked on a classified voice-recognition program.

There he came across an unusual bit of self-replicating code designed to copy itself on to any floppy disk inserted into affected computers. When examined, it contained the message: ""Welcome to the dungeon. Beware of this VIRUS.""

""When I first read about the Pakistani Brain virus, I'd never heard of a virus before, neither had anyone in technology,"" remembers McAfee. ""It fascinated me.""

He worked out a way to disinfect the computers and then spread the cure via the bulletin board system, a precursor to the web.

The challenge inspired him to set up a business of his own: McAfee Associates - a firm that would later be sold, years after he had left, to Intel for more than $7.6bn (£4.7bn).

""I knew the field would become extremely large because people being who they are, there will always be hackers,"" he says.

""There's always going to be someone who likes you and someone who dislikes you. Someone who thinks you're a hero and some that think you're a villain John McAfee

""It's why we have graffiti on the walls of the inner city. People like to deface things. They like to disrupt things.

""So, given that fact, computer viruses were not going to go away and were only going to get worse. I just did what I could to be at the forefront of that industry for as long as I could.""

Despite this, he says, he has never himself used any of the products made by the firm that continues to bear his name.

""I'm constantly under attack, yet I use no software protection.

""I protect myself by constantly changing my IP [internet protocol] address, by not attaching my name to any device I use, and by not going on to sites where you might pick up a virus.

""Porn sites, for example, I just don't go there.

""Secondly, I practise safe computing. If someone sends me an email with a link, I'm not going there until I can call the person to verify that they sent me the email.

""It sounds absurd to live that way, but I would rather trust my own devices and thoughts than someone else's software.""

Image caption John McAfee says he has not taken drugs or drunk alcohol for nearly three decades

After selling his stake in the business in 1994, McAfee went on to found and sell other companies, including an instant messaging system, a firewall provider and a ranch from which he offered flights in ""trikes"" - low-flying, engine-powered cabins suspended from hang-gliders.

Then he headed south.

Research and raid

In 2008, at an age others might be thinking of putting up their feet, McAfee moved to the jungle of Belize with the stated intention of trying to cure another kind of infection.

""I came across a concept called quorum sensing, which is the technique that bacteria use to communicate with each other.

""Up until about 10 years ago we didn't even know that bacteria did communicate, but we find out they have a very sophisticated communication system. I wanted to explore and investigate that to see if we could come up with new antibiotics.""

He picked the area, he says, because the plants that grew along the country's Rio Nuevo river contained compounds that inhibit bacteria from sending chemical signals to each other and thus thwart their ability to co-ordinate an attack.

Things didn't go as planned.

The first sign of trouble was when journalists invited to his Carmelita, Orange Walk, base wrote stories that made clear they did not know what to make of the operation.

Then a falling-out with the microbiologist he was working with, Allison Adonizio, put the project at risk when she quit.

Dr Adonizio, who is now based in Philadelphia, did not want to be interviewed.

In April 2012, matters came to a head when the Belize police force's Gang Suppression Unit raided the research facility.

McAfee says the officers claimed they suspected it was being used to make the illegal psycho-stimulant methamphetamine.

They shot his dog, he says, confiscated both his passport and licensed weapons on the property, and briefly imprisoned him before dropping the charges.

""Under no circumstances did they really believe it was a meth lab,"" he states.

""Everybody knew it was a biotech lab because I had hired half of the people in the village to work there. They all knew what I was doing.

Image caption McAfee's Quorumex project attempted to create new treatments using plants from Belize's jungles

""It's a pirate haven. It's an extremely corrupt and dangerous place.

""I knew this and my friends all advised me against it. I just thought I was smart enough to sidestep it. Unfortunately, I was not.

""I was there for a year and the local politician sent a representative and asked for $2m for a campaign donation. I said no. Two weeks later they raided my compound.""

McAfee says when he was asked a second time for the cash he went on a publicity blitz, posting messages online, and speaking to local and international press about the incident. It became political.

The Belize Times - published by the leading opposition party - suggested the ""barbaric assault"" on McAfee was a ""global black eye"" for the nation and a threat to its tourist industry.

""I do wish that I were smarter socially,"" reflects McAfee.

""I think I have the ability to solve mathematical equations and programming issues very easily, but I am a little bit naive in some social situations. And certainly in Belize I was way naive.""

Image caption Amy Emshwiller moved with John McAfee to the Caribbean town of San Pedro

At the time of the raid, McAfee had begun an affair with a 16-year-old ex-prostitute he had met on Belize Independence Day.

""I was partying, I was drinking, and I went into this bar and the owner said a friend wants to meet me and likes me,"" remembers Amy Emshwiller, who still lives in Belize.

""[He said] can I have your number, and then two weeks later he called me.""

She says he was unaware she was less than a quarter of his age.

""He didn't know how old I was. I lied to him saying I was 18, and he thought it was OK.

I didn't quite realise that his lifestyle would be this older guy surrounded by young girls and bodyguards with guns Chad Essley, Graphic novelist

""I let him fall in love first before I told him my age.

""When I told him he was so [expletive] shocked that he didn't know what to do. He was baffled. And he was like: 'I still love you, I don't know what to do. I'm in love with a young girl.' That's how that happened.""

McAfee's long-term American girlfriend left him. And like many things in his life, the new affair proved complicated.

One night Emshwiller took McAfee's gun. She aimed it at his head, squeezed her eyes shut and pulled the trigger. She missed.

He continued the relationship.

""Amy, for one - and many girls in Belize - has a horrific story of abuse that if I told you, you could not believe it,"" McAfee explains.

""Of course she's not going to be well. Of course she's going to have issues.

""When she tried to shoot me in the head what I saw was a frightened child.

Image caption After the raid on his Carmelita property, McAfee moved to San Pedro on Ambergris Caye island

""What I saw was a confused girl who had been so abused - physically, sexually, emotionally - beyond any description.

""What are you going to do? Throw her out? That doesn't help her.

""All she did was burst my eardrum. I'm deaf in one ear now, but I don't have a bullet in my head. Forgiveness is one of the graces that we have as human beings. Can I be faulted for indulging in it?""

Emshwiller confirms the event but says she wanted to scare, not kill, him after he had said he wanted another girl. She adds it was not the only such incident provoked by her jealousy.

""One time before, I held him in the corner and I put a knife at his throat,"" she says.

""And he just said: 'Go ahead. Kill me.' And I couldn't do it. I just dropped the knife and walked out.""

Image caption Cartoonist Chad Essley is working on a graphic novel about McAfee which is due for release next year

Following the raid, McAfee and Emshwiller moved to his villa at San Pedro - a town on Belize's biggest island, Ambergris Caye - where they agreed to have an open relationship.

There they were visited by Chad Essley, a cartoonist, who began collaborating on a book about McAfee's life.

""I didn't quite realise that his lifestyle would be this older guy surrounded by young girls and bodyguards with guns,"" he says.

""Many of these girls were former prostitutes or had very rough lives.

""It was expressly forbidden to go out in the town and drink - the smell of alcohol, he could not be around it. He didn't want any of the girls doing any drugs at all.

""I interviewed each of these girls, got their background. They were incredibly sad. They were definitely in a better sort of situation being around John.""

Meanwhile next door, Gregory Faull, an Orlando sports bar owner who had recently divorced and decided to live in his Belize holiday home, was becoming increasingly irate at his neighbour's activities.

'Hatchet buried'

On Thursday, 8 November 2012, McAfee made the local headlines when he donated 40 stun guns, handcuffs and batons to the local police at a press conference.

Mayor Daniel Guerrero thanked him, stating: ""Crime is affecting the tourism industry as we have been listed on travel advisories; it is time to stop this. Let us protect our industry and turn San Pedro into the safe haven once more.""

That night the local TV bulletin declared that ""the hatchet was formally buried"", suggesting the rift between McAfee and Belize's authorities had ended.

Early on Sunday morning, Mr Faull was found dead in a pool of his blood by his housekeeper. Police called to the scene found a single 9mm shell nearby. They said a mobile phone and laptop were missing but there were no visible signs of a forced entry.

Image caption Gregory Faull was found shot dead at his home in Belize

The head of the police's Gang Suppression Unit told a local newspaper that his officers wanted to speak to McAfee as part of the investigation, but when they called at his house he did not appear to be in.

An article posted the following day by Wired magazine revealed why.

McAfee told the publication he had seen the officers approaching and had hidden in the sand of his property putting a cardboard box over his head.

He recalls that his caretaker had told him of Mr Faull's murder, and now he feared for his own life.

""The first thing that came to my mind was, 'Oh, my Lord. The government is finally trying to rid themselves of me,' he says.

""The government does from time to time.

""I had certainly been a huge thorn in their side, and they had simply got the wrong white man.

""Seriously, this is what went through my mind. My friends sort of calmed me down, and later said that's absurd. At the time I did not think so.""

McAfee acknowledges that he and Mr Faull had been at odds, but plays down the idea they hated each other or that he suspected him of being the person who had fed two of Emshwiller's dogs a poisoned tortilla.

""The entire five years I was there, I'd said maybe 15 words to him,"" he says.

""He did not like my dogs and the past two occasions I had seen him walking on the beach he complained. But so did everybody.

""There was no ongoing argument. Yeah, he was mad about my dogs. Maybe as I'm beginning to think now, maybe he was the one who poisoned them. At the time I certainly did not believe that.""

Image caption John McAfee dyed his hair black as part of one of his disguises

In fact, as ABC News later revealed, Mr Faull had filed a complaint to Mayor Guerrero about McAfee the previous month.

It said McAfee's dog had attacked a tourist; that his security guards had ""terrified"" other residents by walking around with shotguns and shining lights in their eyes, and that taxis and other traffic had been arriving at his property ""at all hours"", causing a disturbance.

""I did not find that out until weeks after I came back to the States,"" says McAfee when pressed about this.

""Belize is not like America where you file a complaint and then the police come out and chase things out. You file a complaint and it goes into a drawer.""

Hiding out

McAfee then went on the run, saying he feared he would be ""silenced"" if he was caught and thrown in jail.

It made headlines worldwide, in no small part due to the fact that he was posting updates to a blog and giving frequent interviews - actions he says were designed to ensure he couldn't be made to disappear if he had been caught.

Image caption Prime Minister Dean Barrow said it was ""utter and complete nonsense"" that the police wanted to kill McAfee

""I disguised myself as a ragged salesman,"" he recalls.

""All it takes is some dirty clothes and not bathing for a few days and not combing my hair.

""You know, people saw my photograph everywhere because all of the police and army had it for that month and a half I was underground. I just made sure I looked different than that.""

Questioned about the affair, Dean Barrow, Belize's prime minister, made it clear McAfee was not an official murder suspect, and had only been classed instead a ""person of interest"".

""I don't want to be unkind to the gentleman, but I believe he is extremely paranoid, even bonkers,"" the politician added.

Belize and corruption The BBC put Mr McAfee's claims of corruption to the Belize government, which is currently embroiled in a scandal involving the issue of a passport to a South Korean man who had never visited the country. It sent this reply: Belize has made great strides in improving transparency and ethical behaviour across all government departments. Where any sniff of corruption and evidence of such has been proven, the prime minister and the government have moved swiftly to stamp it out. This has most recently been demonstrated by the sacking of the junior minister of immigration. The US government and the Commonwealth have been instrumental in supporting Belize in addressing governance issues as we work to reduce even the appearance of fraud and corruption. Corruption is a cancer that Belize will continue to correct - it has no place in government or in any public office and we do not and will not tolerate it. The past is the past and this Belize government cannot change the behaviour of previous administrations or officials, but the prime minister has vowed to root out corruption wherever and whenever it occurs.

During this time McAfee continued to see Emshwiller.

""When he was on the run I went for lunches with him and then he would call and say: 'Come to this place, or go there,' she recalls.

""How to come, when to come. Not to go out, or stay home, or go to a different location. He would tell me that so nobody would get me.""

She adds that she regrets she did not go with him when he finally decided to escape the country.

The next major development came on 3 December when a reporter and photographer from Vice magazine revealed they were documenting McAfee's life on the run.

In what proved a frustrating twist for the tech guru, they then unwittingly revealed he had crossed the border to Guatemala - a fact revealed by a photo uploaded to the Vice website by staff at its headquarters, who failed to wipe its location data.

""I had gone out of my way to arrange the escape and I was breathing easily and looking forward to a few days of relaxation,"" remembers McAfee.

""We immediately had to go on the run again because we were in Guatemala illegally at this point. But it was no-one's real fault. It was just the fault of the moment.""

A few days later McAfee was arrested. There was initially speculation he would be sent back to Belize, but a week later he was allowed to fly to Miami a free man.

""After it was over I asked myself, 'Good Lord, I must have been afraid,'"" he says.

""But I really can't remember. I remember merely trying to solve the problems that occurred as they occurred.""

Hero and villain

McAfee has offered a $25,000 bounty for information relating to Mr Faull's death, but says an attempt to contact the victim's family proved unsuccessful.

The family has called the reward a ""hollow gesture"" and suggested if McAfee really wanted to help he would have met with the Belize police.

Image caption John McAfee continued to give interviews even when being held by the Guatemalan authorities

A spokesman for the country's government said its authorities still wanted to speak to the businessman.

""Mr McAfee's claims and his behaviour have been extreme,"" he told the BBC.

""The investigation is ongoing and McAfee remains a person of interest. If McAfee were to respond to questioning it would make a difference to the progress of the investigation - but this is currently out of the hands of the government of Belize.""

So long as the crime remains unsolved, it is inevitable the entrepreneur will always face suspicion. But he says he can live with that.

""There's always going to be someone who likes you and someone who dislikes you,"" he says.

""Someone who thinks you're a hero and some that think you're a villain. You know I just do what I can in situations like this to continue to state that I'm totally innocent.""

That doesn't mean he is trying to forget his time in Belize.

In addition to the graphic novel, he is working with a Canadian firm to make both a documentary and a movie about his time there.

He adds that George Jung - the imprisoned cocaine drugs lord portrayed by Johnny Depp in the film Blow - has been picked to write his biography.

While those projects brew, McAfee has returned to Silicon Valley, announcing the forthcoming launch of a $100 gadget that he promises can make you invisible on the net.

""If you cannot see it, you cannot hack it, you cannot look at it, you cannot spy on anything happening inside it,"" he explains.

He says the D-Central units will fit in people's pockets and allow their phones, tablets and PCs to communicate with other owners' devices within a three-block radius.

Image caption John McAfee is working with a Canadian company to make a documentary about his life

He adds they can also connect to the net anonymously via a node - a separate piece of equipment attached to the network - either directly or with their encrypted data relayed relayed via other D-Central boxes.

Each will frequently change their network identifier - a long number used by devices as an ID - making them hard to track, he explains.

He suggests it will appeal to college students who want to copy music anonymously and to businesses wanting to prevent the theft of corporate secrets.

He's also well aware that in the light of Edward Snowden's leaks about surveillance techniques used by the US and UK governments, part of the appeal will be thwarting their efforts.

""You know from their own paranoia and desire to stay in power, they are watching everything they can,"" he says.

Will the tech work? Will he really frustrate the authorities once again?

At this point, like so much of John McAfee's life, it's impossible to be sure of all the facts and it's ultimately up to you whether you take him at his word.","['addict', 'belize', 'mcafees', 'john', 'caption', 'mcafee', 'coder', 'im', 'came', 'going', 'later', 'head', 'runaway']","Who is the real John McAfee?

Sex addiction: 'Five times a day wasn't enough',Two sex addicts speak about the impact it has had on their lives.,[],None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Rebecca Barker said sex addiction took over her life and ruined her relationship

Sex addiction divides expert opinion, but for some people it is a very real condition that can be shameful and even ""life-destroying"". As relationship charity Relate calls for help to be made available on the NHS, two sufferers speak about the impact it has had on their lives.

""At its worst, even having sex five times a day wasn't enough.""

Mother-of-three Rebecca Barker said the compulsion took over her life in 2014 and ruined her relationship.

Her addiction meant she was constantly asking her partner for sex.

""It was literally the first thing I thought about when I woke up, I just couldn't get it off my mind,"" said the 37-year-old, originally from Tadcaster in North Yorkshire.

""I felt like everything reminded me of it. I think it was linked to my depression and the lack of serotonin. I felt like my whole body was craving it.

""It was giving me the instant hit and five minutes later I wanted it again.

""I became a hermit, I stayed at home because I felt ashamed that it was all I could think about. Even though no-one could read my mind, it still felt very uncomfortable for me to be around other people.""

Image copyright Rebecca Barker Image caption Ms Barker split with her partner and made lifestyle changes in a bid to control her addiction

Ms Barker's addiction caused serious problems in her relationship. Though her partner enjoyed the attention at first, it became insurmountable for the couple.

""At first he was fine with it but towards the end he couldn't understand it at all. After a few months he started to raise questions about why and where it was coming from.

""He accused me of having an affair - he thought I must have been feeling guilty about it and that's why I wanted sex with him.""

In November 2014, Ms Barker ""needed a break"" from the relationship and went to stay with her mother.

""When I left, I told my partner I needed to get better. He let me go, then the relationship broke down very quickly after that.

""I was under the care of a psychiatrist at the time - she kept saying she would alter my medication but she never said there were any support groups or anything.""

Ms Barker was diagnosed with depression in 2012 after the birth of her third child. She said after it intensified in 2014 she changed jobs, split up with her partner and moved to France.

""I made many lifestyle changes in order to get over the depression and the addiction and for me that has worked,"" she said.

What is sex addiction?

Image copyright Getty Images

Relate defines sexual addiction as any sexual activity that feels ""out of control"".

The Association for the Treatment of Sex Addiction and Compulsivity says its number of sex therapists has doubled in the past five years to 170

A questionnaire completed by 21,058 people since 2013 on the Sex Addiction Help website revealed 91% of those seeking help for sex addiction were male

The largest age group of 31% was aged 26-35, 1% were under 16 and 8% over 55

The World Health Organization is expected to approve the inclusion of ""compulsive sexual behaviour disorder"" in its International Classification of Diseases (ICD) list in May 2019

The NHS says experts disagree about whether it is possible to become addicted to sex and points to Relate for further help

Graham, whose name has been changed to protect his identity, said his compulsion led him to cheat on his wife with ""hundreds"" of sex workers, leaving him with ""rip-roaring guilt"".

""When you are in full-blown addiction you are obsessed with thinking about it - from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep.

""It was a horrible, gross experience - there is nothing sexy about it. When you wake up in the morning with a dose of chlamydia, it is not sexy.

""It is damaging and life-destroying.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Graham said when his wife found out he was relieved

Graham, who is in his 60s, estimates he paid hundreds of pounds a month for sex over several years, even building relationships with some of the sex workers he saw.

""What started with one affair at work led to another - but unlike most office affairs which may stem from one partner being unhappily married, mine was an addiction which I had to feed each day.

""You have one affair and then you want another and another one.

""I soon realised that the quickest and most convenient way for me to feed my addiction was to pay for it. I would be seeing escorts, sex workers, three or four times per week.

""It is just like being an alcoholic, it's a cycle that builds up in your mind - you feel a high from thinking about how it might happen and then you act it out in the way you planned.

""Then when it's over you feel remorseful, you say you're never going to do it again.""

Graham stopped leading his ""horrendous double life"" when his wife found an email and confronted him.

He sought help from Sex Addicts Anonymous (SAA), which has 78 self-help groups around the UK, and said he has abstained from extra-marital sex for several years.

""When I was found out, I remember feeling 'thank God - something might change'.

""I went to SAA which is an abstinence-based treatment. I call it going from shame to grace.

""It is such a relief to go to the meetings and find out there are other people who are just as miserable and sordid as you are.

""For people who are in this situation, I just want them to know that there is a way out and you can break the cycle.""

Peter Saddington, from Relate, said there is some therapy and group work available for sex addicts, but most of it is private.

""[Addicts] realise it is causing harm, but they can't stop and they recognise they need help in changing it.

""For alcoholics, there is Alcoholics Anonymous, but they can also go to the NHS [which] provides support for people who have alcohol or drug problems.

""It would be appropriate that [sex addicts] can go to their GP and get support because it has a crippling effect both on them, on relationships, on their families, their financial situation and their mental health.""

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""People who think they may have a sex addiction can seek advice and help via NHS Choices, which includes contacts at Relate, Sexaholics Anonymous, SAA and ATSAC.""

Children of alcoholics 'damaged',,[],9/3/2006 23:57,"Children of alcoholics are more likely to become addicted

The Priory study said children of alcoholics were four times more likely to be addicted to drink and there was a risk of drug and gambling problems.

The private health provider said a child's early life was characterised by chaos, trauma, confusion and shame and, quite often, sexual and physical abuse.

The report found 55% of domestic violence occurs in alcoholic homes.

The children of alcoholics can break the cycle

Professor Martin Plant, addictions expert

The Priory reviewed existing data on crime, abuse and alcoholism as well as consulting its own doctors and therapists to compile the report.

It said the problems children of alcoholics experience in early life had a profound impact later in life.

The report said growing up in an alcoholic household was inextricably linked to abuse.

Some 55% of family violence occurs in alcoholic homes with alcohol a factor in 90% of child abuse cases.

Studies have also showed a third of daughters of alcoholics experienced physical abuse and a fifth sexual abuse - up to four times higher than in non-alcoholic homes, the Priory said.

The report said children reacted in one of three ways - either they became withdrawn, went into denial or used the experience to benefit themselves by becoming stronger.

Many of the children of alcoholics, even those who would perhaps have been withdrawn, could grow up to be likeable, kind and intuitive.

Difficulties

But the problems surfaced when they had to confront difficulties.

The report said: ""Their feelings about themselves are the opposite of the serene image they present - they generally feel insecure, inadequate, dull, unsuccessful, vulnerable and anxious"".

They also struggled to develop strong personal relationships.

Researchers said previous studies had revealed that 70% of children of alcoholics develop compulsive behaviour around either alcohol, drugs, food, sex, work or gambling, while a half ended up marrying alcoholics.

And they said children of alcoholics were four times more likely to become alcoholics - partly because of genetics - than the one in 20 of the general population that have the condition currently.

Priory addictions expert Dr Michael Bristow said: ""There is a widespread misconception that addiction is all about the addict, that it is solely the addict who suffer from his illness.

""The reality? Alcoholism affects the adult alcoholic's entire family, particularly the children.""

Professor Martin Plant, an addiction expert at the University of the West of England, said: ""These findings are not altogether surprising. But what I would like to stress, is that it is not inevitable.

""The children of alcoholics can break the cycle, many end up loathing alcohol and refusing to let it destroy their lives like it may have done to their parents.""","['priory', 'alcohol', 'damaged', 'abuse', 'withdrawn', 'alcoholics', 'report', 'likely', 'times', 'alcoholic', 'children']","Children of alcoholics are more likely to become addictedThe Priory study said children of alcoholics were four times more likely to be addicted to drink and there was a risk of drug and gambling problems.

Amsterdam alcoholics paid in beer for collecting litter,A group of alcoholics is being paid in beer to clean the streets of Amsterdam. Anna Holligan joined the alcoholics on litter collection duties.,"['Anna Holligan', 'Bbc News']",None,"Image caption Collecting litter on Amsterdam's streets is a way to raise money legally

Alcoholics are being paid in beer to clean the streets of Amsterdam as part of a project partly funded by the Dutch government - the organisers think other countries should abandon ""old-fashioned political correctness"" and adopt the same approach.

Rene scours the streets, grasping at discarded wrappers.

His movements are fuelled by a tangible pride. It is an unfamiliar emotion for a man whose alcohol addiction has cost him so much.

""I have four children and three ex-wives, but alcohol has finished everything. I don't see them, they don't know where I am, or if I am alive. Now I have only him. He is there for 30 years, when times are good and bad, he is always there,"" he says, referring to his habit.

His affectionate gaze travels downwards. It rests on an aluminium can.

Chronic alcoholics have congregated inside a communal space, commandeered by the Rainbow Group. It is a private but primarily government-funded company, which helps those struggling to cope due to homelessness, drug abuse or alcoholism.

A gas heater emanates warmth; someone hums along to the theme tune from Armageddon.

Rene, 52, has just cracked open his third can of the day. It has just gone 11:30 in the morning.

Image caption Rene has four children and three ex-wives but now he is devoted to alcohol

He is one of 20 alcoholics who have joined this initiative. They arrive at 09:00 and work until 15:00. They take extended breaks for beer, cigarettes and a hot lunch, all provided free of charge.

The distinctive aroma of stamppot, a traditional Dutch vegetable stew, wafts through from the kitchen.

The air is hazy with smoke and camaraderie; another pop anthem fills the room with nostalgia.

""They like to cook and you see qualities they didn't even know they had,"" says Janet van de Noord, who runs the Rainbow Group's litter project.

'Cost-effective'

""It's quite difficult to get these people off the alcohol completely. We have tried everything else. Now this is the only thing that works. We might not make them better, but we are giving them a better quality of life and it's better for the neighbourhood, they're giving something back to society.""

Inside an oversized garden shed, decorated with Ajax football paraphernalia, about 6,000 cans of beer are stacked in crates.

The Rainbow Group is reluctant to say exactly how much the Dutch government pays towards the free beer, cautious of generating any negative publicity that might jeopardise their funding.

But Ms van de Noord argues it is a cost-effective way to tackle the impact of alcoholism. ""If people are being arrested, it also costs society a lot of money. So this can only be a good thing. I don't see why other countries wouldn't want to do it.""

When I asked other Dutch people about the project they all spoke in favour of it.

Ten minutes' walk from the now litter-free streets lies Amsterdam's Oosterpark.

Image caption Oosterpark is no longer strewn with litter but some alcoholics have not been persuaded to give up their park benches

Fountains propel shimmering bursts of water; leaves create an autumnal collage on the path.

This slice of Dutch life is interrupted by a man staggering towards us. ""Mooooi!"" (""beautiful"") he says, greeting us with a sleazy smile. But he quickly makes it clear that he and his friends do not wish to be interviewed.

He is one of the remaining alcoholics who have not been persuaded to abandon their park benches.

Since the street-cleaning programme started 12 months ago, local police have received fewer reports of stabbings and muggings in the park. And all of the residents we spoke to said they were happy with the government supporting this unconventional approach.

Instead of being ostracised by society, the alcoholics' needs appear to have been incorporated into the Dutch healthcare system.

The Rainbow Group is optimistic their success so far will attract more funding and help them to reach the unreachable. Other cities in the Netherlands are now considering introducing similar schemes.

Floor van Bakkum of Amsterdam's Jellinek anti-addiction clinic says the project is a good way to deal with ""a very problematic group - it's kind of harm reduction"". She likened it to giving carefully monitored methadone or heroin doses to chronic heroin addicts.

""It might help them to do something else with their life. You always have to monitor such a project, so it shouldn't attract new alcoholics - it's not an open invitation to drink in Oosterpark."" She said such a scheme would be inappropriate for alcoholics who still live at home and have a job.

'Unchangeable reality'

Back on litter duty, Rene tells me about his past life - expensive cars, extensive travel and some details best not shared. But, he insists, he is happier now, with nothing.

He detects our incredulity: ""You don't believe me? Trust me, if I could have my life again I would give it all up for this.

""I know he will never expect anything from me or let me down. Now I am free,"" he says, referring to the drink habit.

Some might wonder, how free can an addict be?

But the founders of this project treat this addiction as an ""unchangeable reality"" and tackle it using the only device that is guaranteed to connect with the patients.

""I come for the beer. If there was no beer then why would I come?"" says Rene.

Regardless of their motivations, Rene and his friends are making a positive difference in a community where they were once despised.

""It's true,"" Rene concedes, acknowledging the irony. ""They used to treat us like garbage - and now we are picking up their garbage, we are not the garbage anymore.""","['amsterdam', 'streets', 'project', 'group', 'collecting', 'alcoholics', 'beer', 'dutch', 'litter', 'rainbow', 'rene', 'life', 'paid']","Chronic alcoholics have congregated inside a communal space, commandeered by the Rainbow Group.

Thousands of dangerous drink-drivers are reoffenders,"Almost one in five motorists listed on an official register of the most dangerous drink-drivers has been on it before, the BBC learns through a Freedom of Information request.","['Nicola Beckford', 'Bbc Radio', 'The World At One']",None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Anish Patel, whose wife was killed by a drink driver: ""Something has to be done""

As new figures show the number of people killed in drink-driving crashes rose by 17%, the BBC has discovered that thousands of drink-drivers are repeat offenders.

A fifth of those on a DVLA ""high-risk register"" have been on it before.

There are calls for more stringent checks before offenders are given back their licences.

The government said it had tightened up rules, and drivers now had to prove they were no longer alcohol-dependent.

Drink-drivers who are more than two and a half times over the legal limit, who have two or more drink-drive offences within a 10-year period or who refuse to give breath, blood or urine samples, are classed by the DVLA as ""high-risk offenders"".

Using the Freedom of Information Act, the BBC discovered there are currently 230,149 banned drivers on the DVLA's scheme and of these, 42,207 drivers had been on it before.

Their licences had been returned because they were considered safe to drive when their initial ban expired.

But under rules introduced in June, when a ban expires, offenders can reapply for their licence only when they have passed a medical test to prove they are no longer alcohol-dependent.

However, this will apply only to new offenders - those convicted earlier can drive after reapplying for their driving licence.

Provisional figures released on Thursday show that 280 people were killed in drink-drive accidents in 2012, an increase of about 17% compared with 2011. This accounts for 16% of all road deaths in Britain. Overall, deaths were down 8% on 2011, at 1,754.

Police and road safety campaigners say the system of dealing with drink-drivers needs to be re-examined.

'Bitter experience'

Insp Richard Auty, who has investigated collisions for the Metropolitan Police for 17 years, said he was surprised by the DVLA figure, adding that it was ""quite large"".

He expressed doubts that the new testing system would address the problem.

""I suspect from the people that I've dealt with that whilst it will deal with the worst offenders, the binge drinkers that are able to control it will clearly not turn up to a medical drunk, so it won't effectively deal with those people. So I would suggest a mandatory driving test or extended driving test before you get your licence back would be a much greater deterrent.""

In 2009, Anish Patel's wife, Catriona, 39, was killed by a serial offender while cycling to work. She was crushed under the wheels of his lorry outside Oval tube station in south London.

Image caption The driver of this lorry who killed Catriona Patel had been on a drinking binge the night before. He was jailed for seven years.

The driver had three previous drink-driving convictions, had been disqualified 20 times and had three previous convictions for reckless driving.

Mr Patel said: ""It was just a normal day and a few phone calls later and hours later your whole life gets turned upside down and changed forever. She was my best friend, she was the love of my life, she was my soulmate, we did absolutely everything together.""

He felt angry and bitter when he learned about the driver's previous convictions.

""I just thought the biggest thing that shouldn't have happened that day was him being on the road and driving a 40-tonne tipper truck fully laden through one of the busiest junctions through central London.

""These people obviously are not operating by the same rules of the vast majority of the population operate by and I think that there has to be something done about serial offenders. It is too common an occurrence that people get convicted of drink-driving and they are back on the road either illegal or unfortunately legally. ""

'Get carried away'

Johnny, a former serial drink-driver who stopped drinking through Alcoholics Anonymous, was caught three times in nine weeks.

He was banned for two years and continued to drink-drive for 15 years but was never caught again.

He said: ""I always thought of the consequences but unfortunately just the following morning. I was just going out for one or two drinks, get a bit carried away and invariably I'd end up drink-driving.

""I'm not convinced that a tougher sentence would have made any difference. How much tougher do you want it to be? You're going to lose your liberty, you're going to lose your job, you're going to lose your home. You're going to lose everything basically if you do it again. That never stopped me from driving.""

Amy Aeron-Thomas, executive director of RoadPeace, the national charity for road crash victims, said it was time to review driving bans and increase the number of breathalyser tests.

""There is public support for a five-year ban for first-time offenders. Now you are talking about repeat offenders, big-risk offenders - they deserve lengthy driving bans if not losing their licence permanently.

""We know with the decrease in road policing there are fewer breathalyser tests being given so there is a greater chance of them getting away with it.""

Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: ""Drink-drivers are a menace and it is right that we do everything we can to keep the most high-risk offenders off the road.

""That is why we have tightened up the rules which mean that they now have to take medical tests to prove they are no longer alcohol-dependent before being allowed to drive.""

You can hear more on this report on BBC Radio 4's World at One at 13:00, or listen to it online here.","['drinkdrivers', 'killed', 'drivers', 'lose', 'road', 'driving', 'rules', 'times', 'thousands', 'offenders', 'going', 'youre', 'reoffenders', 'dangerous']","The government said it had tightened up rules, and drivers now had to prove they were no longer alcohol-dependent.
Police and road safety campaigners say the system of dealing with drink-drivers needs to be re-examined.
You're going to lose your liberty, you're going to lose your job, you're going to lose your home.
You're going to lose everything basically if you do it again.
Now you are talking about repeat offenders, big-risk offenders - they deserve lengthy driving bans if not losing their licence permanently.",https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-24281043,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/70154000/jpg/_70154783_70154782.jpg
9/11: The 73 minutes that changed my life,"Like thousands of others, Artie Van Why saw the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York from the streets below. What he witnessed in those minutes has changed his life in a profound way and will, he believes, continue to affect him until the day he dies.","['Tom Geoghegan', 'Bbc News', 'Washington Dc']",None,"Like thousands of other New Yorkers, Artie Van Why saw the attacks on the World Trade Center from the streets below. What he witnessed in those minutes changed his life profoundly and will, he believes, continue to haunt him until the day he dies.

The moment he walked through the revolving doors of his office building and stepped on to the street on that sunny September morning, Artie Van Why's world shifted a few degrees on its axis.

It was like the Wizard of Oz, stepping into another world

His life from that instant took a different course, propelled by the mayhem that enveloped him that day, events the world later identified by two numbers, nine and 11.

Millions of people watched on television as four hijacked planes crashed in the US, two of them into one famous New York landmark. But Van Why was in the thick of it.

The experience forced him to leave New York, his home for 26 years, and move more than 100 miles west to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, deep in Amish country.

Ten years after the atrocities, sitting in the corner of a humble one-bedroom apartment located above a funeral home, his face is a picture of concentration as he recalls the day's events.

""I remember it was a beautiful day. Whenever I see a really beautiful blue sky, it takes me back to that morning.""

He was working as a clerical assistant at law firm Holland & Knight, and his office was on the 23rd floor of a building separated from the World Trade Center site only by Church Street and the Millennium Hilton hotel. At 08:46, a loud boom shook the building.

A colleague asked if it was thunder, then someone screamed for everyone to get out of the building, because a plane had hit one of the twin towers. Expecting to see a small aircraft sticking out of the famous skyscraper, Van Why took the lift to the ground floor and exited through a revolving door.

""It was like the Wizard of Oz, stepping into another world. It seemed as everything slowed down and it was going frame by frame as if in slow motion.

""All these white paper sheets were covering the ground like snow and coming down. I remember thinking that I'd never seen so much paper.

""I walked a short distance to Church Street where the towers were and that's when I saw the North Tower for the first time. I was dumbstruck. It was hard to comprehend what I was seeing.

""There was a huge black hole, the flames were bright orange and the smoke was billowing out of the tower.""

More people were arriving on the streets, he says, and sirens could be heard in the background. As his recollections become more vivid, the 58-year-old closes his eyes and rocks back and forth in his orange armchair, his right foot tapping the carpet vigorously.

His rented apartment is full of reminders of what he went through. A photo of the World Trade Center is on the fridge, and other photographs featuring the famous Manhattan skyline adorn the living room, like pictures of a deceased member of the family.

Image caption Reminders of the life left behind fill his apartment

One wall is full of framed newspaper cuttings, reviews of the play that Van Why - a former actor - wrote and performed about 9/11. And in front of this shrine, he sits and recalls the minutes that reshaped his life, wild hand gestures making the scene all the more real.

""I don't know how long I was looking at the North Tower, trying to take it all in. I was transfixed. What broke it was when I realised there were other things falling, there were people falling and everyone realised at the same time.

""People started screaming and my reaction was to scream 'No, No, No!' at the thought that people were falling down. And that's when - I don't know why I reacted in this way - but my instinct was to run towards them.

I remember shouting out 'God, save us all!

""I ran to the plaza where they were falling. I didn't have a moment's thought, I just ran towards the tower, thinking 'Can I help these people?' I imagined them laying there and the thought of being able to hold their hand or sit and be with them, comfort them.""

Another man was running with him, and for a moment, the two stopped and stood side by side, taking in the enormity of what they were seeing - human beings jumping to their deaths. Van Why recalls seeing bodies piling up on the ground.

""One of my most vivid memories is looking to my left and I saw this man in a suit falling. Somehow I had thought that if you ever jumped from a high place, you would be dead before you hit the ground.

""But I remember seeing how very much alive he was and I can still see his arms and legs moving as if to brace himself. Fortunately I didn't see him hit.""

Some guards shouted for the two men to come to safety through another World Trade Center Building, number 5. They went down a lift and out of the site on to Church Street, from where Van Why saw the second plane hit the South Tower, only 17 minutes after the first.

Pandemonium broke out. Debris was raining down, he says, as he ran towards Fulton Street, at one point falling to the ground.

""People started to run over the top of me and I thought I was going to be trampled to death but I managed to get up. I remember shouting out 'God, save us all!'""

He recalls an African-American woman tripping and being helped to her feet by a businessman. Then he ran past a large man who was lying face down in the street.

Getting down on his knees, Van Why saw that the man had a serious head injury. He appeared to have been hit by a putty knife that had fallen from one of the buildings and was lying nearby stained with blood.

""Another man stopped and gave me a denim jacket which we put over the open wound and then I remember seeing his watch on the street beside him and I put it in his pants [trouser] pocket. We turned him over and he had a work tag with a name.""

With tears falling and his voice cracking, Van Why goes on: ""My biggest regret is that I didn't look to his tag to see what the name was. I could have found his family and told them that there were people with him.""

An ambulance arrived and it required several people to lift the man on to the stretcher. Van Why stroked his arm and told him he would be fine.

Realising he had left his mobile phone in the office, he began asking strangers if he could borrow one to get the message through to his parents that he was OK. But none of the phones were working, so he went into a cafe and used a telephone there.

When he emerged, he heard a deafening sound. He looked to his left and saw a wall of grey smoke coming towards him. The South Tower was collapsing.

For the second time that morning, he started running. The time was 09:59, 73 minutes after the first plane flew into the North Tower.

By the time he got to his apartment on 43rd Street, after deliberately avoiding the area around the Empire State Building, it was approaching noon. The North Tower had also collapsed, but Van Why had been far enough away to not hear it.

In the days that followed, he slept only fitfully and always with the bedroom light on.

""I was afraid of the dark. It never happened before 9/11. It was a sense of security having that light on.

""For that first week I would wake up early and call my parents first thing. I would be on the phone crying with them. There was a lot of crying that week.

""I was feeling sadness and grief and mourning like I had never felt, similar to losing a loved one. And still an incomprehension, trying to understand what had happened.""

He avoided watching television or reading newspapers because he could not bear to see replays or photos of the planes striking the towers. He had his own images, pictures inside his head, sometimes appearing with a clarity that transported him back to the mayhem.

He discovered that two men who lived in his apartment building were missing and a lawyer at work who was last seen running towards the towers was also presumed dead.

Van Why had done exactly the same and survived. As a recovering alcoholic who had been sober for two years, he already had a therapist, and in the weeks following 9/11 he saw him daily.

Alcoholics Anonymous meetings were also an opportunity to share his feelings with others, but he lived alone and had no partner to provide constant support. Before long he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

Holland & Knight opened makeshift offices at a hotel in Midtown but he did not feel able to go back to work until two or three weeks after the attacks. When he did, it was the first time he had ventured outside his neighbourhood.

A few days later, he rented a car and drove to Maryland, for a 30-year high school reunion. The sight of an aeroplane coming into land caused him to burst into tears. At the event, when he introduced himself by saying: ""I'm from the greatest city in the world, New York City,"" people stood up and applauded.

His old offices near Ground Zero were soon ready again, but Van Why found returning to the scene too harrowing to endure. The smell of smoke from the still-smouldering site would fill his nostrils as he emerged from the subway.

The WTC plaza - once his lunchtime sanctuary - now resembled to him a grave. One morning, the police allowed him to enter the site so he could lay six roses on what he regarded as ""hallowed ground"".

In November 2001, he resigned from work after 13 years of service. It was too painful to continue. He instead focused on his new project - writing his own story about his experience.

I was out of the country and didn't get back to New York City until the end of October. I was in touch with Artie, aware of his proximity, but didn't fully understand the impact on him until I got home. It was unravelling. It could only be unravelling. No-one should have to witness something like that. In survival mode, he knew he no longer could stay in NYC. His family, which had always been a strong connection in his life, would provide a sense of comfort and familiarity he desperately needed. He moved out of the city and regrouped. It took time. Through his grief and pain he also found a creative outlet. He was able to process his grief by writing about it.

He had written emails to family and friends following the attacks, to explain what happened, and they forwarded his story to other people. Soon he began to receive appreciative emails from strangers.

Encouraged, he began to develop his story into a script, convinced it was his mission to keep the memory alive. It became a one-man play that he performed off-Broadway and in Los Angeles.

""The play gave me a sense of purpose. Those two years after 9/11, when I was really focused on my play, that is the only time in my life I felt fulfilled, because I had a purpose and I thought I was doing something important and something selfless, because I was doing it for the memory of the people I saw die.""

After each performance, some people would tell him their own story of where they were, making him realise, he says, that people across the US had a story of 9/11.

He was hoping he could continue performing the show for at least five years.

""I wanted to dedicate my life to it. But it closed in New York earlier than planned, the major papers ignored it and some reviews were critical, saying I was trying to profit out of it.""

It seemed to him like the city was ready to move on and he was not. The spirit that defined New York in the days, weeks and months afterwards had gone, he says, and he felt a bit like a ""lone crusader"".

Image caption Van Why performed his play in 2003

""It still weighed so heavily on my emotions and who I was, so to see other people weren't doing that and moving on, it was like 'How can they be doing that?'

""There was anger and a feeling of isolation. In the month after 9/11, it was all you talked about with strangers, but two years afterwards, there was a sense that 'OK, you don't need to talk about this any more.'""

Immersing himself for years in writing and performing the play probably held him back, he admits, because he was dwelling on the events and re-living them, but not dealing with the emotions.

That process did not begin until he moved. In September 2003, he started a new life in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, because he wanted to be near his parents.

""I never thought I would leave New York, I envisaged my last days would be in New York but it just seemed like the right thing to do.""

He felt guilty about leaving, but the pull of family was overwhelming and he felt like he had nowhere else to go.

""All of a sudden I just needed to be closer to them, I wanted it and needed it. For me and my parents, the reality that 9/11 was a day that I could have died brought the importance of being with my family to me.

""Though I was in my 50s, there was a sense that I needed mummy and daddy, that sense of security and that sense of home.""

Growing up, home was Gaithersburg in Maryland, where the young Van Why was a quiet boy, according to his parents.

Thelma and Art Van Why His parents endured a terrifying few hours on 11 Sept 2001 while they waited for news

Relief at hearing he was OK turned to despair as they watched their son spiral into depression

But in 2003, he moved to be near to them both

""We're so happy that he's moved because we became closer. It's a big change,"" says Thelma. ""But to see your own child go through that, you wonder what you can do to help.""

""He was in his own little shell, his own little world and we would try to comfort him as much as we could,"" says Art. ""We just told him we were here for him. So it's really helped me to know he's starting to come round.""

He says he felt different from other children - he later realised he was gay - and was bullied.

After high school, he attended a small, conservative Christian college, where he majored first in Bible studies, then in drama.

He moved to New York in 1977 with the dream of becoming an actor but after struggling for 10 years to get sustained work in the theatre, he gave it up. The clerical work that had been a supplement to his income became his main and only job.

As a young man, he'd had a difficult relationship with his parents and throughout his adult life he had seen them only three or four times a year. It was not until he moved to Pennsylvania, two years after the attacks, that his relationship with them, in his own words, ""fully healed"".

""I didn't know what it would entail, moving here, but eight years later, my relationship with my parents is incredible. It has a depth and appreciation it has never had before.""

When he arrived in 2003, he didn't have a job, an apartment or a car, and he left many long-standing friendships behind in New York. And there was no-one who could relate to what he had been through.

After the bright lights of Manhattan, the small city of Lancaster - with fewer than 60,000 residents and a homespun, rural charm - struck a tranquil note.

Van Why withdrew socially, spending a lot of time in what he calls his ""cave"", a room where he would just watch television endlessly at weekends. Even when he was coaxed out of his isolation by colleagues for a coffee, he was lost and distracted.

A low period at the end of last year, when he was often breaking down, was his grief finally being released, he believes.

""I was very fortunate I did not lose my physical life but I lost my life as I knew it. The person I was on September 10th, that person is no longer. I had to go through a very emotional period which enabled me to go and face Ground Zero.""

In the last few months he has started to come out of his metaphorical cave. The first step on the road to recovery was going back to New York in April, for the first time since he left in 2003. With his parents and sister Sue by his side, he visited the place that had haunted him for nearly a decade.

""That was a huge step for me. It was very emotional but it helped to put an end to that chapter of my life. Even though I had been away for eight years, there was guilt that I had left my city when it was still healing.""

Only having closed that door, could he start to regard Lancaster as home, he says. Shortly after that trip, he met someone and began a relationship.

""Being with him, I realised that I had forgotten what it was like to be happy. It's like I am stepping back into life. I'm finally moving past mourning.""

But there are other struggles. He has two jobs, one in the box office of the Fulton Theatre in Lancaster, and another as a cashier in a Weis supermarket. The two incomes combined earn him about $20,000 (£12,196) a year, about $50,000 (£30,494) less than he was earning in New York.

'I witnessed the goodness of man' ""I don't believe I had witnessed the wrath of anyone's God that morning. What I had been a witness to when I looked up at those burning towers was the ultimate evil that man is capable of. The evidence of just how deep hatred could run, how far it could go. But I had also been a witness to something else that day - down on the ground. I witnessed the ultimate goodness of man, the evidence of how strong courage could be, to what lengths it would go. I believe God was in the hands of everyone who reached out to someone else. He was in the arms of people on the streets as they embraced one another. He was in the tears of strangers who cried together. He was in all the lives that were given in the line of duty, in the acts of heroism. He was in the hearts of the people across the country who, as they watched the horror from afar, felt compassion."" That Day In September

It's a thorn in his side, he says. ""I have debts and try to pay them off when I can and meet my basic expenses. So far, I've been lucky to just get by.""

If he had been told in 2001 that in 10 years he would be living in Pennsylvania and working in a theatre and a supermarket, he would have been shocked.

""I liked my job. I liked working down there. And, yes, I was making a good salary. I would like to think I might have developed a relationship with someone.

""At the time of 9/11, I was in the best place I had been for a long time - sober and happy. Perhaps I would have been able to take vacations and travel, things I'm unable to do now.""

And the images are still there every day, sometimes popping into his head without warning, with such force that he zones out while his mind revisits the carnage.

""They are like snippets of a movie. I will replay watching this one man who I saw falling, watching him. I will flash to the injured man I saw laying in the streets. It's a series of vignettes that my mind just goes back to.""

A siren is enough to take him back there and it's a sound that makes his body tighten. He still has not boarded a plane, although tall buildings don't instil in him the same fear they once did.

A study by Cornell University suggests that the trauma suffered by witnesses like Van Why may have physically altered their brains, damaging their ability to process emotions.

He says 9/11 survivors and witnesses like himself are the ""forgotten majority"", never considered among the victims.

What I was doing for a long time was letting 9/11 define who I was

""They're not letting any survivors to the [10th anniversary] ceremony in New York, it's just bereaved family members.

""There's a sense that you don't count. Some people are still struggling terribly, far worse than I am. Everyone who was there is still affected to a degree, but people don't remember us.

""We're not suffering physically and weren't injured that day and didn't lose a family member. It's like we don't count.""

Despite the financial and mental strains, he is now looking to the future with a new optimism.

""It's my life now and I've never accepted that before. That's another change in the past months. Not that I was fighting it before, but there's an acceptance, I'm moving out of the mourning stage and back to life again.""

It's comparable to losing a partner, he says, with the memory of that loved one never disappearing but gradually losing its hold.

""I can't imagine a day going by when I don't think about it, even as a passing thought.

""What I was doing for a long time was letting 9/11 define who I was and I think I'm getting away from that now. My experience of 9/11 is part of who I am but not all of me.""

FA Cup: Ex-Everton midfielder George Green on self-destruction and depression,"He was once compared to Wayne Rooney before a cocaine addiction saw George Green go from a £110,000-a-year midfielder to £80-a-game at Ossett Albion.",[],9/22/2018 19:48,"Everton's George Green, then aged 17, tackles Liverpool's Seyi Ojo in an Under-18 game in November 2013

It is October 2011 and 15-year-old George Green is travelling to London for a trial with Tottenham Hotspur when a phone call changes everything. Everton have agreed a £2m deal with Bradford City for the schoolboy midfielder.

Green signs a two-and-a-half-year contract, receives a £45,000 signing-on fee in three instalments of £15,000, and a promising future with the Toffees beckons for the Dewsbury teenager.

Four years later he is standing on railway tracks near his hometown waiting for the next train so that he can end his life, Green's hopes of making it as a Premier League player ruined by cocaine and alcohol.

""I was in that much debt, I thought I'd lost my partner because of my drug use, and I didn't see a way back for me with football,"" the 22-year-old told BBC Sport.

Now at sixth-tier Chester, who beat City of Liverpool 4-0 in the FA Cup second qualifying round on Saturday, Green opens up about having too much too soon, self-destruction, depression and how he is attempting to rebuild his life.

""Mental health and addiction is an everyday battle. I'm giving it my best shot,"" he says. ""If others can learn from it, I'd rather help.""

'A £2,000-a-month cocaine addiction'

It was Everton Under-21s boss David Unsworth who broke the news to a tearful Green, then aged 19, he was no longer required after a loan at League Two Tranmere Rovers in 2015.

He had arrived at Goodison Park a fresh-faced schoolboy and was quickly compared to Wayne Rooney, who made his senior debut for the club aged 16.

Green left without playing a first-team game having spent five weeks of his four years at Goodison Park in London's Priory hospital, which provides a range of mental health and addictions treatments.

""Everton paid for it all, I think it was about £5,000-a-week,"" said Green, who was playing in the Toffees' U21 side by the age of 16 alongside future England internationals John Stones and Ross Barkley.

""Before I turned 18 you wouldn't catch me out at night. As soon as I was 18 it was like a new world opened up. I was drinking, doing drugs and playing football.

""The first time I took drugs I'd gone to watch football in a pub with mates. I was offered cocaine and it changed my life.""

At first Green was able to hide his habit from the likes of Kevin Sheedy, his youth-team coach, but before long he was taking 30 grams a month and life was spiralling out of control.

""I was spending way over £2,000 a month. I remember one particular Monday morning I was supposed to be training. I didn't wake up until the afternoon.

""The night before I'd gone to a friend's house for drink and drugs. I think that's when alarm bells started ringing at Everton.

""I remember phoning a welfare officer at Everton one night. I was crying and said 'I need help'. Soon after I was admitted to the Priory.""

Drugs and alcohol took a toll on Green. Here he is aged 19 signing for non-league Ossett Albion five months after being released by Everton

'I've earned £500,000 - I've got an iPad to show for it'

Having joined Everton as a £150-a-week schoolboy, Green's earnings reached £110,000-a-year at the Premier League club.

Since leaving three years ago, he has also had spells with Burnley and Oldham Athletic - as well as Viking in Norway's top flight under Englishman Ian Burchnall, now boss at Swedish side Ostersunds.

Green, who has also featured in the Scottish Premiership for Kilmarnock, believes he has earned at least £500,000 playing football.

""I have an iPad to show for it. That's how much of a downfall my life has become because of drugs,"" he added.

""I squandered it all. I'm embarrassed.""

At Everton, the former England youth international did most of his socialising back home in Yorkshire.

""A good night out? I'd easily spend about £1,500. A meal would cost between £200 and £300,"" he said.

""I'd be like 'let's get a bottle of champagne' and then a girl would come and sit next to me and I'd be like 'would you like a bottle of champagne?'

""Earning the money I was, I thought it was never going to end.

""Everybody wanted to know who I was and I was enjoying life. But I never got introduced to people who would keep me on the straight and narrow. They drank or did drugs and I fell into that circle.

""I got a brand new Mercedes-Benz A-Class and did about £4,000 damage to it. That stemmed from drink-driving. I was ridiculous, I used to drink-drive everywhere.""

Before he turned 18 and problems with drink and drugs, Green (centre) was compared to Wayne Rooney

'It wasn't my time to go'

Green had four clubs within 14 months of leaving Everton. Soon after his release from the Toffees, he joined League One Oldham on a two-year deal. He lasted five months before his contract was cancelled by mutual consent in November 2015.

""It was due to drink and drugs, I'd fallen out of love with the game and decided I didn't want to play any more.""

By now, Green was on a downward spiral. He had a drink-driving conviction and, after blowing much of his earnings on alcohol and cocaine, he was struggling financially. In addition, he was suffering from depression.

He did not stay away from football for long.

A week after leaving Oldham, Green had signed for non-league Yorkshire side Ossett Albion for £80-a-game. He had gone from Everton to the eighth tier of English football in less than six months.

It was around this time he first contemplated suicide.

""Leaving Everton hit me hard,"" he said. ""I was stood on a railway track close to Mirfield station near Dewsbury ready for a train to come. I remember it being around eight or nine o'clock at night.

""I hadn't written a note. It was all the pressures of everything in my life. The drugs, the alcohol, my mental health, football wasn't going well, lack of money.

""Then there was an announcement over the speakers that the next train was delayed.

""I thought 'it must be a sign that it can't be my time to go'. I broke down in tears and walked away.""

Green's mental health problems continued. He took an overdose after joining Salford City on loan from Burnley in early 2017.

""I went in the pill cupboard at home and took everything there was. I wanted to die at that time,"" he added.

Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville, Salford's co-owner, offered his support.

Green said: ""I was invited round to his house. I had been in hospital for taking too many tablets. We spoke for an hour about football and things Salford could do to help me.""

Five months clean and a baby on the way

He lives near Dewsbury with his two-year-old daughter Daisy and fiancee, Charli, while the couple are due to welcome a baby boy to the family in October.

Gone are the flash cars and the hangers-on who formed part of his life when he was at Everton.

Instead of a Mercedes-Benz A-Class, Green now drives a Kia Rio to and from Chester, the club he joined in July from National League North rivals Nuneaton.

Money is tight but the player blames no-one but himself.

He relapsed in April but says he has not touched drink or drugs since, and attends weekly Alcoholics Anonymous and Cocaine Anonymous meetings.

Green's support network includes former Aston Villa and England defender Gary Charles, a recovering alcoholic who now has a business which provides care to people who are experiencing a wide range of problems, including depression and alcohol/drug dependency.

""There's not a day I don't speak to him. He's a lifesaver,"" adds Green.

'Without football, I'd be dead'

At the time of this interview, Green has an additional battle in his life. Two months after signing, he has yet to make his Chester debut because of a back injury which is likely to require surgery. He's frustrated and impatient.

He has kept himself busy by getting to know Chester fans at home games, signing autographs and posing for pictures.

Chester, a fan-owned club with a community trust, run a weekly mental health and wellbeing session which offers vulnerable members of society a chance to get out and play football.

Green hopes opening up about his problems will raise awareness of mental health and addiction issues.

""Football is the only thing I am good at. Without it I'd be dead,"" he added.

""I thought my career would be over if I came out and started talking about my issues with drugs.

""Then I said to myself 'how about being honest for once in your life and admit your problems'.

Blandford crash death girl's mum 'hid alcoholism',"Agencies were alerted to Alanda Pike's drinking before the fatal crash but ""key links"" were missed.",[],None,"Image copyright Dorset Police Image caption Alanda Pike's blood alcohol level was three-and-a-half times the legal limit

A mother who killed her three-year-old daughter in a crash while drunk was an alcoholic with a history of drinking and driving, a report has found.

Louisa Pike was fatally injured in the crash on the A354 near Blandford, Dorset, in August last year.

Alanda Pike was jailed for six years and four months for causing her death.

Dorset Safeguarding Children Board (DSCB) said different agencies had been involved with the family but ""key links"" were not made.

The serious case review - which referred to Louisa as ""Child S"" - said Pike had concealed her alcoholism, but while pregnant in 2014 she was banned from driving after being caught four times over the drink-drive limit.

Vodka and cocaine

In April 2016, police were also called when a ""heavily intoxicated"" Pike dropped her baby in a supermarket, the report said.

It said police received anonymous calls claiming Pike was driving while drunk and, on one occasion, she was reported for failing to stop after hitting a cyclist, but a lack of evidence meant no action was taken.

The report said the girl's preschool raised concerns but social workers found the girl ""happy and talkative"".

Early on 24 August 2017, Pike crashed into a van at Thickthorn Cross, seriously injuring the driver. Her daughter was airlifted to hospital with head injuries but died the next day.

Pike admitted causing death and serious injury by dangerous driving and driving with excess alcohol.

Bournemouth Crown Court heard she had drunk half a 200ml bottle of vodka and had been drinking and taking cocaine the previous evening.

The report said some issues highlighted in the review had already improved including the introduction of a single point of contact for safeguarding concerns.

It said midwives were also expected to gather history in the early stages of pregnancy.

Independent chairwoman Sarah Elliott said: ""Although different agencies had been involved with the mother at different times, key links were not being made.

""It really does bring home the need for professionals to be curious and share information with one another, so they can consider the whole picture to help keep children safe.""","['death', 'alcoholism', 'review', 'different', 'report', 'driving', 'mum', 'drunk', 'crash', 'times', 'girls', 'safeguarding', 'mother', 'hid', 'blandford', 'pike', 'serious']","Louisa Pike was fatally injured in the crash on the A354 near Blandford, Dorset, in August last year.

'Why I drink 100 units of alcohol a week',Heavy drinkers share their boozing habits - including spending £500 a month on wine.,[],None,"Image copyright Getty Images

How much alcohol do you drink?

People have been sharing their drinking habits after presenter Adrian Chiles revealed he sometimes drank more than 100 units a week - more than seven times the recommended limit.

He said drinking never affects his life and he considers himself a social drinker, not an alcoholic.

Other heavy drinkers have been speaking about their alcohol consumption.

'Do I want to stop? No'

Paul Tomlinson, 48, from Thornton-Cleveleys in Lancashire says it is ""easy to rack up drinking when you're sat at home"".

""I regularly drink 80 to 100 units a week, most of it between Friday and Sunday.

""On each night I will usually have two or three beers - sometimes alcohol free now actually - followed by a bottle of wine and then two or three large gin and tonics.

""This is roughly 16 to 18 units a night for three consecutive nights. I will then do at least two or three more bottles of wine in the week with a couple of gin and tonics again.

Image copyright Paul Tomlinson Image caption Paul Tomlinson says society primes people to drink alcohol

""Do I consider myself an alcoholic? No! Do I want to stop drinking at the level I do? Not really.

""I have a disabled son who is 24 so don't go out often and as a result drink more at home.

""I don't go to bed feeling outrageously drunk and I don't black out on the sofa.""

'£500 a month on wine'

One man, who chose to remain anonymous, says his father was an ""old fashioned"" alcoholic who started drinking in the morning - but that he is not an alcoholic.

""I find myself in the habit of putting away one and a half to two bottles of white wine every night, unless I'm really thirsty in which case it might be two and a half bottles.

""I start at 6 or 7pm, couple of glasses whilst preparing family supper, continue through PS4 ""wind down"" time, another couple of glasses.

""Then usually finish off the second bottle whilst listening to music. Tada! £500 a month on wine.

""I'm in a strange position, as I can (and do) stop when I want to - sometimes for a month or two just to prove to myself I'm not an alcoholic like my dad.

""I'll go out with my mates and not touch a drop, again - just to prove a point to myself. And yet I still drink far, far too much.

""I'm rarely drunk nowadays, although obviously I still don't drive. I just wish someone would make a drink that tastes as nice as wine, without the alcohol.

""I'm currently losing weight and so have ""limited"" myself to a half to one bottle of wine a night.

""I find that the problem is the habit more than alcohol. I smoked 20 plus a day for 20 years then quit five years ago, with no patches etc.

""Never felt like a relapse, never been tempted to have 'just one'. I think alcohol is in the same category.

""Although, as I can testify with my father, the drug is insidious and rather than just kill your body, if you let it, it will kill your personality first.""

'I'm all or nothing'

Adrian Chiles' account of his alcohol consumption ""mirrors almost exactly"" how Mark Baker, 58, from North Somerset, says he drinks.

""Like him I drink about 80 to 100 units a week and have done so for many years.

""I have a slight fatty liver (as does he) but otherwise perfectly OK. I have never suffered from depression or anxiety.

""I drink mostly out of habit. I never get drunk, drink and drive, I never drink in the mornings or at lunchtime, I just like a drink in the evening to wind down and relax.

""I am an export manager so drinking is part of the territory.

""Last year in October I stopped drinking for a month. I was worried that I was dependent on it.

""I found it easy to do especially as there are so many products on the market with low or no alcohol. I could still have a beer, glass of wine or even a gin and tonic. Yes, there is low alcohol spirit.

""Like Adrian, I will probably give up drinking rather than rationing it as when I have tried that in the past it never seems to work. I am definitely an all or nothing person.""

'I will try and cut down'

Annemarie McAleese, 48, from Belfast, owns her own restaurant and says she starts drinking wine when she gets home as she ""potters about"".

""On average I would drink two bottles of white wine each night, and have done for the last seven years.

""I have my own business, and work in it five or six days per week.

""After reading this article, I think now is the time to rethink my drinking habits.

""It's a very bad habit. I think I will try to cut down. I think I use owning my business as an excuse because it can be quite stressful.

""I won't watch the programme with my husband because I don't need somebody yapping in my ear 'you need to stop', I need to do this for myself.""

'High functioning alcoholic'

John, from Essex, says he considered himself a ""moderate social drinker"" until he developed liver disease.

""Then I gave up drinking altogether but the liver disease worsened leading to many hospital visits and the need for a liver transplant.

""I had never missed work or put drink ahead of all else but when I detailed out my daily drinking to numerous doctors over a nine-month period I was embarrassed to realise that I was effectively a high-functioning alcoholic.

""I am pleased to say that thanks to my organ donor I have led a healthy, happy life for the last eight years and become a grandfather three times.

""Something I would have missed if I had carried on as before.

""If Adrian's show makes anyone seriously look at the amount they drink and reduce it then he is doing a great job.

""On the subject of giving up alcohol I feel sometimes too much is made of how difficult this is, rather than concentrating on the benefits of being sober.

""Better health, better sleep, no hangovers, higher alertness and an ability to enjoy things with a clear head.""

Alcohol and health

The number of adults who say they drink alcohol is at its lowest level since surveys began in 2005, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

The NHS recommends not drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week. If you do drink that much, it is best to spread it over three or more days.

One unit of alcohol is 10ml of pure alcohol, which is equivalent to half a pint of normal-strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits.

A small glass of wine contains about 1.5 units, a standard glass is 2.1 and a bottle of wine contains 10 units.

Meanwhile, a can of lager, beer or cider is two units. A pint is two or three units, depending on whether it is lower or higher strength.

According to the NHS, someone may need help if:","['think', 'units', 'alcohol', 'dont', 'stop', 'need', 'wine', '100', 'drink', 'drinking', 'week']","""I regularly drink 80 to 100 units a week, most of it between Friday and Sunday.

The headstones with unusual stories to tell,A tour around the interesting stories found lurking in English graveyards.,"['Bethan Bell', 'Bbc News']",None,"Image copyright Getty Images

Cemeteries offer a heady mix of history, beauty, nature and death to those who enjoy browsing around them. Burial grounds such as Highgate in north London, which host the graves of the rich and famous, draw thousands of visitors. But there are scores of other less well known but interesting graves around England.

The barmaid who taunted a tiger

Image copyright Getty Images

In 1703, Hannah Twynnoy became Britain's first recorded victim of a tiger.

She was a barmaid at the White Lion in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, when a travelling menagerie set up in the pub's large rear yard, ready to attract paying crowds.

Hannah was warned against upsetting the tiger but she enjoyed bothering and poking at the big cat - until one day it discovered the cage door was open. Fed up of the pesky barmaid, the tiger launched itself on the unfortunate servant and mauled her to death.

The stone, in Malmesbury Abbey has the epitaph:

In bloom of life

She's snatched from hence

She had not room to make defence;

For Tyger fierce

Took life away

And here she lies

In a bed of clay

Until the Resurrection Day.

The diver who saved a cathedral

Image copyright FindaGrave/Getty Images

William Walker was a deep-sea diver who, in 1905, was employed to help repair the foundations of Winchester Cathedral.

Large cracks had appeared in the cathedral's walls and vaulted ceilings, some of which were wide enough for owls to roost in.

Because Winchester has a high underlying water table and the cathedral is built on peaty soil, trenches dug below filled with water before any reinforcing work could be done.

So Walker, who usually worked at Portsmouth dockyard, was recruited.

A tunnel was excavated beneath the building and for six years he spent nearly six hours a day underwater, in darkness, replacing and shoring up the foundations with his bare hands. He worked entirely by touch. Eventually he propped the cathedral up with 900,000 bricks, 114,900 concrete blocks and 25,800 bags of cement.

Because it took him so long to put on and take off his heavy diving suit, when he stopped for a break he would just take off his helmet in order to eat his lunch and smoke his pipe.

As if that was not enough effort, each weekend he cycled 150 miles - home to Croydon, south London, before returning to work on Monday.

He died aged 49 during the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918. His grave, at Beckenham Cemetery in Bromley, south-east London, bears the words: ""The diver who with his own hands saved Winchester Cathedral.""

The soldier whose beer was too weak

In Winchester, there is a grave which pays homage to a 26-year-old grenadier in the North Regiment of the Hants Militia. Thomas Thetcher died after drinking contaminated small (weak) beer when he was hot.

Before the invention of modern sanitation, people would drink small beer when fresh water was unavailable. This was because the alcohol was toxic to water-borne pathogens.

However, it was not enough to prevent Thetcher catching a fever and dying.

Following his death in 1764, his comrades arranged for a jocular headstone inscription warning of the dangers of drink. It read:

Here sleeps in peace a Hampshire Grenadier,

Who caught his death by drinking cold small beer,

Soldiers be wise from his untimely fall

And when ye're hot drink strong or none at all.

In 1918, the tombstone caught the attention of a young American soldier called Bill Wilson, who was camped nearby with his US Army unit.

Twenty-one years later, following a battle with alcoholism, he founded Alcoholics Anonymous and in 1939 published a book about his experience.

In it he claimed the gravestone had been an ""ominous warning which I failed to heed"", and printed the first two lines of the verse in the front of his book.

However, it appears he misunderstood the headstone, as he missed out the crucial advice about only drinking strong beer.

On 12 May - the anniversary of Thetcher's death - people gather at the grave to drink (strong) beer and raise a glass to the grenadier.

Peter the Wild Boy

Image copyright Neale Monks/Historic Royal Palaces

Peter had been found living alone and naked in a German forest in 1725. He could not talk, and would scamper about on all fours rather than walk.

When he was about 12 he was brought to London by King George I where he became a ""human pet"" at Kensington Palace. However, his inability to learn table manners or speech, hatred of wearing clothes - even his specially-made green velvet suit - and lack of decorum led to him falling out of favour.

The court paid for him to retire to a Hertfordshire farm with a generous pension and when he died, aged about 72, the locals paid for a headstone. Even today, flowers are laid on his grave.

Peter's funeral was held at St Mary's Church, Northchurch, Hertfordshire, and was paid for by the government. His gravestone was provided by local people.

At the time, courtiers assumed Peter's behaviour was the result of being brought up by wolves or bears. However, modern analysis of a portrait suggests Peter had a rare genetic condition known as Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome.

The bleeding tombstone of Richard Smith

St Mary's Church in Hinckley, Leicestershire, is the last resting place of Richard Smith who was killed on 12 April 1727, aged 20.

Although his headstone is fairly run-of-the-mill, the story behind his death serves as an abject warning to young men with a fondness for messing about when they should be paying attention.

According to the local history club, a recruiting sergeant for the army had come to Hinckley and was singing the praises of taking the King's shilling. Richard, rather than listening, made jokes and quips until the recruiter lost his temper. In a slight overreaction, the soldier gave the crowd an unplanned demonstration in how to use a pike in close quarter combat - and killed Richard.

For years there were reports of the headstone appearing red and tradition held the gravestone sweated blood on the anniversary of the murder.

However, a more prosaic explanation was suggested by a researcher in 1936. The gravestone used to be positioned under a block of red sandstone and it was thought that the ""blood"" being sweated may have resulted in water dripping from this block.

The Woodplumpton Witch

Nestled among the neat headstones at St Anne's churchyard in Woodplumpton, near Preston, is a boulder marking the grave of Meg Shelton.

Known as ""the Fylde Hag"", she was accused of witchcraft in the late 17th Century. Allegations centred on the fairly tame ""stealing milk"" and the more-impressive ""turning herself into a animal"".

She was killed in mysterious circumstances when a barrel crushed her against the wall of her cottage.

Folklore has it she dug her way out of her grave on more than one occasion. She was eventually buried head down in a narrow shaft so that if she tried to claw her way out she would be heading in the wrong direction - and instead burrow her way to Hell.

The boulder was put on top as an extra way of keeping her anchored in the grave.

According to legend, if you walk three times around the boulder while chanting ""I don't believe in witches"", Meg's bony hand will rise from her grave and grasp your ankle.","['death', 'copyright', 'headstones', 'gravestone', 'headstone', 'drink', 'grave', 'london', 'unusual', 'way', 'water', 'tell', 'winchester']","Image copyright Getty ImagesCemeteries offer a heady mix of history, beauty, nature and death to those who enjoy browsing around them.

Food addiction: could overeating be compulsive?,Alcoholism researcher Sally Marlow examines whether food addiction could be fuelling a rise in obesity,"['Sally Marlow', 'Addiction Researcher', 'Institute Of Psychiatry']",None,"Image copyright Science Photo Library

Scientists are divided over whether or not addiction could be contributing to rising global obesity. Does food addiction really exist and - if it does - how can it be treated?

Getting a grip on addiction can be incredibly hard, as anyone who has ever tried to give up smoking, alcohol or even caffeine will testify.

A tried and tested tactic is to avoid the thing you're addicted to - giving up going to pubs for a while, or not to have cigarettes in the house.

Even with these measures people often struggle and fail repeatedly.

But what if the thing you are addicted to has to be kept in the house, and worse, has to be something you sit down in front of three times a day?

As obesity levels continue to rise, the scientific community is starting to look for similarities between overeating and addiction.

The EU has funded a project called NeuroFAST to bring all the evidence together.

About the author Sally Marlow is an alcohol addiction researcher at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London. She has reported on alcohol for Radio 4's Today programme and for Inside Health

Researchers are cautious. So far there is only one type of eating disorder where it is thought addiction plays a role: Binge Eating Disorder, a side effect of which is often obesity.

Although we tend to trivialise the idea of addiction and food being related - many of us have at some point referred to ourselves as addicted to chocolate - Binge Eating Disorder is something which holds people within its grip.

It causes physical and psychological harm and is utterly miserable. Just like other forms of addiction.

One of the people I spoke to as part of my research, Michael, is an articulate, educated professional and a former overeater.

He said: ""It's difficult for others to understand. Everyone overeats and they think it's just a bigger version of that.

""It's a completely different experience - a constant, daily minute-to-minute obsession about getting the substance, food.

""It is hell being there in that place.""

Louise, another of those I met, provides a compelling testimony for addiction being at work in overeating.

She also had a serious alcohol problem and understands addiction more than most.

""I think what's most interesting is the similarities in behaviour,"" she says.

What is Binge Eating Disorder? A feeling of compulsion to overeat on a regular basis, sometimes including pre-planned binges

Those affected consume large amounts of food in a short time, often when they are not hungry

Overeating usually happens in private, leaving the person feeling out of control or guilty

The disorder is linked to obesity and conditions like high blood pressure and heart disease

Treatments include anti-depressants and cognitive therapies Source: NHS

""As an alcoholic I would go to different off-licences to buy my alcohol so people wouldn't recognise me, but I'd also go to different newsagents to buy chocolate so they wouldn't recognise me.

""Sneaking it into the house, not wanting people to see, hiding food, like an alcoholic hiding bottles, hiding empties.""

Dr Nora Volkow, a prominent neuroscientist and head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse in the United States, is clear in her mind that there are biological processes underpinning what Michael and Louise describe.

She has found that a neurotransmitter called dopamine, which is known to be involved in addiction, behaves in the brain in the same way in those who are heavily addicted to drugs and those who are obese.

For her this is strong evidence that food, or eating, can be addictive.

Not everybody agrees. Professor Jane Ogden, a psychologist at the University of Surrey, believes the label of addiction can be unhelpful for those who overeat - it removes personal responsibility and hinders recovery.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The number of obese people in the UK has more than trebled in 25 years

""The addiction world has given us a strong narrative that says you have no control - things in your brain are wanting more sugar or chocolate"" she says.

But if food is like other addictions, we should theoretically see overlaps in successful treatments.

Addiction treatment has a goal of either complete abstinence or reducing harm - for example by prescribing methadone or nicotine gum.

For those working towards abstinence, one tried and tested model is the 12-step programme developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, with versions for drugs used by Narcotics Anonymous and gambling by Gamblers Anonymous.

Twenty years ago people were reluctant to accept that gambling could be addictive, but now there is widespread acceptance of this idea

Michael and Louise are both members of Overeaters Anonymous. It works in much the same way as the other 12-step programmes with peer-led group confidential meetings, personal mentors, and a structured programme of steps to work through.

There is no doubt that for some it's highly successful, just like Alcoholics Anonymous can be.

It's not possible to abstain from eating, of course, but it is possible to abstain from overeating.

For Louise, abstinence is three healthy meals a day, no wheat and no chocolate. For Michael his abstinence food plan is determined by his sponsor - he is told by someone else what he is allowed to eat.

Other treatments are more radical.

In alcohol addiction, the body can be altered so that it rejects alcohol by implanting a drug known as antabuse.

If alcohol is consumed, the body reacts with nausea.

Similarly in overeating, the body can be altered by bariatric surgery - a gastric band, bypass or sleeve, which restricts the volume of the stomach available for food.

It sounds extreme but it works for most people, and the evidence shows the risks of surgery are far outweighed by the health benefits of losing excess weight.

People live longer, and have fewer heart and mobility problems. Diabetes is even reversed in some cases, and people report a massively improved quality of life.

The possible relationships between food and addiction are incredibly complicated, and there is a lot we do not yet understand.

Twenty years ago people were reluctant to accept that gambling could be addictive, but now there is widespread acceptance of this idea, and good evidence to support it.

Are we at the same place with food - waiting for the evidence and attitudes to change?

Nicola Schlesinger, a counsellor, works with women who have addiction problems and eating disorders. What would she say to those scientists who do not believe food can be addictive?

""They don't necessarily have the people sitting in front of them that I have on a daily basis in tears, in pain, hating themselves, feeling suicidal,"" she says.

Hopefully NeuroFAST and others will move us closer to narrowing the gap between scientists on both sides of the debate, and find solutions for people who do feel a compulsion to overeat.

Drinkers 'ignorant' about alcohol,,[],5/19/2008 1:31,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement Three-quarters of drinkers do not know a typical glass of wine contains three units of alcohol, a survey for the Department of Health suggests. The YouGov survey of 1,429 drinkers in England found more than a third did not know their recommended daily limit - 2-3 units for women and 3-4 for men. The survey coincides with a government campaign to promote careful drinking. Ministers are concerned people are unaware that glass sizes have increased and some drinks have become stronger. The internet survey found half those questioned drank alcohol at least two or three times a week. And although 82% said they knew what a unit of alcohol was, 77% did not know how many units were in a typical large glass of wine. GPs are used to hearing half truths about half measures - people need to have a better grasp of how much they're drinking by adding up their units

Professor Steve Field, Royal College of GPs

Alcohol units Drinking diaries More than half (55%) thought a large glass of wine would contain two units, when it actually contains three. Nearly three out of five (58%) did not know a double gin and tonic contains two units. More than a third (35%) did not know that an average pint of beer (ABV 4%) contains more than two units - although some strong lagers contain three units. And 36% of women and 50% of men knew their recommended daily drinking limits were 2-3 units and 3-4 units respectively. The Office of National Statistics revamped its assessment method to take into account the increased glass sizes and strength of alcoholic drinks last December. Ordinary families The Know Your Limits campaign aims to tell drinkers how many units are now in their drinks and help them stick to their recommended limits. Some lagers contain three units There is a series of new adverts on television, radio and newspapers showing the number of units in individual drinks. The adverts use ordinary family situations to help people understand how many units are in typical alcoholic drinks and warns them how too much regular drinking can damage their health. Public Health Minister Dawn Primarolo said people are not necessarily aware of how much they drink and how much it can harm their health. ""Glass sizes have grown larger and the strength of many wines and beers has increased, so it's no wonder some of us have lost track of our alcohol consumption. ""We aim to give people the facts about how many units are in different drinks in a non-judgemental way. Then they can then make their own assessments about how much they want to drink in the future."" Older drinkers Mrs Primarolo said the campaign was aimed at over 25s who were less aware of what a unit was than younger people. Some 32% of drinkers aged 18-24 correctly said that a large glass of wine contains three units, compared with just 18% of drinkers over 55. Royal College of General Practitioners chairman Professor Steve Field said: ""When it comes to alcohol GPs are used to hearing half truths about half measures. HAVE YOUR SAY I don't have a clue how many units are in most drinks, but I do know when I have had enough Joe Delaney, London ""People need to have a better grasp of how much they're drinking by adding up their units. ""Alcohol can be a major contributing factor in many health disorders so it's vital that people think about how much alcohol they drink,"" he said. Joe Korner, from The Stroke Association, said the organisation fully supports efforts to make people aware of the health risks associated with excessive drinking. ""There are around 1,100 haemorrhagic stroke deaths every year associated with alcohol and statistics show that women who drink over double their recommended limits are more than four times likely to suffer a stroke, and men almost twice as likely,"" he said. Mark Hastings, of the British Beer and Pub Association, said: ""We fully support the aim of giving people information on which to make their own decisions. ""But the government needs to be careful not to target the sensible majority while failing to tackle abuse by the minority. ""What people need is realistic advice and sensible action, not interference with their own judgement.""

Alcohol-related deaths 'rising',,[],1/25/2008 10:37,"Men still drink more than women

Units explained

Office for National Statistics figures show there were 13.4 alcohol-related deaths per 100,000 population in 2006 - up from 12.9 in 2005.

The mortality rate in men (18.3/100,000) was more than twice the rate for females (8.8/100,000).

The overall death rate has almost doubled from 6.9 deaths per 100,000 people in 1991.

It appears that for certain younger people who've been drinking heavily for most of their lives, the consequences are beginning to show themselves at ever earlier stages

Frank Soodeen

Alcohol Concern

In total 8,758 deaths were linked to alcohol in 2006, compared to 4,144 deaths in 1991.

For men, the death rates in all age groups increased between 1991 and 2006.

The biggest increase was for men aged 35-54. Rates in this age group more than doubled over the period, from 13.4 to 31.1 deaths per 100,000.

However, the highest rates in each year were for men aged 55-74.

Similar pattern in women

Death rates by age group for females were consistently lower than rates for males.

However, the death rate for women aged 35­54 doubled between 1991 and 2006, from 7.2 to 14.8 per 100,000 population.

The government desperately needs to take a tougher approach with the alcohol and retail industry

Sarah Matthews

British Liver Trust

Again, the highest rates in each year were for the 55-74 age group.

Frank Soodeen, of the charity Alcohol Concern, said: ""The link between alcohol misuse and ill health is well established.

""However these figures reveal some disturbing trends. For the second year in a row, the biggest rise in deaths has been among men aged 35-54.

""It appears that for certain younger people who've been drinking heavily for most of their lives, the consequences are beginning to show themselves at ever earlier stages.

""It is vital that the government finally starts investing more in alcohol treatment to help problem drinkers address these issues before the situation becomes irretrievable.""

Dr Christopher Record, a liver disease consultant based in Newcastle, said: ""There is terrific pressure in society for people to drink. Those that don't drink are considered to be freaks and abnormal.

""But the main reason why, we are drinking more is alcohol is too cheap. Alcohol now is 50% less expensive that it was 25 years ago and, needless to say, consumption has gone up by 50% pro rata.""

Professor Ian Gilmore, President of the Royal College of Physicians, was particularly concerned by the rise in deaths among women.

""My colleagues and I are certainly seeing more women with serious liver damage than ever before in our clinics,"" he said.

Tougher line call

Sarah Matthews, of the British Liver Trust, said that a major part of the problem was that alcohol was cheap, readily available and glamorised by celebrities.

""The government desperately needs to take a tougher approach with the alcohol and retail industry, clamping down on cheap promotions and irresponsible advertising - particularly before the 9pm watershed.

""Clear and effective health warnings on alcohol like 'alcohol kills' would also help in raising awareness of the damage that alcohol can have.""

Public Health Minister Dawn Primarolo said the government was launching a £10m education campaign to raise awareness of alcohol, and reviewing alcohol pricing and promotion.

It had also toughened enforcement of underage sales by retailers, and planned more help for people who wanted to drink less.

She said: ""We know we're not going to change people's attitudes to alcohol overnight - it's going to take time, but it's reassuring to see that figures, published earlier this week, suggest alcohol consumption is no longer on the rise.""","['alcohol', 'men', 'rise', 'liver', 'drink', 'rate', 'deaths', 'rising', 'age', 'aged', 'alcoholrelated', 'rates']","Men still drink more than womenUnits explainedOffice for National Statistics figures show there were 13.4 alcohol-related deaths per 100,000 population in 2006 - up from 12.9 in 2005.

I begged social services to take my children away,Sam spent more than 20 years as an addict before overcoming a cycle of trauma and abusive relationships.,[],None,"Sam spent more than 20 years as an addict, battling to get clean and sober. But she didn't want the methadone she was repeatedly prescribed by her local drugs service - she wanted to be abstinent. She tells Milly Chowles how she overcame a cycle of trauma and abusive relationships to beat her addictions by herself.

My husband didn't tell me it was heroin when he gave it to me to smoke. He told me it was cannabis resin. And then after about a week I really started to feel unwell.

There was a programme on the telly about a boy who had a habit and was withdrawing and I linked it to what I was experiencing. I woke my husband up in the middle of the night and absolutely went ballistic.

We had two children by then. I can remember saying: ""I don't want to do this no more, I don't want to go further,"" and begging him not to go and score. And he just didn't listen to me.

I remember just sitting in that front room watching him smoking, and feeling defeated.

The crack came in about a week later. I can remember watching him smoking it and he was going: ""Just try one, just try one,"" and I was like: ""No, no, I will never ever smoke that stuff,"" and I'd believe it when I was saying that.

But in the end I gave in, and I didn't stop for the best part of the next two decades.

It is a phenomenal force. It just takes over you.

I'd started shoplifting and offending, minor offences. I got arrested quite quickly and I went to prison.

My first sentence was only eight weeks, of which I served four. While I was there the children went into care for a little while. I managed to get them back when I came out, but two months later I'd been sectioned.

So I rang up social services from the psychiatric hospital and said: ""You need to go round to my house and take my children."" They'd been left with my husband who was using drugs - I knew they weren't safe. And they came, they took them, and they were adopted within a year. They never returned to my care again.

The adoption papers were signed while I was in prison. I'd gone from psychiatric hospital back on to the streets, back into prison. And that's how my life was for 15 years - in and out of psychiatric hospitals and in and out of prisons.

You can listen again to Milly Chowles' reports for The Fix here

I can remember my last visit with my children and the obsession to use drugs was so strong that even as I took them down to the car, I was texting my dealer.

People say: ""Oh you'll find acceptance around it."" I accept that I was ill. And I can honestly say that would not have happened if I didn't have the substance in me. But it's something that I still haven't forgiven myself for. I don't know if I ever will.

I take full responsibility for my using and I don't blame my husband. I have an illness.

But addiction all comes down to relationships and being hurt again and again, and being left with no trust. I was always in a relationship and every relationship was dysfunctional. Every single one.

The really sad part of it is that I really thought these men loved me. When I began doing sex work they would sit and wait for me to get home and then they'd go to score with the money I'd just earned. Looking back now I really kick myself that I allowed that to happen - that I'd go out and let that stuff happen to me, and then give over my money and share what I'd just earned with somebody who didn't value me whatsoever.

How could they watch me go out there night after night, somebody who they're supposed to love and care about? I don't know how they could touch me after I'd gone and done that stuff.

One night I had a really bad experience. A punter raped me in his car. I just got out of that car. I didn't go home, I didn't tell my husband. I went back out and I found another punter. I don't remember much of the night but I remember those two punters.

I went straight back out again because of the obsession to use more drugs. I needed the money. It's that powerful. That's the control drugs had over me.

In the end I met somebody else while my husband was in prison, serving a long sentence. I went from this co-dependent using relationship to a very violent abusive relationship. The progression with each relationship, it just got worse. And again I stayed.

Once he headbutted me, to the point that I passed out. When I came round the first thing I said was, ""Oh, give me a cuddle please."" And I'm the one saying sorry for something I haven't done. Absolutely nuts.

I stayed in that relationship for about eight years.

It wasn't the heroin or crack that brought me to my knees in the end, it was the alcohol.

The two children from my second relationship had gone off to live with family. I was isolated in a flat on my own and my life for 18 months was waking up, and getting as much Tennent's Super in me as I could. Some days I was too frightened to go out the door and get my methadone script - I would rather sit there and withdraw as long as I had the Tennent's.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How ""Sam"" was introduced to drugs by her husband.

I couldn't even open the curtains in the end. Couldn't take sunlight on my face. I did not want to be in any type of reality at all.

I despised myself, absolutely despised myself.

My friend Pat died six days before I was due to go into rehab. I can remember just smashing my flat up. I must have been screaming so loudly that my neighbours rang the police and the police kicked my door in.

I was on my front-room floor, screaming that I didn't want to die. I'd never had a policeman hug me, but one of them hugged me. I must have looked such a mess.

I think it was in that moment I knew I'd had enough, I'd really had enough of it.

I'd been fighting to get into recovery for a long time. There were three different treatment centres and numerous detoxes along the way. But in May 2014 I went off to a treatment centre in Weston-super-Mare. I was so angry when I got there that they put me on a behavioural contract almost immediately. They said if I didn't conform to it and stop arguing with everyone, that I would be discharged. I looked at this contract one night and thought: ""I'm not going to be able to do this."" And I knew if I got discharged I'd use. So I decided to take control and made a decision to leave of my own accord.

I was still heavily scripted on methadone and valium, I hadn't finished my alcohol detox. And I told them I was going. And they said: ""Where are you going?"" And I said I was going to a Narcotics Anonymous meeting in London. And they looked at me like I was an absolute lunatic. And I probably was, a bit.

It was a big leap of faith. I was homeless because I couldn't go back to my flat because of bail conditions. I went to a meeting in Soho in London. And I sat in that meeting and I asked for help and that's what I got.

Three people in that meeting aren't with us any more, they're dead. I really do grasp how lucky I am.

After nearly 20 years of addiction and in drugs and alcohol services, the services didn't help me stop using. In fact, if anything I feel they kept me using longer with methadone prescriptions. They never once mentioned mutual aid groups. Their answer every time was more medication, never abstinence.

I stopped my script dead and I got clean in the meetings. And I am proud of that.

This month I will have been clean for three-and-a-half years.

Help with addiction

It's not been easy. I got made homeless six months ago which was really frightening, really scary. It was an on-the-spot eviction, I was asked to leave straight away. I didn't know where I was going. I didn't know what I was doing. But I got through it and I stayed clean.

I have complex PTSD, which I put down to to the sex working I did during my addiction. It affects every area of my life because I am so easily triggered. But I'm determined to recover from it. I didn't come into recovery to be like this. But it's manageable. I manage it, to get by.

I'm rebuilding a relationship with my oldest two children, and this Christmas was the first time I've had my daughter with me since 2012.

I now run women's recovery groups in a day centre and I'm doing well at college - I left school when I was 13.

No, I don't have a flat. No, I'm not in full-time employment. I'm living in a hostel, which is challenging at times, very challenging. But every time I look out my window and it's raining, gratitude just comes over me that I haven't got to go out in that rain and wait for a punter to come and pick me up.

It's not perfect at the minute, it's not great. But… it's all right. Life's all right.

'I woke up with Kevin Spacey lying on me',A man tells the Victoria Derbyshire programme the Hollywood star groomed him in the mid-1980s.,[],None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The man, who did not want to be identified, says he woke up with Spacey's head on his stomach

A man has said he was left traumatised after waking up to find Hollywood star Kevin Spacey lying on him when he was a teenager in the 1980s.

The man told Victoria Derbyshire Spacey invited him to spend the weekend in New York but it became clear he was interested in ""a way I wasn't"".

He said Spacey asked him to share his bed, but he slept on the sofa and woke up with the actor's arms around him.

The BBC has contacted Spacey for a comment.

John, not his real name, added he didn't believe anything sexual took place, but said: ""I was uncomfortable at best, traumatised at worst.""

Image copyright AFP Image caption Kevin Spacey is a double Oscar winner and was artistic director at London's Old Vic for 11 years

The latest allegation follows Spacey's apology after US actor Anthony Rapp accused him of making a sexual advance towards him when he was 14.

Rapp told how Spacey laid down on top of him in a bedroom during a party at the older man's flat in 1986.

The Double Oscar-winner said he was ""beyond horrified"" to hear the story and did not remember the encounter.

Other men have now come forward, accusing Spacey of sexual harassment.

US filmmaker Tony Montana told Radar Online he suffered from PTSD for six months after Spacey allegedly grabbed his crotch in a Los Angeles bar in 2003.

And Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos, who acted in several plays at the Old Vic, claimed in a Facebook post Spacey ""routinely preyed"" on young male actors.

'Hand on thigh'

Speaking to the programme, John said he first met the Broadway actor in 1984 at a summer theatre when he was 16.

The pair exchanged letters and, a year later, when John was 17, Spacey invited him to spend a weekend at his home in New York City.

John told how a ""charming and brotherly"" Spacey showed him around the city, took him out for dinner and introduced him to famous friends on their weekend together.

On the first evening, Spacey talked a lot about his work and became affectionate ""in a way I certainly wasn't interested in"", he said.

He put his hand on John's thigh, an arm around his shoulder and rubbed his arm.

'Icy goodnight'

At bedtime, John said Spacey asked him to share his bed, but John insisted on sleeping on the sofa.

""It was an icy 'goodnight' with the lights off. I thought I was going to be kicked out in the morning,"" he said.

""As we went to sleep, he was sobbing from his bed,"" said John.

He said he felt it was attention-seeking behaviour in an attempt to get him to respond.

The following morning, John said he woke up with Spacey's head on his stomach and his arms wrapped around him.

""He was in his underwear, I was fully clothed. I supposed it was some sort of New York theatre actor 'good morning,'"" he said.

'Stupid or predatory'

After a second day enjoying New York, John said once back at the flat, Spacey became affectionate again and told him he felt ""misunderstood"".

""I burst into tears because I couldn't articulate any more what was happening to me. I was scared,"" said John.

""To his credit, he backed off and we went to sleep.""

John said he is telling his story now after reading about Rapp's similar experience and he wants young people to know they should be vigilant and speak out.

""It seems he was grooming me,"" John said.

""For me, I never let on that that's what I was interested in. I never discussed it, nor did I want it.

""I was uncomfortable at best, traumatised at worst.

""He was either very stupid or predatory - or maybe a little of both.""

John points out that neither of them drank any alcohol that weekend.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Anthony Rapp, now 46, appeared in Star Trek: Discovery

He said he didn't tell his parents or the authorities at the time because he thought Spacey's behaviour might have been ""permissible"" and worried he might have ""given off a vibe"" that he was interested in Spacey.

The BBC is seeking a response from Spacey.

In light of Rapp's allegations, Netflix has suspended production of political drama, House of Cards, in which Spacey stars.

"Drinking, sex, eating: Why don't we tell the truth in surveys?",Many people are under-reporting how much alcohol they are drinking. But what else are we fibbing to researchers about and why do we do it?,"['Brian Wheeler', 'Bbc News Magazine']",None,"Many people are under-reporting how much alcohol they are drinking. But what else are we fibbing to researchers about and why do we do it?

""I have the occasional sweet sherry. Purely medicinal.""

It is a classic British sitcom scene. An inveterate boozer telling a little white lie about how much they drink to a doctor or other authority figure.

But the tendency to paint a less-than-honest picture about your unhealthy habits and lifestyle is not just restricted to alcohol. People also tend to kid themselves about how much exercise they are doing.

It is understandable that people want to present a positive image of themselves to friends, family and colleagues. But why fib to researchers?

After all, the man or woman from the Office for National Statistics or Ipsos Mori can't order you to go on a diet or lay off the wine.

It is a question that has been puzzling social scientists for decades.

They even have a name for it - The Social Desirability Bias.

""People respond to surveys in the way they think they ought to. It is otherwise known as lying,"" says Kate Fox, an alcohol and drinking culture expert who has done research for both the government and the drinks industry.

Image caption The recycling never lies

""People also kid themselves about how much they drink, but it applies to most surveys, which is why one has to use other methods to really find out what is going on.""

It is a particular problem when it comes to ""sins"" such as alcohol and food.

Britain is one of a handful of nations - including the US - that has an ""ambivalent drinking culture"", says Fox. It is particularly prevalent in countries that have had a strong temperance movement.

People respond to surveys in the way they think they ought to - it is otherwise known as lying Kate Fox

""We have a morally charged relationship with alcohol, a love/hate relationship. It is a bit of a forbidden fruit.""

In countries with an ""integrated drinking culture"", such as more Latin nations, drinking is a ""morally neutral issue, only marginally more controversial than coffee and tea"".

It is easy to see why people would want to make themselves look good - even to a clipboard-wielding researcher they have just met.

But what about when the researcher leaves the room? Or hands them a separate questionnaire to be filled in privately? They're all tactics used by researchers to try and iron out the Social Desirability Bias.

""You still want to project a positive image of yourself even if the survey is anonymous,"" says Bobby Duffy, managing director of Ipsos Mori's Social Research Institute.

The gap between the amount of alcohol being sold in the UK and the amount people said they were drinking, was first observed in the 1980s, he says.

More from the Magazine ""The news is chock full of surveys. Many are blatant self-promotion and/or statistical garbage. When a women's magazine reports a survey of the nation's sexual habits, you might wonder whether it's really what the people of Great Britain are up to, or just a good way of selling a magazine."" What the survey didn't say (5 August 2008)

""People have unrealistic expectations about what other people are doing and that does affect how they how they respond.

""They think other people are drinking a lot less alcohol, doing more exercise and having a lot more sex and that changes their view of their own behaviour.""

The gap between perception and reality might be particularly acute in the UK, he suggests.

Awareness of healthy eating in the UK is among the highest in Europe, yet the country also has the highest obesity rates.

The key, says Duffy, is to view survey results as part of a bigger picture - and, he stresses, it is still possible to track overall social trends from self-reported surveys.

But if people underestimate how much they drink, do they overestimate how often they have sex?

The sex survey has been a surefire way to boost the circulation of a newspaper or magazine for decades.

Yet there is anxiety among sexual researchers that they are not as accurate as they should be.

Image caption Surveys can overestimate how often couples have sex

""In a large number of these surveys people inflate how often they have sex. They are buying into this idea that great sex is measured by how often you have it,"" says Petra Boynton, senior lecturer in International Health Care Research at University College London.

""We do have an anxiety about trusting sex research generally, partly because of worries over talking about sex but recently more because of the misuse of the survey tool as an advertising device.

It is hardly surprising, she says, that journalists and the public don't trust sex research:

""What they see shared in mainstream media is not the careful and more balanced work undertaken in social and health research.

""As sex stories on relationships advice in media are pinned on 'statistics', then this allows the dodgy PR polls to be used to tell us how we should be having sex and set up ideas about what is normal.""

More women and young people are developing health problems

Teenage drinkers

Of 115 specialists who replied to a BBC questionnaire, 77 said they had treated at least one patient aged under 25.

Many said the social acceptability of heavy drinking was the most important influence on young people.

The warning comes as a new alliance calls for a rise in alcohol taxes, and a bar on TV advertising before 9pm.

Twenty-four organisations, representing doctors and charities, have joined together to form the Alcohol Health Alliance.

It wants the government to make alcohol misuse a higher priority.

Public health minister Dawn Primarolo said the government had already drawn up a plan for concerted action.

The drink industry says alcohol consumption is falling, and that increasing the cost would hit the majority of people who enjoy a drink in moderation.

Generational shift

The comments of the specialists who responded to the BBC reveal a generational shift on hospital wards around the UK.

Whereas before most hospital consultants would have seen patients in their fifties or sixties in the past, they now describe seeing patients in their early twenties with alcohol-related hepatitis, and women whose livers are permanently damaged with the scarring known as cirrhosis by the time they are 30.

Dr Jonathan Mitchell, a consultant hepatologist in Plymouth, is one of the specialists who contacted the BBC.

He said many of his patients did not realise the permanent damage to their health caused by regular heavy drinking.

Until it reaches a critical stage most liver disease is virtually without symptoms.

Dr Mitchell said: ""I've seen patients who've been admitted with pretty catastrophic bleeding from stomach and oesophagus with no prior warning of a problem of their liver.

""Others may present with jaundice or swelling of the abdomen because there's a lot of fluid in the abdomen.

""All these three things are signs of quite advanced liver disease and can come out of the blue.""

Heavy drinking 'normal'

Fatty deposits gradually build up on the liver as alcohol interferes with the way it would normally be processed.

What follows is an inflammation within the liver which often leads to low grade hepatitis.

Although the liver has a remarkable capacity to regenerate the damage eventually reaches the stage where the scarring permanently alters the structure of the liver.

For some patients this will lead to an agonising wait on the liver transplant waiting list before they are forty.

He is not alone in his concerns that the normalisation of heavy drinking is putting a generation at risk from a silent killer.

Of the 115 consultants who contacted the BBC 101 said there had been an increase in the number of patients they were seeing for alcohol-related disease.

The shift in the age profile of their patients is also very marked, with 77 saying they had treated a patient under the age of 25.

If you look at the burden of damage to society, it's hugely greater for alcohol than for drugs.

The doctor's responses are a depressing snapshot of the ages and condition of the patients they see:

24-year-old woman with advanced cirrhosis who died

25-year-old with advanced alcoholic cirrhosis

19-year-old female with end stage liver disease

21-year-old who died from acute alcohol poisoning.

While attention is often focused on the social disorder caused by binge drinking, many doctors say the serious health effects are not given enough attention.

Professor Ian Gilmore, president of the Royal College of Physicians, is one of the leading figures in the new campaign.

He said: ""If you look at the burden of damage to society, it's hugely greater for alcohol than for drugs, but the majority of money has always gone on drugs, partly because of the strong link to crime.""

Government view

The government has recently beefed up its Home Office target for reducing harm from alcohol.

It has also introduced a cross-departmental Alcohol Strategy.

This includes a public information campaign to promote sensible drinking, an independent review of alcohol pricing and promotion, toughened enforcement of underage sales by retailers and plans to introduce more help for people who want to drink less.

Dawn Primarolo, the public health minister, said the government had introduced a comprehensive strategy to tackle problem drinking.

She said tax on alcohol in the UK was already the second highest in Europe, and only about 1% of pubs had extended opening hours since extended licensing laws were introduced.

A bigger problem was the discounting of prices by supermarkets and off licences.

She said: ""We're looking at where it's available, who it's available to, how it's being marketed, what the targeting is and what we can do to give clear messages and to make those who are selling it responsible.""","['alcohol', 'patients', 'stage', 'problem', 'warning', 'hits', 'liver', 'young', 'drinking', 'disease', 'health', 'damage', 'bbc', 'hard']","The warning comes as a new alliance calls for a rise in alcohol taxes, and a bar on TV advertising before 9pm.

Welsh Lib Dem William Powell AM warned on inappropriate behaviour,"Lib Dem AM William Powell has been given a formal written warning after a young activist complained of his inappropriate behaviour, it emerges.",[],None,"Image caption William Powell pictured during a debate in the Senedd

Lib Dem AM William Powell has been given a formal written warning after a young activist complained of his inappropriate behaviour, it has emerged.

The woman, now 21, alleged that in 2011 he gave her and two other women the strong alcoholic drink absinthe, touched her leg and put his hands round their waists.

The Mid and West Wales AM offered an unreserved apology.

The Lib Dems confirmed the warning.

The incident involving Mr Powell, his party's agriculture spokesman, was reported in the Daily Mail newspaper.

The article also refers to allegations about the behaviour of the former Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomeryshire Lembit Opik.

Anonymous

It claims he tried to kiss the activist when she was 17. Mr Opik denies the allegations.

In a statement on Saturday the Welsh Lib Dems said they received an anonymous complaint in May last year about William Powell's behaviour in an incident in June 2011, after the complainant had spoken to the chair of her local party.

She said she did not want to pursue a formal grievance procedure and wished to remain anonymous, but wanted the party to be aware of the issue.

The Welsh Lib Dems say the complaint was treated seriously, a report was compiled and passed to its chief whip in Cardiff Bay, Aled Roberts.

Mr Powell was interviewed by Mr Roberts and given a formal written warning that such behaviour would not be tolerated.

'Cooperated fully'

I apologised to the chief whip and offered an unreserved apology, through him, to anyone else for any hurt or offence caused William Powell, Mid and West Wales AM

He was told any future misdemeanour could result in ""more serious sanctions being imposed"".

The party says that no further complaint has been received since.

William Powell himself said in a statement: ""I am aware of an anonymous complaint having been made.

""The complaint was put to me by the chief whip and I cooperated fully with him in this matter.

""I apologised to the chief whip and offered an unreserved apology, through him, to anyone else for any hurt or offence caused and I would certainly wish to do so again, in writing or in person.""

The incident is a further embarrassment for the Liberal Democrats.

At Westminster they have suspended the MP Mike Hancock after a report into claims of sexual misconduct towards a female constituent was leaked, and suspended the party membership of Lord Rennard after he refused to apologise over claims of sexual harassment that he denies.","['unreserved', 'dem', 'william', 'welsh', 'lib', 'warned', 'behaviour', 'whip', 'party', 'powell', 'chief', 'inappropriate', 'complaint', 'offered', 'mr']","Image caption William Powell pictured during a debate in the SeneddLib Dem AM William Powell has been given a formal written warning after a young activist complained of his inappropriate behaviour, it has emerged.

Ruby Wax is 'Losing it' at the Edinburgh Fringe,Comedian Ruby Wax's Edinburgh Fringe show looks for laughs in the story of her mental illness.,"['Steven Brocklehurst', 'Bbc Scotland News Website']",None,"Image caption Ruby Wax has been touring the show around psychiatric hospitals

Ruby Wax is mentally ill.

""But at least I got a show out of it,"" she tells the audience with her trademark glibness.

Losing it, playing at the Underbelly during the Edinburgh Fringe, is Wax's examination of her own breakdown and her thoughts on what led her to it.

The 58-year-old maintains the hyperactive, self-centred, wisecracking persona which she developed over three decades in the spotlight but there is also a more honest and vulnerable Wax telling a personal story.

Wax shares the details of her own clinical depression and her trips to the Priory and confronts the stigma and shame of mental illness.

""The show is comedy,"" she says.

""It is hilarious. I don't talk about raising awareness but at one point I see the audience start nodding their heads and they are saying 'I got that too'.

""But you don't have to be mentally ill to get what I'm talking about.""

""I have always been interested in psychology,"" Wax says.

She studied the subject at the University of California at Berkeley before running away to Glasgow to study acting.

""Acting became a job and I always said 'at some time I am going to go back and study this'.""

It is like finding out you are not possessed by the devil Ruby Wax

She is currently studying for a Masters degree in ""mindfulness-based cognitive therapy"" at Oxford.

Wax says that understanding the way the brain functions takes the fear away.

""It is like finding out you are not possessed by the devil,"" she says.

During the show, she delivers a cod-lecture on the science of the brain.

Careful not to be too serious, she steers away from neuroscience but her message is clear.

""Mental illness is a disease like diabetes, it cannot just be wished away.""

Wax has been performing the show, alongside her friend Judith Owen, for more than a year in hospitals and psychiatric units.

She says performing in psychiatric hospitals is the ""biggest thrill"" but she wants to reach out to the ""lost tribe"" of sufferers and carers.

'Got it made'

""My people,"" as she calls them.

Wax and Owen, who plays piano and sings snatches of songs which try to encapsulate the feelings the comedian is describing, will take the show to London's West End after its Edinburgh run.

Wherever they go they hold forums which discuss mental health issues such as the effectiveness of drugs and also seek to put people in touch with help and support.

Later in the year, Wax will unveil a website called blackdogtribe.com.

Wax says the website will have chat rooms and it will be very visual because much of the mental health literature can be very hard to read.

She hopes it will create a mental health brand which is something like Alcoholic Anonymous, where people form a network of support for each other.

""Those alcoholics have got it made,"" she quips.

Molly Parkin: Fashioning her own career,"Molly Parkin speaks of her life as a fashion editor, painter, alcoholic and explains how her father's abuse affected her some 70 years later.","['Mario', 'Bbc News']",None,"Image caption Molly Parkin lives in sheltered accommodation in Chelsea but says she prefers it to her 51 previous homes

""It isn't what you've done that you regret, it's what you haven't done,"" says Molly Parkin.

Based on that premise, it must be rather hard for her to have any regrets at all.

Self-proclaimed national treasure, painter, former agony aunt, award-winning fashion editor, theatre performer, erotic author with a dizzying string of former lovers, this 78-year-old has detailed some of her exploits in a memoir, Welcome to Mollywood.

Her own motto for dressing is to rise each morning and ""throw on whatever's nearest, just as long as it clashes"" and it was this life-long extravagant style that led her to catch the eye of the fashion world.

It was searing, that experience of writing about [my abuse], so much so I had to have a bucket in order to vomit into as I wrote Molly Parkin

In 1964, faced with a lull in her painting career, she was courted by Nova magazine, becoming its fashion editor, before moving on to Harpers and Queen in 1967 and then the Sunday Times in 1969.

Voted fashion editor of the year in 1971, just one of several awards from the fashion world, she quit the industry soon after, turning down many high-profile offers to return elsewhere, leaving it behind forever.

""Fashion was never my world, it's a cruel and superficial world. I never liked it, I wasn't happy in it, although they lauded me with all the distinctions and awards. It wasn't a world I wanted to be in. It was a relief when I left it.""

Such was her unease with the fashion industry that she quit the first two editorial posts without any financial compensation, and worked without a contract at the Sunday Times. Her wayward dealings with money would come back to haunt her.

She was given a chunky, red plastic desk by the Sunday Times when she left, which she still uses now. The adjacent wall is covered with pictures of friends, family and David Beckham in his pants.

Image caption Molly was made fashion editor of the Sunday Times in 1969

Molly is brimming with gripping anecdotes of working with the great and good, but her experiences are underpinned by much darker elements, including her sexual abuse by her father, which she kept a secret until she was in her 60s.

The unflinching detail of her father's behaviour towards her as a child, which she describes in her book, makes for painful and uncomfortable reading, along with the physical beatings he often administered. It's a difficult process for both reader and author.

""It was searing, that experience of writing about it, so much so I had to have a bucket in order to vomit into as I wrote,"" she says.

""And even that physical exorcism of him was a healing process. The writing of this book has allowed me to come to total compassion and forgiveness for this man.""

She nimbly nips around her cluttered flat, mainly one large room in sheltered accommodation in London's Chelsea, where she has lived since going bankrupt several years ago, the latest of the 52 homes she has lived in as an adult.

The greatest movement now in fashion is Primark, because of the cheapness, although the place horrifies some people Molly Parkin

The place is full of large piles of books, paintings, ornaments, clothes, and all sorts of stuff, with shoes lurking and leaping out to trip any feet navigating the narrow walkways between it all.

She has covered everything in beautiful, if eye-watering, colourful throws, creating richly-explosive mounds all over the small space. It's rather like being inside a melted rainbow.

As she makes a herbal tea in her tiny kitchen, she introduces a large Madonna, two Buddhas and some other religious artefacts, in what she describes as her ""spiritual corner"".

Born in the mining village of Pontycymmer, south Wales, in 1932, she talks of once living in mansions, being showered in gifts by rich lovers, including a vintage Rolls Royce from the year of her birth, bestowed by ""a besotted aristo"".

But all that has now gone, her boutique on the King's Road in Chelsea and her Belgravia restaurant merely distant memories. But at least she managed to conquer the demons of her drinking.

""I used to go to three Alcohol Anonymous meetings a day, just to keep out of the bars,"" she says, now dry for the past 24 years.

She also puts her many fiancees partly down to her alcoholic haze.

""I don't know whatever made people think I'd make good wife material, or that their mothers would like me. They would always invite me over for tea, and then I wouldn't hear from that boy again,"" she chuckles.

Image caption Molly (right) is seen here in her Chelsea art studio in 1961

""I did sit down and started to count the fiancees I'd had. I got to 18 and I thought 'Oh, stop it Moll'.

""You must remember I was a boozer, darling. At the end of the second date - sometimes the first - the person would say 'I'm passionately in love with you Molly, will you marry me?'

""Because I was drunk I'd say: 'That sounds fun.'""

And what of modern fashion? After working with photoshoot budgets that warranted security guards to watch over the precious gems she'd ordered from Bond Street jewellers, what catches her eye now?

""I don't see anything enthralling in the fashion reportage now, not as I did, breaking new ground.

""I like to see fashion seeping all down to youngsters. The greatest movement now in fashion is Primark, because of the cheapness, although the place horrifies some people.""

She also extols the virtues of street markets and buying from charity shops, whose clothes she cuts up to make her own garments, ""because you're helping charities and I like the concept of that.""

She adds: ""I am a humanitarian.

Stafford bishop accuses government over alcohol abuse,"The Bishop of Stafford hits out at the government for ""doing little"" to address the problem of alcohol abuse.",[],None,"Image caption In January, ministers unveiled plans to set a minimum price for alcohol in England and Wales.

The Bishop of Stafford has criticised the government for ""doing little"" to prevent alcohol abuse.

The Rt Rev Geoff Annas has described alcohol misuse as ""one of the major sins of our time"".

Writing in a pastoral letter, published in parish magazines across the Diocese of Lichfield, he called for a ""seismic shift"" in attitudes towards drinking.

The government has said it is tackling alcohol-related crime ""at its source"" through a variety of measures.

He said charities were left to tackle the effects of ""this drug abuse"", with government action not going far enough.

'Major sin'

In January, ministers unveiled plans to set a minimum price for alcohol in England and Wales.

They said banning shops and bars from selling drinks for less than the tax paid on them would cut crime and set a ""base price"" for the first time.

It works out at 38p for a can of weak lager and £10.71 for a litre of vodka.

In the letter, Mr Annas said: ""One definition of 'sin' is anything that comes between us and God and makes us less than the person God created us to be.

""Alcohol abuse is one of the major 'sins' of our time - and it is one that governments do very little to prevent.

""Instead, it is left to amazing organisations like Alcoholics Anonymous or in the inspirational O'Connor Gateway Charitable Trust, of which I am proud to be a trustee, to tackle the effects of this drug abuse.""

'Drink at home'

""Binge-drinking"" was not the fault of pub and nightclub owners, he said, nor was it down to an extension in opening hours.

""The extension of the licensing laws means that they can stay open later but in reality many [people] now do not even arrive until 11 at night,"" said Mr Annas.

""Prior to this they drink in their own homes, consuming alcohol which they have purchased very cheaply in their local supermarket or corner shop.

""The government has introduced minimum pricing but the level it has been set is derisory.""

A Home Office spokesman said the government was tackling alcohol related crime at its source by taking tough action against irresponsible premises, giving communities a chance to have a say over licensing and allowing councils to charge more for late licences.

""And we haven't just stood by while suppliers let drink be sold so cheaply that it leads to drunken violence, we've taken steps to ensure that by the end of the year the sale of alcohol below cost is banned,"" the spokesman said.","['stafford', 'alcohol', 'tackle', 'crime', 'abuse', 'bishop', 'tackling', 'unveiled', 'accuses', 'source', 'spokesman', 'minimum', 'set', 'price']","Image caption In January, ministers unveiled plans to set a minimum price for alcohol in England and Wales.

A witness has told the Jersey care inquiry she was fostered in the 1970s by an alcoholic who ""emotionally abused"" her.

Giving evidence anonymously, Miss B said she was now surprised the 13-year placement was allowed.

A neighbour worked for children's services and knew the foster mother drank heavily, she said.

Miss B said her own son is now in foster care but children's services is much better nowadays.

My foster mum was an alcoholic and I believe her behaviour towards me amounted to emotional abuse Miss B, Care inquiry witness

Now in her 40s, the woman was fostered at the age of three when her real mother, then aged 17, was ""railroaded"" into giving her up.

'Emotionally abusive'

She said her 13 years with the foster family had been unhappy and caused her to miss out on her real family's lives.

Her foster mother was ""emotionally abusive"", said Miss B, although she was very close to her foster father, who made breakfast and got the children ready for school.

She never experienced physical abuse but said her foster mother favoured her adopted foster brother, imposed a strict Catholic lifestyle and bad-mouthed her real family.

The woman told the inquiry the experience had left her without the emotional and practical skills to properly look after her own children, one of whom is now in care.

She said social workers' interventions with her own son were much more positive than when she was in care.

""My foster mum was an alcoholic and I believe her behaviour towards me amounted to emotional abuse,"" said Miss B.

""I believe that my life has been messed up as a result. I've always felt quite immature and attention-seeking. I never learned any life skills.

""If I had the right foster parents, if it had been somebody else, I think I could have learned from a proper family set up.""

"El secreto del éxito de Alcohólicos Anónimos para recuperar adictos ""en 12 pasos""","Se cumplen 80 años de la fundación de Alcohólicos Anónimos, que propuso un modelo de tratamiento de las adicciones luego copiado muchas veces en todo el mundo. Pero el programa es también objeto de críticas sostenidas.",['Bbc Mundo'],6/15/2015 0:00,"Derechos de autor de la imagen HBO Image caption Una reunión de AA en la serie Los Soprano de HBO.

Se cumplen 80 años desde la fundación Alcohólicos Anónimos y, desde entonces, se han creado miles de grupos que copian su método para tratar distintas formas de adicción. Chris Stokel-Walker explora cuál es el secreto del éxito del ""sólo por hoy"".

""Mi nombre es Pedro y soy un alcohólico"".

Es una frase que suena familiar incluso para aquellos que nunca han asistido a una reunión de Alcohólicos Anónimos (AA).

Pedro se presenta así ante los otros 40 concurrentes a la reunión, que tiene lugar una mañana de domingo en una pequeña sala cerca de la principal calle comercial de Newcastle, en el norte de Inglaterra.

La respuesta es una bienvenida al unísono, cálida y entusiasta: ""Hola, Pedro"".

Quienes están aquí tienen algo en común: su dependencia del alcohol. Aunque vienen de diferentes sectores de la sociedad y tienen distintas ocupaciones e historias de vida.

Derechos de autor de la imagen AP Image caption AA se creó hace 80 años.

El formato de la reunión es simple: una presentación, una lectura, el testimonio de un miembro, luego una discusión abierta en la que cualquiera de los presentes puede compartir sus preocupaciones, sus logros o sus pensamientos.

Pedro empezó a tomar a los 11 años. ""Para cuando tuve la edad en que se puede empezar a beber legalmente, yo ya era un visitante habitual de los centros de tratamiento de alcoholismo, iba una y otra vez al médico, una y otra vez me llevaban arrestado a la estación de policía"".

Ahora, Pedro lleva 34 años sin probar el alcohol y atribuye su sobriedad sostenida a su participación en AA.

Los 12 pasos

Todos los miembros mencionan el ""proceso de transitar por los 12 pasos"" como uno de los pilares del programa de AA.

El primero de esos pasos, publicado cuatro años después de la fundación de la entidad, dice: ""Admitimos que éramos impotentes ante el alcohol, que nuestras vidas se habían vuelto ingobernables"".

Derechos de autor de la imagen Narcotics Anonymous Image caption El programa de recuperación de los 12 pasos de Narcóticos Anónimos es el mismo que el de AA.

Los 12 pasos son, en pocas palabras, un plan de recuperación para lograr superar la adicción.

Ese plan incluye la sumisión ante un poder espiritual superior, el reconocimiento del alcoholismo como un problema que no tiene final, la reparación de los daños causados a las personas afectadas por la adicción y un despertar espiritual a través de la oración o la meditación. (Vea la descripción detallada de cada uno de los pasos al final de este artículo).

Fundado por Bill Wilson y Bob Smith en Akron, en el estado de Ohio, AA se desprendió de una organización cristiana estadounidense, llamada The Grupo Oxford.

El grupo celebra este año el 80º aniversario del momento en que Wilson ayudó a Smith a salir del alcoholismo: el 10 de junio de 1935 fue la fecha de su último trago.

Ese elemento social de AA, la importancia del ""sponsor"" o padrino del adicto, es tan conocido como sus 12 pasos.

A la fecha, hay 115.326 grupos afiliados a AA en 175 países, según las más recientes estimaciones de la entidad. Sólo en Estados Unidos hay 60.143.

De acuerdo a un estudio de 1998, 90% de los centros de tratamiento de adicciones privados se basa en el modelo estadounidense de los 12 pasos.

A cada adicción, su grupo

Y los principios han sentado las bases para otros grupos que no tienen vínculos directos con AA.

Entre ellos, Narcóticos Anónimos, el más específico Marihuana Anónimos, Jugadores Anónimos, incluso grupos para adictos al trabajo o el sexo.

Además de los más conocidos para tratar la adicción a la comida, hay otros para quienes sufren el trastorno de acumulación o para quienes tienen una inhabilidad patológica ""para cubrir sus propias necesidades materiales"". Y para los parientes preocupados por quienes sufren adicciones de toda clase, bajo el rótulo Familias Anónimas.

En algunos pueblos pequeños donde no hay grupos dedicados a un trastorno específico se alienta a los pacientes a que concurran a otra reunión de adictos, así sea de otra clase: que los adictos al juego busquen apoyo en una sesión de alcohólicos, por ejemplo.

""Si uno mira el programa de los 12 pasos, la única diferencia realmente se da en la primera parte del primer paso. El resto del programa es un proyecto para la vida"", dice Pedro.

""Los 12 pasos (de AA) son muy aplicables a cualquier otra adicción"", confirma Amy Krentzman, de la Escuela de Trabajo Social de la Universidad de Minnesota, que ha hecho investigación sobre AA y otros programas basados.

""Modifican el lenguaje, pero la lógica es la misma… y tienen el respaldo de otra gente que ya ha transitado esos 12 pasos y ha alcanzado el éxito, lo cual es alentador"".

La mayoría de los grupos ofrecen sesiones por Skype, donde la disponibilidad es de 24 horas. ""Ahí hay compañeros siempre dispuestos a escuchar y uno dice lo de siempre, 'Mi nombre es tal y soy adicto a tal cosa'"", apunta el coordinador.

La teoría del ayudante

Parte del éxito de estas instituciones se apoya también en la llamada teoría del ayudante, acuñada en los años 60.

Según Krentzman, contar con una persona destinada a asistir al adicto de manera directa suele ser beneficioso para ambos: da al padrino una sensación de bienestar, que ayuda en su propio proceso dado que muchos de ellos son también adictos en recuperación.

Muchas películas y series de TV, de ""The Sopranos"" a ""Mad Men"", ""House of Cards"" o ""The West Wing"", retratan la relación entre el adicto y su sponsor. Muchas veces, los primeros reciben apoyo emocional y espiritual, además de la guía práctica, de parte de sus padrinos.

El otro principio es que AA considera el tratamiento como un proceso continuo, que nunca termina. Y que se aborda de un día a la vez: la meta es ir pasando las tentaciones de a 24 horas, ponerse por meta el día siguiente.

Esto lo diferencia de otros abordajes a la adicción que ofrecen programas cortos y luego dejan al adicto hacer frente a su vida cotidiana sin mayor acompañamiento.

Marihuana Anónimos tiene ""exactamente el mismo formato"", dice Thomas, un miembro del grupo. ""Tiene los 12 pasos y varias historias que demuestran la aplicación práctica de esos pasos, de gente que ha pasado por la experiencia y se ha mantenido sobrio desde entonces"".

No es para todos

Pero estos grupos que siguen la propuesta de AA no cuentan con el apoyo de la organización central, que se maneja a través de Alcoholics Anonymous World Services (AAWS), dueña de los derechos de autor.

AAWS sí otorga permiso para el uso de los 12 pasos.

Y los principios tienen sus detractores, claro está. Muchos critican el elemento cuasi religioso, otros el énfasis en la abstinencia absoluta más que la opción de un consumo moderado y controlado.

Lea: ¿Qué es peor: un par de copas diarias o una gran borrachera los fines de semana?

Un filme, titulado ""The 13th Step"", denunció supuestos casos de abuso sexual cometidos por integrantes de AA que tuvieron por víctimas a adictos asistentes a las reuniones.

Pero tal vez la mayor crítica proviene de quienes quieren evidencia concreta de que este programa ampliamente aceptado alcanza resultados reales.

""La evidencia muestra que funciona muy bien para algunas personas"", dice Krentzman.

Una revisión de todos los estudios científicos que se han hecho sobre la tasa de éxito de AA, publicada en 2006, encontró que ""ningún estudio experimental demostró de manera unívoca la eficacia de AA"".

Lance Dodes, un especialista en abuso de sustancias, escribió en un libro sobre los 12 pasos: ""Alcohólicos Anónimos fue proclamado el tratamiento correcto contra el alcoholismo hace 75 años, pese a la falta de evidencia científica sobre la eficacia de su método y desde entonces hemos seguido sosteniéndolo como válido"".

¿Toda adicción es enfermedad?

Otro foco contencioso es que el traslado del programa de 12 pasos a otras áreas da legitimidad social a la idea de que una amplia gama de compulsiones representan enfermedades.

Derechos de autor de la imagen Getty Image caption El programa de AA se ha usado desde hace 80 años, pero no hay evidencia científica de su efectividad.

Los científicos continúan divididos sobre si la adicción a la comida realmente existe. Discuten si la adicción al sexo es real o no – de hecho, no aparece mencionada en la lista de desórdenes y trastornos mentales de la Asociación Estadounidense de Psiquiatría.

Pero, para muchos, el programa es efectivo. ""Funciona por un proceso psicológico, uno espiritual y uno social"", detalla Krentzman. ""Por la manera en que da un sentido de comunidad a la gente, por el hecho de saber que otros sufren lo mismo que tú"".

Esto es algo en lo que coincide Jennifer, que asiste a Overeaters Anonymous, para el tratamiento del sobrepeso.

Se unió al grupo en 2008, cuando tenía 37 años y pesaba casi 114 kilos. Hoy, con varios kilos menos, atribuye parte del éxito a su relación sostenida con otros compañeros del grupo.

""Las veces que he ido a terapia siempre tenía la sensación de que me daban consejos para probar pero no tenían experiencia de primera mano. Hay algo auténtico en esto de tener a un adicto ayudando a otro adicto"".

""Es un programa muy simple para gente con complicaciones. Que resiste críticas de adentro y de afuera (de la organización), lo que no se puede decir de muchas otras filosofías de rehabilitación de adicciones"", agrega Thomas.

En la reunión de domingo en Newcastle, los 40 asistentes se sientan, escuchan y cuentan historias de adicción. Hay apretones de mano y conversaciones amigables, compasión, sonrisas y bromas compartidas.

Uno a uno van saliendo cuando termina la cita: salen a la calle, se mezclan con los muchos transeúntes y sus bolsas de compras y se ven como uno más en la multitud. Pero en sus mentes llevan un peso extra: el del compromiso en 12 pasos, que los acompañará hasta que toque renovarlo la próxima semana. Una semana a la vez.

Los 12 pasos de AA

Admitimos que éramos impotentes ante el alcohol y que nuestras vidas se habían vuelto ingobernables. Llegamos a creer que un Poder superior a nosotros podría devolvernos el sano juicio. Resolvimos confiar nuestra voluntad y nuestra vida al cuidado de Dios, según nuestro propio entendimiento de Él. Sin temor, hicimos un sincero y minucioso examen de conciencia. Admitimos ante Dios, ante nosotros mismos y ante otro ser humano la naturaleza exacta de nuestras faltas. Estuvimos enteramente dispuestos a que Dios eliminase todos estos defectos de carácter. Pedimos a Dios humildemente que nos librase de nuestras culpas. Hicimos una lista de todas las personas a quienes habíamos perjudicado, y estuvimos dispuestos a reparar el mal que les ocasionamos. Reparamos directamente el mal causado a esas personas cuando nos fue posible, excepto en los casos en que el hacerlo les hubiese infligido más daño o perjudicado a un tercero. Proseguimos con nuestro examen de conciencia, admitiendo espontáneamente nuestras faltas al momento de reconocerlas. Mediante la oración y la meditación, tratamos de mejorar nuestro contacto consciente con Dios y le pedimos tan sólo la capacidad para reconocer su voluntad y las fuerzas para cumplirla. Habiendo logrado un despertar espiritual como resultado de estos pasos, tratamos de llevar este mensaje a otras personas y practicar estos principios en todas nuestras acciones.

On the trail of George Orwell’s outcasts,"Retracing Orwell's footsteps, Emma Jane Kirby finds the hallmarks of poverty he identified - addiction, exhaustion and, often, a quiet dignity - are as apparent now as they were 80 years ago.","['Emma Jane Kirby', 'Bbc News', 'Paris']",None,"Image copyright Other Image caption Orwell's narration begins in the street he called the Rue du Coq d'Or, in the 5th Arrondissement, where he once lived

Some 80 years after George Orwell chronicled the lives of the hard-up and destitute in his book Down and Out in Paris and London, what has changed? Retracing the writer's footsteps, Emma Jane Kirby finds the hallmarks of poverty identified by Orwell - addiction, exhaustion and, often, a quiet dignity - are as apparent now as they were then.

""Quarrels, and the desolate cries of street hawkers, and the shouts of children chasing-orange-peel over the cobbles, and at night loud singing and the sour reek of the refuse carts, made up the atmosphere of the street…. Poverty is what I'm writing about and I had my first contact with poverty in this slum.""

Image copyright bbc 'Tomber dans la misere' (falling into misery), is the phrase she whispers most and I notice her breath is sour like someone who diets or skips meals Emma Jane Kirby

Such was George Orwell's recollection of what he called the Rue du Coq d'Or in Paris, 1929 - the real-life Rue du Pot de Fer. Today it's pleasure rather than poverty that defines the Latin Quarter that Orwell frequented 80-odd years ago. The chic pavement cafes are full of contented-looking people leisurely sipping their vin rose, and the air is perfumed by the sweet smell of crepes and tourists' money.

But poverty hasn't left Paris - she's simply changed address. She may not look quite the same as she did in the 1920s but if Orwell were to meet her again on these streets, he'd know her straight away. And I doubt he'd find her greatly changed...

Poverty came knocking on Claudine's door five years ago when she was made redundant. She leans in close to me as she talks, her right hand often rising to her mouth as if it wants to censor the words that her lips keep forming. ""Tomber dans la misere"" (falling into misery), is the phrase she whispers most and I notice her breath is sour like someone who diets or skips meals.

""We don't eat lunch,"" she tells me. ""It's just my little way of economising."" She nods down to her bulging shopping caddy. ""It's enough for my family's dinner,"" she says, ""but not enough for two meals a day.""

Shame

Claudine and I are sitting in a big warehouse in the north of Paris, which serves as a food distribution centre for the city's chronically poor. It reminds me of the sort of indoor market you find in the less salubrious quarters of former Soviet states - mountains of unbranded pasta and rice piled on tables, misshapen, anaemic-looking vegetables wilting in crates, biscuits and chocolate wrapped in such bland, stark white paper, that not even a child could be excited by its contents.

We watch the steady line of people, Europeans, Maghrebians and West Africans, methodically trudging from table to table, collecting their rations and stuffing them quickly into a pram hood or caddy. Despite the animated cheerfulness of the staff, I notice not one of the customers meets their eye as they take the food parcels.

Shame, Claudine - who is French - tells me, is what links everyone here. She's told no-one that her weekly shop is a hand-out and she doubts anyone else here has admitted it either.

The secrecy that's attached to poverty is one of the first things that struck Orwell.

""From the start,"" he wrote, ""it tangles you in a net of lies and even with the lies you can hardly manage it.""

Orwell the down and out Image copyright Getty Images Orwell was born Eric Arthur Blair on 25 June 1903 in eastern India, the son of a British colonial civil servant. He was educated in England and, after he left Eton, joined the Indian Imperial Police in Burma, then a British colony. He resigned in 1927 and decided to become a writer. In 1928, he moved to Paris where lack of success as a writer forced him into a series of menial jobs. He described his experiences in his first book, Down and Out in Paris and London, published in 1933. In Paris, he washed dishes at the overpriced ""Hotel X"", in a filthy, hot kitchen. He met ""eccentric people - people who have fallen into solitary, half-mad grooves of life and given up trying to be normal or decent"".

Milly is fighting poverty with a fierce, indignant energy. A bilingual secretary from Cameroon, she is immaculately dressed and has the practised deportment of a society debutante.

In the drop-in centre where I meet her, she looks decidedly out of place next to the dusty, weary figures that are slumped beside her. Appearances, she tells me, are everything if one is to cling on to one's dignity. She agrees to talk to me but only in a private room so that the other people here won't realise that her situation is as bad as theirs. When the door closes she tells me that she's homeless and last night she slept on a veranda.

Milly is facing deportation. She came here legally but after she fell ill and had to stop working, her carte de sejour - the papers that allow her to stay and work in France - were revoked. She admits that she is homesick but is terrified to return to Cameroon empty-handed. I ask her if her family know she's homeless and she throws her hands up in the air and rolls her eyes in horror.

""It would kill them,"" she tells me. ""They would drop down dead with shame.""

Aching all over

When I meet Modi from Mali, he looks as if he might drop down dead with fatigue. Like Orwell, Modi is a plongeur, a washer-upper in a big restaurant and he works six days a week, 12 hours a day cleaning pots and pans.

When we talk in the bar of a neighbouring restaurant, his head keeps drooping onto his folded arms and it seems to be such an effort for him to articulate his words that he either slurs them all together in a gluey, glottal jumble, or shoots out small phrases in tiny bursts of energy that fizzle out before the last word has been formed.

Orwell complained that when working as a plongeur he felt as if his back were broken and his head ""filled with hot cinders"". Modi agrees that he aches all over and at the end of the day he cannot feel his feet.

Because rent in Paris is too expensive, he lives an hour's train ride outside the city. Although after midnight the trains are slower so it takes two hours for Modi to get home. He gets up at 0700 and gets to bed at 0200. Most plongeurs in Paris these days are either Pakistani or West African. I stop asking myself why that is, when Modi tells me how much he is paid - just under 4 euros (£3.50) an hour. He's working, of course, ""on the black"".

""The last time I had a night out,"" he says flicking through a virtual diary in his brain, ""was... last year.""

Madame Jolivet can have as many nights out with friends as she wants to - her problem is she's not allowed to have any nights in with them.

Image copyright Other Image caption Madame Jolivet's tiny B&B room costs 1,730 euros a month

The rules of her B&B state clearly that visitors are not permitted, but I have managed to frighten the landlady into admitting me by pretending to be an official from the local authority. Now I'm standing (albeit slightly stooped) in her fusty-smelling attic apartment.

I am Madame Jolivet's first visitor in six years and she is laughing hysterically at having won this tiny victory over her hated landlady. I tell her that in Orwell's day, the residents in his filthy hotel used to yell ""Vache! Salope!"" (""Cow! Bitch!"") at their landlady, and Madame Jolivet doubles up with mirth as she mimes the insults at the sky-light. Then, quite suddenly, she looks sick with fear and switches the TV on at a high volume, motioning to the door and telling me the landlady is probably listening at it. She's right. We hear her tread softly back down the stairs.

Orwell's hotel room was infested with bugs - Madame Jolivet's is infested with mice. She's tormented by their scratching at night. She's caught them on camera during the day, and once she found one in her fridge. She complained to the landlady who warned her that if she mentions it again, she'll kick her out - after all, she's already been warned that her daughter's voice is too loud.

Madame Jolivet is a large lady and she squeezes herself round the tiny space of her apartment. When she's at the sink she's jammed between the bed and the table, her body painfully curved sideways to avoid smacking her head on the sloped ceiling. The landlady charges 1,730 euros (£1,500) a month for this space which she rents out as a 16 sq m apartment. Recently the police did a spot check on Madame Jolivet's apartment and recorded the actual habitable surface area as just 5 sq m - that's the size of about six or seven beach towels.

Madame Jolivet lives here with her grown-up son and daughter. Until last year her other daughter lived with them, too, but she tried to kill herself twice and is now in psychiatric care.

Although it's miles from the hostel where she's staying tonight, Milly, the dignified lady from Cameroon offers to come with me in the taxi to the Gare du Nord where I'm catching my train home to London to make my next step of Orwell's journey.

""In my country,"" she smiles, ""we never let a traveller start a journey alone.""

She's very jolly in the cab, reminiscing about her family, her sister in London, the present she sent her nephew in America last year. By the time we get to the Eurostar terminal I've completely forgotten that Milly's homeless and I realise with a real physical shock that this is exactly what she wanted, that she wanted me to see her as she was before poverty possessed her - a very proper, very animated, valuable woman.

She waves me off, her whole body swaying into the gesture, in that exaggerated way that small children say goodbye. Each time I turn, she's still there, both arms in the air, her head following the rhythm.

Sitting in my seat on the train, my eyes closed, I can see her still. The last line from a Stevie Smith poem comes into my head:

Not Waving but Drowning...

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Orwell closely studied the tramps of London

""There exists in our minds,"" wrote Orwell, ""a sort of ideal or typical tramp - a repulsive, rather dangerous creature, who would die rather than work or wash, and wants nothing but to beg, drink and rob hen-houses... I am not saying, of course, that most tramps are ideal characters; I am only saying that they are ordinary human beings, and that if they are worse than other people it is the result and not the cause of their way of life.""

Five minutes inside the soup-kitchen in Hackney, east London, and I immediately understand what Orwell meant - that the ""typical tramp"" does not exist.

The ""service-users"" - as the volunteers here call them - are a truly disparate group - some look as if they've just stepped off the tube after a busy day at work, others are unkempt and smell feral. Some are evidently fighting a losing battle with drugs and alcohol, while others look more in keeping with an old folks' home.

A well-spoken woman who is far more elegantly dressed than I am, and whom I take to be a doctor, confides in me her concerns about the well-being of a schizophrenic service-user she recently escorted to hospital. She then confounds me by sitting down to eat the free meal. A man with a carefully oiled black quiff is introduced to me by a grinning volunteer as Shakin' Stevens. I smile conspiratorially with him at Shaky's delusions and am later told by the service manager that the volunteer, himself, is delusional and has been coming here to eat each week for years.

Image copyright bbc Image caption Today's 'down and outs' are known as 'service-users'

Misfits

What was it that Orwell said? ""Change places and handy dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief?""

I am instantly struck by the civility of the meal time. A tattooed and very inebriated punk knocks over an elderly lady's walking frame as he staggers to find a free seat. He apologises, asks if the seat beside her is taken and then appears to engage her in polite conversation. When he is served a plate of Mediterranean vegetable pasta by the charming French chef, he thanks her profusely and leaning towards the Polish man opposite him asks if he would kindly pass the salt?

As I pour tea and coffee, an emaciated black man in a filthy sweatshirt shakes my hand warmly and asks me how I'm doing today? Society's misfits, fitting in.

So that's what you think is it? I'm just yet another homeless drunk? Grant

It's here I meet Stuart, who is currently on a methadone programme and who has serious mental health problems. Physically abused by his father, Stuart was put into care in the North East of England, where he claims he was then systematically sexually abused until he gathered the courage to run away to London at the age of 15.

Aside from a brief respite of a year or two when he had a council flat, the London streets have been the only home he's known. He is now 40. I ask him to tell me what he remembers about those early years sleeping rough.

He doesn't miss a beat before replying, ""Crack, heroin, begging, robbing, stealing and mugging"". An entire life, reduced into just six words.

Grant on the other hand can talk the hind legs off a donkey but he prefers to steer clear of personal details, claiming there are many people worse off than him.

He zooms through his life story with a dismissive wave of his hand - adopted, never held down a relationship, used to work in social care, lost his job, lives in a hostel, spent a long time in hospital after being brutally attacked on the street.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Orwell did the rounds of the night shelters and soup kitchens of London

He leaves out the part about his fairly evident problems with alcohol and when, three weeks into our acquaintance, I ask him about that side of his life he snarls defensively, ""So that's what you think is it? I'm just yet another homeless drunk?""

Grant is articulate and funny. He's wary and prickly, yet sensitive and compassionate.

He likes Orwell but prefers Jack London. When my questions become woolly, he pulls me up for being unfocused and he is constantly re-assessing and re-evaluating his own beliefs and opinions. Twice after our meetings he has sent me text messages, apologising for sounding grumpy. When we talk late in the evening, he suddenly checks his watch and becomes concerned about how I'm going to get home to the other side of London. When I ask what keeps him going in life, he gestures towards the volunteers who are clearing up the kitchen.

""Belief in your fellow man's goodness,"" he says. ""Because by and large people are good, aren't they?""

Recession

Orwell always defended tramps' reputation as ""drunks"", pointing out that none of the tramps he knew had any money with which to buy beer. But today alcohol is cheap and features heavily in the lives of many of those on the streets. Not least in the lives of the many Poles who came to seek their fortunes as labourers in the UK when the borders opened in 2004.

When the recession bit and the building sites closed, they had limited access to benefits and quickly found themselves homeless. The volunteers in many of the drop-in centres and soup kitchens I visit in London tell me that around a good third or even half of their service-users are now Polish. As one careworker put it, they're ""Orwell's latter-day Irish tramp"" - Catholic, slightly on the fringe of the London homeless community, and plagued with a ""great thirst"".

London Image copyright Getty Images In London, the narrator lives as a tramp, stopping off in a variety of accommodation - lodging houses, tramps' hostels and Salvation Army shelters. He meets a number of characters, including Bozo, a pavement artist, storyteller and philosopher, who is adept in the technique of begging. One chapter is devoted to the fine points of London guttersnipe slang.

Zibbi, who's in his early 40s came to the UK seven years ago, where he got work in a salad factory in Peterborough. For nine months life was ""good-good"", he tells me in his broken English.

""Good-good, because Zibbi is good and Zibbi no drink.""

Zibbi refers to himself almost entirely in the third person, as if while talking to me, he has stepped outside of himself and has become a detached observer, albeit with an anthropological curiosity in his own behaviour.

""Do Zibbi drink today?"" he asks me.

By the look - and smell of Zibbi - he does little else but drink these days. His face has bloated and taken on the colour of ripe plums, his hands shake and the sharp stench of pure alcohol from his breath overpowers even the acrid, vinegary smell of his clothes and the odour of hot grease from his recent fried breakfast, which still hangs in fat little globules in his beard and moustache.

He shakes his head. ""Oh, lady,"" he says, ""Zibbi drink not a little drink, Zibbi drink and drink. He drink vodka til…"" (he makes a gesture of passing out). ""Until bang and bye bye. Game over.""

Zibbi blames the heavy drinking culture of his country for his weakness and claims his cousin, Miro, is the worst influence on him, egging him on to have just one more. Frequently he seems to set himself on stage, theatrically acting out imagined dialogue he has with Miro and with his disgusted family. It's like watching a medieval morality play, with the forces of Good and Evil battling for power.

I've thought about [my situation] so many times on the streets - especially when I'm alone, but no-one really asked me before... I feel strengthless and hopeless Mikael

The drop-in centre has set Zibbi up with an alcohol adviser who is trying to help him cut down his alcohol consumption. He talks about her in hallowed terms, and when he whispers her name ""Karen"", he lifts his hands and face to heaven. I suspect she's the only woman he has regular contact with. When I meet Karen later she tells me that she's trying to wean Zibbi off calling her ""Mummy"".

I ask Zibbi what he thinks of himself and he looks startled. ""Me? Zibbi?"" he asks uncertainly and his eyes become confused as if he's struggling to connect the alcoholic Zibbi character with the man who speaks his words.

""I… I… I don't know,"" he stutters. He hangs his head and slumps in his chair.

""So tired lady. I… I…""

'Not needed'

Zibbi becomes distressed as he fruitlessly searches for words which might join his isolated personal pronoun and we stop the interview. I realise he has totally lost his sense of self.

A few miles east in Hackney, and Mikael, a young, good-looking Pole in his late 20s, has also lost his identity - or at least his identity papers. Someone stole them one night a few months back when he'd blacked out in a vodka-induced stupor. Mikael is so softly spoken that he's barely audible at times. He tells me that talking to me is like going to Confession.

""I've thought about it [my situation] so many times on the streets,"" he says. ""Especially when I'm alone, but no-one really asked me before... I feel strengthless and hopeless.""

Mikael underestimates himself. A bright man and a fluent English speaker, he's enrolled in an Alcoholics Anonymous programme and, in a bid to stay on track, has made the very difficult decision to eschew the company of his fellow Poles and all other rough sleepers. He is still on the streets but unlike Zibbi, he is wearing freshly laundered clothes and looks fit and fairly healthy. He may not smell of alcohol but he reeks of loneliness.

Seven years ago, life was very different for Mikael. He had a legal, well-paid job as a labourer, he had a fiancee, a studio-flat and a gym membership. There were holidays, cinema trips, football matches - there was, as Mikael puts, it a time when he was ""really connected to society… and there was a future"". Then his boss sold his business and moved overseas. Mikael began drinking heavily, lost his studio and his girlfriend. I ask him what he misses most about his old life, fully expecting him to say the obvious things - a hot shower, a comfortable bed, his own food. But Mikael says something quite different.

""I feel like I'm not needed by this world. Like nobody needs me,"" he says quietly. ""I miss my girlfriend because I felt then someone needed me. And I felt needed in terms of work.""

The evil of poverty, wrote Orwell, is not so much that it makes a man suffer as that it rots him physically and spiritually. Work, he insisted, is the only thing to turn a half-alive vagrant into a self-respecting human being.

Mikael is desperate to find a job believing that work is the yellow brick road which will lead him ""to come back to the normal life,"" as he puts it. Although he admits that it's hard to keep motivated when you wake up cold, wet and shattered from a disturbed night in a shop doorway.

Mikael's progress is sporadic. He has long spells when he's free of alcohol and then sudden lapses which infuriate him and provoke tirades of self hatred, especially when he imagines what his family back home in Poland would say if they knew he was on the streets.

I return to the soup kitchen three weeks later confident of meeting Mikael again but worryingly, he doesn't turn up. I think of the boyish shyness which passed across his face when he had told me that sometimes when he was very lonely he talked to God. The prayer he recited was always the same:

""Hello God - I hope you still remember me and keep some faith in me.""

At the end of Down and Out in Paris and London, George Orwell asks himself what he's learnt from his experiences on the streets and in deference to the great man I shall ask myself the same question. I have learnt how quickly the dry rot of poverty stultifies and festers, crumbling confidence and destroying dignity.

I have seen how poverty marginalises, separates and ridicules. And I have understood that the chief cruelty of homelessness is that it doesn't dull the sensibilities of the man sleeping in the doorway but rather spitefully heightens them, forcing upon him so many cavernous hours in which he can burn with shame, ache with loneliness and cry for his mother.

Perhaps Mikael sums it up for everyone I have met both in Paris and London when he says, ""You know it's so easy to lose everything. But it's so, so tough to get it back.""","['zibbi', 'orwells', 'orwell', 'paris', 'poverty', 'outcasts', 'mikael', 'george', 'tells', 'shes', 'im', 'trail', 'life', 'london']","Poverty is what I'm writing about and I had my first contact with poverty in this slum.""
But poverty hasn't left Paris - she's simply changed address.
He described his experiences in his first book, Down and Out in Paris and London, published in 1933.
When the door closes she tells me that she's homeless and last night she slept on a veranda.

Former footballer jailed after 'bust up' in KFC,"A former Dundee and Arbroath footballer has been jailed for two years after a 'bust up' in a restaurant, while in possession of a knife.",[],None,"Image caption John Carling, a former Dundee and Arbroath football player was jailed at Dundee Sheriff Court.

A former footballer was jailed for two years after being arrested while drunk and in possession of a knife.

John Carling was arrested by police after a ""bust up"" in a KFC restaurant in Dundee.

When taken to police headquarters he was found to be in possession of a lock knife, hidden in his pocket.

The 38-year-old, who holds an MBA degree, was a footballer for both Dundee and Arbroath.

Fiscal depute Nicola Gillespie told Dundee Sheriff Court that Carling was now an unemployed alcoholic reliant on state benefits.

She said: ""At 19:35 on 11 May police received an anonymous call that there was somebody within KFC in High Street that appeared to be under the influence of alcohol, so much so that police were called.

""Officers traced the accused within the premises and he was taken outside.

""He was physically swaying and smelled very strongly of alcohol.

""His demeanour was generally aggressive.""

The court heard how Carling had been taken to the station and asked if he was in possession of any sharp items.

After Carling confirmed that he was, he was searched and officers found the silver lock knife with a seven centimetre blade within his inner left suit jacket pocket.

Ms Gillespie added: ""In relation to possessing the knife he said 'I bought that knife yesterday - I planned to go hunting with it'.""

Breached bail

Carling, of Dundee, pleaded guilty on indictment to possessing a lock knife and breaching bail on 11 May.

He further admitted additional charges of drink driving, twice breaching bail and breaching a community payback order, and was earlier convicted of a charge of being drunk in charge of a car.

Defence solicitor George Donnelly said: ""He was once a professional sportsman - this has been a spectacular fall from grace.

""His football career was cut short by injury but he went on to tertiary education, got an MBA and set up a successful business.

""That business involved a lot of socialising and glad-handing.

""Matters began to fall apart in 2008 when his marriage foundered, and now his liberty has been lost.""

Disregarded opportunities

Choice of tipple 'determines different moods',"Spirits may make you angry or tearful, while red wine or beer may make you relax, research says.",[],None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Do you know how alcohol changes your mood?

Different types of alcoholic drink change and shape your mood in different ways, says a study into drinking and emotions.

Spirits may make you feel angry, sexy or tearful, while red wine or beer may make you feel relaxed, say researchers.

They questioned nearly 30,000 people aged 18-34 from 21 different countries for the study in the journal BMJ Open.

All the respondents drank beer, wine and spirits, and many said each type of alcohol had a different effect on them.

While having a few drinks can be enjoyable, researchers hope their findings will help highlight the dangers of dependent drinking.

Angry outbursts

People build up tolerance to alcohol over time and can end up drinking more to feel the same ""positive"" effects that they enjoy.

But they also risk getting negative ones too, says researcher Prof Mark Bellis from Public Health Wales NHS Trust.

The anonymous online survey, which recruited respondents via newspaper and magazine adverts and social media, found:

Red wine appeared to make people more lethargic than white wine

Respondents were most likely to report feeling relaxed when drinking red wine or beer

More than 40% said drinking spirits made them feel sexy

Over half said drinking spirits also gave them energy and confidence

But around a third said they felt aggressive when drinking spirits

Drinking spirits was more likely than all other drink types to be associated with feelings of aggression, illness, restlessness and tearfulness

Men were significantly more likely than women to associate feelings of aggression with all types of alcohol, particularly heavier drinkers

However, the findings show only an association and do not explain the reasons for changes.

Prof Bellis said the setting in which the alcohol was consumed was an important factor that the study tried to take into consideration by asking about drinking at home and outside of the home.

""Young people will often drink spirits on a night out, whereas wine might be drunk more at home, with a meal.

""There will be an element of expectation too. Someone who wants to relax might choose to have a beer or a glass of wine.""

He said the way different drinks are marketed and promoted might encourage people to select certain drinks to suit different moods, but that this could backfire if it triggered negative emotions.

""People may rely on alcohol to help them feel a certain way. People might drink to feel more confident or relaxed but they also risk other negative emotional responses too.""

Prof Bellis and his colleagues at King's College London said the findings suggested that dependent drinkers might rely on alcohol to generate the positive emotions they associated with drinking - they were five times more likely to feel energised than low-risk drinkers.

He also said the study revealed a difference between men and women's emotional relationship with different alcoholic drinks.

""We got stronger emotional relationships with women across pretty well every type of emotion, except for aggression."" Aggression, he said, was more likely to be felt among men.

Dr John Larsen, from Drinkaware, said: ""This study highlights the importance of understanding why people choose to drink certain alcoholic drinks and what effect they expect these drinks will have on them.

""The UK chief medical officers' guideline for both men and women states that in order to keep health risks from alcohol to a low level it is safest not to be drinking more than 14 units a week on a regular basis.""

That equates to 12 single measures of spirits, six pints of beer or six 175ml glasses of wine a week.

Experts say setting a minimum unit price of 50 pence per unit would help cut alcohol-related deaths.

A minimum price policy will come into force on 1 May 2018 in Scotland.

Legislation to establish a minimum price is currently under active consideration by the Welsh Government and by the Irish Senate. There are no plans yet to do the same in England, although the Home Office says the policy is under review.","['study', 'alcohol', 'tipple', 'drinks', 'determines', 'different', 'spirits', 'wine', 'drink', 'likely', 'drinking', 'feel', 'choice', 'moods']","Different types of alcoholic drink change and shape your mood in different ways, says a study into drinking and emotions.

Ex-burglar says 'some people need to be in prison',A prolific burglar with more than 100 convictions says a second chance helped him turn his life around but some people need to be in jail.,[],None,"Image caption Ex-offender Jodie Hind has been in and out of prison since the age of 14

Ex-burglar and drug pusher Jodie Hind has a string of convictions longer than his arm - more than 100. So many in fact, he cannot remember the exact number.

He was first jailed for theft on his 14th birthday and for the next 16 years was in and out of prison dozens of times for a ""mind-blowing"" number of offences.

At his lowest ebb he was breaking into houses to steal money to feed a heroin and crack cocaine habit.

And when things were going ""well"", in his eyes, he was making £1,000 a day selling drugs and spending it on sports cars, jewellery and clothes.

But every few months he would find himself back inside. According to the 34-year-old, most people had written him off and did not believe he could break the cycle of crime.

But break it he did, with a lot of professional help, and today he is drug-free and has not committed a crime for more than four years.

'Big baby'

Society was better off when I was inside before I had confronted my problems Jodie Hind

On Wednesday Judge Peter Bowers caused controversy when he said burglars were ""courageous"" and decided to give serial burglar Richard Rochford a supervision order instead of jail.

The Teesside Crown Court judge also said he thought prison did criminals ""little good"".

Mr Hind agrees that jail does not always work, but many offenders still need to be locked up.

He said: ""Some people need to be in prison for the safety of the public. Society was better off when I was inside before I had confronted my problems.

Image caption Jessie Jacobs said ""the whole area of justice"" needs reform

""I was not facing up to the fact I had character defects and these were were manifesting themselves in addictions such as drug-taking and alcohol.

""I had problems such as managing anger, I was like a big baby, and replacing one addiction with another.

""But I have a conscience and I feel most shame about dealing in drugs. I am also haunted about burgling people's homes.

""I thought I could cheat my way through life but with lots of help I have turned my life around and changed my way of thinking.""

'Without hope'

Through the help of Alcoholics Anonymous and other addiction agencies, Mr Hind now works for Five Lamps, a Stockton charity which helps the unemployed get jobs or start their own business.

Mr Hind said his father was an alcoholic but on the whole he and his sister had a good upbringing. But he kept lapsing into crime because he was ""immature and without hope"".

The judge could have chosen his words more carefully - burglars are not brave but they may well be desperate Jessie Jacobs, Chief Executive of charity A Way Out

He said: ""My recovery was very public. I've decided to stay in the area where I committed my crimes and a lot of people don't approve of me.

""But I believe in reform, I am accountable for my actions. I am up for what the judge has said, some people should be in prison but the prison numbers are too big.

""I believe with the right help people can be reformed.""

Mr Hind is not afraid of having a relapse. He said: ""Everyday I take stock. I have changed my way of thinking.

""I am responsible for my actions and learn from other people who have overcome their problems.""

Jessie Jacobs is the chief executive of A Way Out, a charity which helps women and young people to tackle a range of problems including depression, addiction, self harm and exploitation.

It has been running for 10 years and helps about 1,000 people a year.

Ms Jacobs said: ""The judge could have chosen his words more carefully. Burglars are not brave but they may well be desperate. So while I do not condone the judge's choice of words I welcome the fact that he has opened up a debate.

""He said he thought jail rarely worked and I believe we need to reexamine and reform the whole area of justice.

How deep brain stimulation silenced food cravings,"As a last-resort treatment, one severely depressed patient had electrodes implanted in her brain, with some surprising beneficial effects.",['Melissa Hogenboom'],3/12/2018 0:00,"Anna had been depressed for much of her adult life, seeking a range of treatments that might help her condition. She took anti-depressants, underwent psychotherapy and even experienced electroconvulsive therapy – which involves passing electricity through the whole brain.

Treatments like these were only effective for short periods, and her depression would soon return. Another issue she faced was that she was morbidly obese, weighing 183kg with a BMI of 63 at her heaviest. This resulted in severely limited mobility which, naturally, exacerbated her depression, putting in place a vicious circle of poor health.

In some rare cases, the brain can be de-tuned from debilitating behaviours

Gastric bypass surgery helped her lose some weight but not as much as expected from such a procedure, and it had little impact on her depression. As a last resort treatment, psychiatrists took a drastic decision to implant an electrical device in her brain, an invasive therapy known as deep brain stimulation. It’s a treatment that’s already frequently used to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy.

Not only did this treatment significantly help her depression, it had another astonishing outcome – she lost more weight than she had with any previous treatment, losing almost 50% more weight (2.8kg or 6.1lbs) per month than she had done after the gastric bypass surgery. Thomas Munte a neurologist at the University of Lubeck, in Germany, who treated Anna, says that while the initial goal was to treat her depression, the weight loss was the “secondary target” of the surgery. In her case, the two were seemingly linked.

That Anna successfully lost weight following the treatment is opening up new discussions about how to tackle what we know is a world-wide epidemic. It is also is revealing that in some rare cases, the brain can be “de-tuned” from debilitating behaviours, like addiction.

Deep brain stimulating remains controversial but it is not a new treatment. It dates back to the 1930s when neurosurgeons were not nearly as cautious as they are today. It was the neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield who first developed a daring technique for treating epilepsy. He would stimulate different parts of the brain with an electrical probe, keeping patients awake during the process to understand the effect. The idea was that that the brain area causing an issue could be identified and destroyed.

In fact, scientists would essentially “cook parts of the brain”, says Munte, to create small lesions. This was also done to rid individuals of movement disorders like dystonia, which causes repetitive twitching or tremors. It was called “stereotactic surgery” and was dubbed “a period of unrivalled empirical human experimentation”.

At a similar time, a neurologist called Antonio Egas Moniz was busy removing small parts of his patients’ brains in an attempt to rid them of psychological disorders, including depression. He would remove parts of a patient’s frontal lobe – an area vital for forward planning and personality. The treatment was considered successful in several cases – and the inevitable consequences and personality changes were deemed necessary side-effects. Surprisingly, this work gave him a Nobel Prize in 1949. Removing parts of the brain and then observing the results served a useful purpose for the study and practice of brain stimulation – it allowed neurologists to understand which brain areas might benefit from electrodes.

When antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs became more commonly prescribed, the prevalence of these invasive, irreversible techniques reduced, but the lessons learnt for the brain areas involved would become important for deep brain stimulation as we know it today.

In 2002, deep brain stimulation was approved to treat Parkinson’s disease. It has been extremely effective and more than 40,000 patients have now been treated. Though it’s largely used for tremor disorders, this heralded its use in the treatment of other conditions, such a severe depression in the case of patients like Anna. To perform deep brain stimulation, first scientists use a drill to put a burr hole in a patient’s skull. After that, they place electrodes onto the brain itself. The patient is often awake, enabling researchers to test the specific area while the brain is stimulated.

In Anna’s case the target area for stimulation was the nucleus accumbens, which is part of the brain’s reward centre and an important area for processing pleasure. The area has been linked to depression – as depressed individuals show a reduced interest in pleasure. “You can observe an emotional response by a patient when you are stimulating [this area],” explains Munte, who spoke to BBC Future about his patient, as she wishes to remain anonymous. His analysis was written up in the journal Neurocase.

Treating obesity

Obesity in some individuals, can be due to an altered reward system in the brain, says Munte. Some obese people even show differing brain patterns when exposed to pictures of delectable-looking food than do thinner people. The theory is that the nucleus accumbens is the area that draws addicted people to the object of their desire, be it food, alcohol or drugs. Usually the area of our brain that helps us act rationally prevents the impulsive immediate-reward-hungry part our brain from taking over. But our reward system can, at times “overtake our good manners,” says neurosurgeon Piotr Zielinski, of the University of Physical Education and Sport in Gdansk, Poland. The diet industry flourishes thanks to our nucleus accumbens, he says.

The addictive power of our brain’s reward system was highlighted by a famous 1950s study of rats. They were more inclined to stimulate this brain area than to eat or drink. If this brain area is “disturbed” or perhaps even inhibited (stopped) by electrical stimulation, then the “motivational magnet is no longer there and you’re not drawn to this object,” says Munte.

Sometimes in medicine you start doing [clinical treatments] before you even know exactly how it works

That brain stimulation inhibits an area of the brain from performing its function is still a theory, but one that is strengthened by research in animals. For instance, a study using rats found that brain simulation resulted in an increase of the brain’s inhibitory chemical, gaba, which is released when certain areas need to be constrained. Another study showed that individuals which are better at controlling unwanted thoughts, had more of this chemical.

We still don’t know precisely the impact of brain stimulation and that is one of the reasons why it remains controversial. “Sometimes in medicine you start doing [clinical treatments] before you even know exactly how it works,” says Munte. And for good reason, for Parkinson’s disease, deep brain stimulation has proven to have a much greater impact on quality of life than other treatments.

We may soon see similarly positive impacts for depression and even obesity, now that other promising cases, similar to Anna’s, are emerging. For instance, Zielinski has seen the practice broadened out from treating only Parkinson’s – his department has performed over 2,500 procedures since the 1990s – to also treating pathological aggression, Tourette’s syndrome and obsessive compulsive disorder.

She ceased to steal food from her parents' locked fridge

He has now also treated three people with obesity using deep brain stimulation, all as a last-resort measure when no other technique was lastingly effective. Similarly to Anna, obesity was treated as a compulsive disorder. One patient’s obesity was attributed to a childhood tumour that damaged an area of her brain important for regulating hunger and feeling full.

This patient’s thoughts were completely fixated on food. “Therefore we assumed that bariatric surgery was not a solution,” explains Zielinski. Although her resulting weight loss was not dramatic, the impact it had was life-changing. Brain stimulation has enabled her to live independently. She can now study and “think about anything other than food,” he says. “She ceased to steal food from her parents' locked fridge.”

Addicted brain

Still, Munte stresses that are far from using brain stimulation as a widespread treatment for obesity, especially as it should be considered a last-resort approach. It is an expensive, invasive technique, so is clearly not suitable for the majority of individuals with obesity.

Conventional weight loss programmes rarely produce lasting effects

It is most suited for the subset of obese patients who show addictive-like tendencies towards food. Sonja Yokum, a neuroscientist who studies obesity at the Oregon Research Institute, has been studying exactly that. She showed that food can trigger an addictive-like process in the brain, which tellingly shares the neural symptoms of other more commonly understood addictive disorders, like alcohol and drug addiction. Worryingly, some people are more at risk than others, in part because of how they are wired.

For instance, Yokum revealed that teenagers who had brain areas most attentive towards food were the most risk of gaining an unhealthy amount of weight. “One possible explanation is that some individuals have an elevated reward region responsivity (which could be biologically based), which may render them more vulnerable to food-cue-induced cravings, resulting in greater caloric intake and weight gain,” she explains. This offers one explanation to why conventional weight loss programmes rarely produce lasting effects.

Anna was therefore an ideal trial case for deep brain stimulation, both because of her depression and her addictive-like tendencies towards food, diagnosed by several questionnaires. She represents a subset of obese individuals who fall into the category of an addictive disorder towards food. They typically find it extremely difficult to prevent themselves eating when presented with food, in a similar way that an alcoholic in the midst of addiction may struggle to walk past a bar without going inside.

Further, while these individuals show greater brain activation to food than do individuals of a healthy weight, when they finally get their reward (food), the brain activation decreases. This shows, says Yokum, another factor similar to that found in substance abuse – that addicted people get excitement at the prospect of what they desire, but as soon as they get it, activation in this area actually decreases. This might therefore mean that “they need to eat a lot more to gain the same level of excitement as before”, she says.

This is clearly problematic when it comes to food – a substance we need to survive. Obese individuals who show addictive-like behaviours towards food may find it extremely difficult to control the intake of that which they crave, because it cannot be completely avoided.

That’s why Yokum and her team are developing training tasks that are intended to help obese individuals reset the way their brain responds to food. They do this by showing digital images of health food on a patient and asking them to click ‘like’ towards it, doing the opposite with unhealthy food. “We are trying to train the brain this way,” says Yokum.

Less invasive, not to mention cheaper, techniques like this could be vital in addressing what we know is a worldwide epidemic, with 650 million adults and 340 million children and adolescents currently considered obese. Obesity contributes to an estimated 2.8 million deaths per year worldwide.

While deep brain stimulation is clearly not the answer for the majority, that it shows such positive initial results demonstates that in the most severe cases, experimental treatments can change lives.

There is certainly no one-size-fits-all approach, Anna’s complex case highlights that there is often more than one issue at play contributing to overeating in obese individuals. If we understand that, then a targeted approach like deep brain stimulation can clearly be an important step to help some individuals lose the weight they so desperately want – or even need to.

The Secret Footballer: I want to 'out' myself - but fear I'll be sued,"The Secret Footballer says ""everyone wants to out"" him. He would even quite like to do it himself but fears legal action.",[],4/10/2018 10:56,"The Secret Footballer thought about taking his life during a thunderstorm

He is the former Premier League footballer behind four anonymous books which give behind the scenes insight into the game.

But the self-styled Secret Footballer says people are desperate to ""out him"".

He admits he would even quite like to do it himself - but the fear of legal action and bankruptcy are the things keeping the Secret Footballer's identity a secret.

Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live's At Home With Colin Murray, he discusses the time he tried to be hit by lightning, and breaking his five-year abstinence to share a drink with famous chef Keith Floyd.

'If I stand under that, that will be it'

The Secret Footballer was still playing as late as 2011. He is English, has played for at least two Premier League clubs and was relegated from the top flight on the final day of the season. He once booked out the top floor of a hotel in Paris because he heard that someone he didn't like was staying there.

After he stopped playing, he started a column, and wrote four books. In 2010 he was diagnosed with depression and at one stage he considered taking his own life after struggling with mental health.

I was really low. We lived next to a farmers' field and there was a power cable that runs across the field with a big power box in one corner.

My wife was out and I remember walking out of the house in just my football shorts and there was all this thunder and lightning around me. I had no top on and I was barefoot. There was one beautiful oak tree in the middle of this field and I remember walking towards that thinking ""if I stand under that, that will be it"".

As I was walking towards it, this bolt of lightning hit the power box and it exploded. It was spectacular. It knocked all the power out in the houses and that snapped me out of it and I went back inside.

I told my wife a year later what happened but by then I was kind of coming out of it. If I had got to that tree and that was that, at that moment I would not have cared.

'The more money around, the more anxious it makes you'

The former Premier League footballer believes his writing saved his life and steered him away from the temptations of alcohol following his career. He talks about the difficulties faced by those who leave the game, be it alcoholism, divorce, or mental health issues.

What you should consider is that when you retire on the Sunday, by the Monday you lose all your mates and all the admiration of the fans. Everything goes off the cliff. Football is completely irreplaceable.

The moment you stopped, all the temptation was there. I didn't drink for five years but one of my heroes, Keith Floyd, was doing a show at a theatre and I couldn't not have a glass of wine with Keith Floyd so that was what broke my ban.

The more money around the more anxious it made you, and you get paranoid about everything because if you don't have anything you have nothing to lose.

You have got to try and keep yourself stimulated. I was lucky that the writing actually gave me something to do.

Keith Floyd shared a glass of wine with The Secret Footballer

'They are going to make a TV drama on the books'

The Secret Footballer grew up on a council estate in rural England and only began playing organised football relatively late. He signed his first professional terms at the age of 21 and had what he describes as a lucrative career. Since retiring, though, he has become more prominent - albeit anonymously - with a column in the Guardian, the publication of his books and, potentially, a television drama.

Some of the most interesting ex-players I have met do not have a profile.

I think that the secret footballer was a good idea and one that was well worth exploring. There was an explosion in help for mental illness after the first book and the Football Association and the Professional Footballers' Association decided to act on it, so I'm kind of proud of it. But I think I ran away with it without thinking where I wanted to take it.

Everyone wants to out me but only I'm going to do that. The issue would be a legal one and I would probably have to bankrupt myself in order to survive. You have to prepare for the worst and, while there are no names in the books, there's a lot of money in football and a lot of people with a lot of money. They don't even have to be proved right they just have to put a case on.

My autobiography will sell on the back of me outing myself but I can't do it at the moment even though I want to.

Cheers! A celebration of literature’s booziest books,Take a literary bar crawl with BBC Culture as Hephzibah Anderson reveals how booze and books make such fine bedfellows.,['Hephzibah Anderson'],7/14/2014 0:00,"Oscar Wilde wrote of his inordinate fondness for absinthe and Dorothy Parker, who was at her waspish best when she disliked something, was partial to a martini or three (at the most –by four she was famously “under the host”). Ernest Hemingway’s poison was a mojito (among others) and William Faulkner’s a mint julep, while Dylan Thomas reached straight for the whiskey. Again and again and again.

Alcohol plays a well-documented role in literary life – or at least it used to, what with liquid lunches and all-night benders that ended at the typewriter. (The clatter of those keys must have been murder with a hangover, which perhaps explains why certain authors chose to remain drunk instead.)

These days, wordsmiths tend to be a more sober bunch but their reputation for enjoying a nip of this, a flagon of that, and a vat of the other, endures. It’s hardly surprising that some of the stronger stuff has sloshed onto their pages and into their stories. Flip through classics old and new and you’ll find scenes of weepy, wanton, comical, carefree and tragic inebriation, in which beds get set alight (as in Kingsley Amis’ Lucky Jim), bears are tied to policemen and thrown into rivers (Tolstoy’s War and Peace), and wives sold (Thomas Hardy’s The Mayor of Casterbridge). Children’s literature isn’t exempt either – remember when Roald Dahl’s Fantastic Mr Fox led a raid on Farmer Bean’s cider cellar?

Proof reading

Some authors run up a longer bar tab than others. As one Thomas Pynchon devotee has discovered, there’s enough liquor in the Pulitzer Prize winner’s books to generate a dedicated blog. In May, the anonymous fan, who also tweets as @Drunk Pynchon, embarked on a project to imbibe every drink mentioned in every Pynchon novel. Let’s hope he has a strong constitution because Gravity’s Rainbow alone features almost 50 different libations, including something that calls for grain alcohol, beef tea, grenadine, herbal infusions (blue skullcap, valerian root, motherwort and lady’s slipper, no less) and a dash of cough syrup.

It’s the kind of drink you could imagine Raoul Duke and Dr Gonzo consuming on their road trip through southern California in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. In fact, it’s pretty much the only thing they don’t drink. Alcohol fumes rise from the page as they wash down a rainbow of pills with everything from beer to tequila. Their baggage includes a pint of raw ether.

And then there’s the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster’, as invented by Zaphod Beeblebrox in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. Imbibing this cocktail, Douglas Adams wrote, is “like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon”, wrapped “round a large gold brick”, which is no wonder with ingredients like Arcturan Mega-gin, Fallian marsh gas and the tooth of an Angolian Suntiger. Its effects, you might imagine, are every bit as disorienting as the potion that Lewis Carroll’s Alice glugs.

A more refined literary cocktail list might feature a sidecar, as sipped by wealthy Arthur Ruskin in Bonfire of the Vanities, a white angel, which was Holly Golightly’s choice, or a refreshing daiquiri, James Wormold’s order in Graham Greene’s Our Man in Havana. Jay Gatsby prefers gin rickeys while Daisy Buchanan is a mint julep kind of a gal. For Anthony Blanche in Brideshead Revisited, it’s brandy alexanders, that sticky mix of cream, cognac and crème de cacao. Personally, I prefer the sound of the jack roses that boozy Jake Barnes knocks back in Ernest Hemingway’s career-maker, The Sun Also Rises. They’re a mix of applejack, lemon or lime juice, and a splash of grenadine.

There are simpler drinks, too. In On the Road, Dean and Sal hang out in a San Francisco ‘sawdust saloon’ where a guy named Walter orders wine spodiodi, ‘a shot of port wine, a shot of whisky, and a shot of port wine’.

Then there’s the Moloko Plus. Also called a Knifey Moloko, this fictitious tipple comes in many forms but is essentially milk with barbiturates. Featured in Anthony Burgess’s A Clockwork Orange, it’s drunk by the narrator Alex in preparation for “a bit of the old ultraviolence”.

Raymond Chandler’s chess-playing sleuth, Philip Marlowe, keeps things altogether mellower with a gimlet, a recipe for which appears in The Long Goodbye. The drink becomes the glue in a fledgling friendship between the loner private eye and a washed-up playboy named Terry Lennox. “A real gimlet is half gin and half Rose's Lime Juice and nothing else,” Lennox tells Marlowe. “It beats martinis hollow.”

And since he brings them up, it would be remiss not to at least nod to the “very strong” vesper martini that Ian Fleming describes so precisely in Casino Royale. It comprises three measures of gin, one of vodka and a half-measure of the French aperitif Lillet. Shake until ice-cold, then pour into a deep champagne goblet and finish with a twist.

‘In vino veritas’

Of course, authors were dousing their pages with liquor long before the invention of the cocktail. Weave your way back towards the canon’s beginning, and you’ll find the hero of Beowulf defending the king’s vast mead hall against the marauding monster Grendel, who’s seemingly incensed by the drinkers’ din. Mead, if you’ve never encountered it, is a honey-based wine with an ale-like taste, beloved by humans if not Old English ogres.

It pops up in Shakespeare’s plays, too, along with still more obscure wines like malmsey and canary (it really did have a yellow tint, apparently). For that joker Falstaff, though, there was only one tipple: sherry. As he eulogises in Henry IV, Part II, it makes him witty and bold, warms his blood and sets his face aglow. Drunk, in other words.

For authors, on the page though infinitely less so their lives, drunkenness is put to good use, becoming another tool for illuminating their characters’ traits and fates: in vino veritas, as the saying goes. And while it wreaks its fair share of Bacchic destruction (just consider the middle portion of Donna Tartt’s The Goldfinch), in moderation, it can also be a force for good, as when Ebenezer Scrooge offers to share a bowl of Smoking Bishop (that’s port, wine, oranges and spices) with Bob at the end of A Christmas Carol.

If just reading about all this boozy over-indulgence has left you a little tipsy, there’s one drink from Gravity’s Rainbow that might be best: a Shirley Temple.

Cheers!

Canada politician Patrick Brown resigns amid sexual allegations,Patrick Brown's career was derailed within hours amid claims of sexual misconduct against teens.,"['Robin Levinson-King', 'Jessica Murphy', 'Bbc News']",None,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Ontario Progressive Conservative leader Patrick Brown has resigned in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations

A Canadian politician has resigned just months before a key election after two women accused him of inappropriate sexual behaviour when they were teens.

How long does it take to fall from grace?

For Canadian politician Patrick Brown, it took mere hours.

Late Wednesday evening, CTV News published the accounts of two women accusing Brown of sexual misconduct when he was a federal MP in his late 20s and early 30s and they were teenagers.

WARNING: This article contains graphic details that some readers may find upsetting.

Although he denies the allegations, by early Thursday morning, he was no longer the leader of the province's centre-right Progressive Conservative party.

Both women say Mr Brown plied them with alcohol when they were below the legal drinking age. A noted teetotaller, he was stone-cold sober, they say.

Both women say it happened in his private home. The never-married politician was a federal MP at the time.

And both women say he pressured them or tried to pressure them into sexual activity.

One says he picked her up at a bar more than a decade ago, and brought her back to his house with the promise of booze. When they were alone, he exposed himself and asked for oral sex.

The other says he met her on a plane in 2012 when she was 18, and quickly began flirting with her over social media. He offered her a job in his constituency office, which she accepted. Then at an after-party in his home after a charity hockey match, she claims he pushed her on the bed, got on top of her and pressed his erection into her body. She says she froze, and asked to be taken home. He agreed.

Soon after the incident, he offered her a job accompanying him to India.

""He told me that I, you know, he thought that I would look really good on an elephant,"" she told CTV News.

Neither anonymous account has been independently corroborated by the BBC.

During a last-minute, late-evening press conference, where he appeared shaken and near tears, Mr Brown vehemently denied any impropriety and refused to step down as leader of the Ontario PC party

""It's never okay for anybody - for anyone - to feel they have been a victim of sexual harassment, or feel threatened in any way,"" he said.

Moments later, publicly and en masse, three seniors aides, including his campaign manager and chief of staff, announced their resignation.

Other staffers soon followed.

Shortly after 1am local time, Mr Brown bowed to pressure.

""These allegations are false and have been difficult to hear,"" he said in his statement.

Mr Brown says he will keep his seat in the provincial legislature as he fights to clear his name.

He now joins company with politicians from around the globe whose careers have been derailed by sexual misconduct allegations as the Me Too movement gains momentum.

The speed of Mr Brown's fall can be linked to the movement that has seen women - and men - share personal stories of inappropriate sexual behaviour.

But politics played a role as well.

Canadian political parties will have watched as, south of the border, former Alabama Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore became the first Republican to lose an election for a Senate seat in Alabama in 25 years.

A number of women accused Mr Moore of sexual misconduct when they were teenagers, including allegations that he sexually abused a 14-year-old girl.

Despite mounting accusations, Mr Moore refused to drop out of the race, and was defeated by Democrat Douglas Jones in December.

Mr Brown wasn't the only resignation on Thursday.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Sport Minister Kent Hehr had resigned his cabinet position pending an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment levied against Mr Hehr on social media.Mr Hehr said he welcomes the investigative process and does not ""want to be a distraction to all the good work being done by our government"".

But Mr Brown's resignation resonated particularly because he was the front-runner for one of the most powerful political jobs in the country - premier of Canada's most populous province that is responsible for almost 40% of the country's GDP.

Now, he is persona non grata as the party scrambles to mount a defence against incumbent Liberal Premier Kathleen Wynne.

Mr Brown ""is entitled to a legal defence and due process, but he cannot lead us into an election as a result of these allegations"", said the Progressive Conservative's deputy leaders in a statement on Thursday.

Deputy party leader Sylvia Jones referred to the allegations as a ""hiccup"" and said the party was unanimous in its belief that Mr Brown could not continue as leader.

Federal Conservative party leader Andrew Scheer, once Mr Brown's Parliamentary colleague, was quick to condemn the ""extremely serious"" allegations against the former PC leader.

""Sexual misconduct, and sexual harassment have no place in Canadian society, especially within our political system,"" he said, and called for a full investigation into the accusations.

Mr Trudeau, whose federal Liberals have close ties to their provincial counterparts led by Ms Wynne, has a record of taking a hard line on sexual harassment allegations.

In 2015, he quickly ejected two Liberals MPs from his caucus after two rival female politicians accused them of sexual harassment.

His stance three years ago looks prescient in a post-Harvey Weinstein scandal world.

What happens next?

Mr Brown's resignation has thrown June's provincial election for a loop.

The Ontario PC's were ahead in the polls, ahead in fundraising and ahead in voter recruitment.

Their growing popularity was seen by many as an indictment against Ms Wynne's Liberal Party, which had ruled the province for 14 years but whose popular support had been chipped away by divisive policy decisions and rumours of political corruption.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne comments on allegations against Patrick Brown

Now, Mr Brown's resignation means that the Ontario Progressive Conservatives will have to pick a new leader, fast, if they hope to succeed in toppling the Liberals.

Ms Wynne weighed in on the allegations against her former opponent on Thursday from her desk at Queen's Park, the provincial legislature.

The backdrop made a potent statement on her intention to remain in power.

""I was shocked,"" she said of the allegations.

""It was very courageous of them to step forward and I hope they have the support they need because it was a very difficult thing, and they have had to carry it around with them for years.""","['brown', 'allegations', 'patrick', 'misconduct', 'image', 'amid', 'politician', 'sexual', 'party', 'ontario', 'leader', 'resigns', 'women', 'mr', 'canada']","Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Patrick Brown: ""These allegations are false""Both women say Mr Brown plied them with alcohol when they were below the legal drinking age.

Obituary: Dora Bryan,"Dora Bryan, who has died 91, was a talented character actress who played everything from Ibsen to Absolutely Fabulous.",[],None,"Image caption Bryan starred in her own BBC show in 1964, in which she sang and performed sketches from London revues and musicals

Dora Bryan was a talented character actress who could turn her hand to everything from musicals to Shakespeare, farce to tragedy.

The variety of the roles she played, including parts in plays by Ibsen and Pinter, belied her caricature as a wide-eyed dizzy blonde.

Born Dora May Broadbent in Southport, Lancashire in 1924, she went to a council school and, encouraged by her ambitious mother, made her first stage appearance at the age of 12, in pantomime in Manchester.

Image caption Bryan recorded the post-war radio show Much Binding in the Marsh with Nicholas Parsons (far right)

During World War 2 she worked in repertory theatre and with the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) - an organisation set up in 1939 to provide entertainment for British armed forces personnel during the war.

She moved to London in 1945 and appeared in a number of West End productions - notably in the Lyric and Globe revues in the 1950s.

Image caption In 2000, Bryan joined the cast of Last of the Summer Wine but left five years later

She changed her name to Bryan, taking it from the match manufacturers Bryant and May. She lost the closing ""t"" when a theatre programme misspelled her name.

In 1966, the actress played the title role in Hello, Dolly at Drury Lane, eating a full chicken dinner on stage six nights a week and at two matinees.

In 1968 she played nine parts as the star of They Don't Grow on Trees at the Prince of Wales.

Later, she was in the National Theatre's She Stoops to Conquer (for which she won an award) and a revival of Charlie Girl. And she took the West End by storm in a lavish 2002 musical production of The Full Monty.

Speaking to Michael Parkinson on Desert Island Discs in 1987, she said musical theatre had always held a special place in her heart.

""I was in rep for seven years and to get a marvellous part in a play is great, it really is super, particularly if it's a funny part and there is nothing like making an audience laugh.

""But with musicals, I like the atmosphere backstage. You go backstage in a real theatre, in a real plush and gilt theatre and you can shout to the dressing room opposite you and you're all clustered in together, you get a real theatrical atmosphere.""

Her theatre career was crowned with a prestigious Olivier award in recognition of her role, as Meg, in a National Theatre production of Harold Pinter's The Birthday Party.

Ab Fab

But she was not just a stage actress - she made her big screen debut in 1948's The Fallen Idol. About 40 further films followed, including The Blue Lamp, The Great St. Trinian's Train Robbery, The Sandwich Man and Two a Penny.

The peak of her career came as she played the domineering, promiscuous, alcoholic mother, Helen in the 1961 film A Taste of Honey. The role won her a Bafta award for best actress.

Image caption In 1994, she was cast in the play Bed, which presented a vast dreamscape of seven very old people - all of whom share the same vast bed

Image caption Bryan and June Whitfield acted together in the fourth series of Absolutely Fabulous

On television, she appeared in According to Dora and Both Ends Meet and, latterly, she joined a star-studded cast in Last of the Summer Wine.

In an interview with the Church Times in 2006, she said: ""I got my part as Roz in Last of the Summer Wine through Thora Hird. We had always been friends, and always nattered on about the old days.

""We knew actors most people have now forgotten. Then, a few years ago, she suddenly said: 'I wish you were in it with me.'""

Image caption Among Bryan's numerous TV appearances was an episode of Casualty

She also brought the house down with a recurring cameo role in Absolutely Fabulous as June Whitfield's on-screen friend Dolly.

This is Your Life

Dora Bryan was also in the post-war radio show Much Binding in the Marsh. And she once made a novelty record, All I Want for Christmas is a Beatle, which became an unexpected hit.

However her life was also touched by tragedy.

Her adopted daughter Georgina died from alcoholism, her son Daniel endured a debilitating illness and she herself experienced alcoholism.

She told the Church Times she was a member of Alcoholics Anonymous.

""I got very lonely on tour,"" she said, ""and used to order room-service with a bottle of wine, which was not the answer. I don't miss it at all, and just enjoy coffee or tea.""

Bryan's husband, Lancashire County Cricketer Bill Lawton, died from Alzheimer's in 2008 and Dora, in her later years, became unable to work, as short-term memory loss affected her ability to learn lines.

She was honoured twice by TV tribute show This Is Your Life, in 1962 and again in 1989.

In her book, According to Dora, she remembered her first appearance.

""I was hoping the BBC would have filmed a message from my brother John in South Africa. It never occurred to me that they would have gone to all the trouble and expense of flying him from Cape Town, and I must admit that when he walked on to the stage with his wife Marguerite, I cried a little from sheer happiness.""

On her second appearance, host Eamonn Andrews ""ambushed"" the actress in her living room, before whisking her to the TV studio to hear tributes from her friends and family.

""Tonight?"" exclaimed the star. ""Oh dear! I've got to do some auditions at four!""

Her final film appearance was in Gone to the Dogs (2006) opposite Anthony Booth.

The indomitable actress said that in her life she was helped through the bad times by her family, her faith and the next challenge around the corner.","['stage', 'theatre', 'played', 'caption', 'actress', 'wine', 'bryan', 'role', 'dora', 'tv', 'obituary']","Image caption Bryan starred in her own BBC show in 1964, in which she sang and performed sketches from London revues and musicalsDora Bryan was a talented character actress who could turn her hand to everything from musicals to Shakespeare, farce to tragedy.

Byrne urges help for families damaged by alcohol abuse,"Ex-minister Liam Byrne calls for more help for children whose parents are ""hazardous drinkers"" after speaking publicly about his father's fight with alcohol addiction.",[],None,"Image copyright PA Image caption Mr Byrne said his father had fought alcohol addiction for 30 years

Ex-minister Liam Byrne has called for more to be done to help children whose parents are ""hazardous drinkers"" after speaking publicly about his father's fight with alcohol addiction.

The Labour MP is urging people to ""break the silence"" about the issue, a taboo subject he says must be tackled.

He told the BBC it ""hurts like hell"" to talk about his father, who died in the run-up to May's general election.

Children at risk must be identified and adults given the right help, he said.

Mr Byrne, who served in the cabinet under Gordon Brown, said he was going public about the subject for the first time to draw attention to the plight of families whose lives had been damaged by alcohol abuse, a problem which he said was ""cascading down the generations"".

The MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill has used a parliamentary debate in Westminster Hall to draw attention to the issue, saying he had lived with the effects of his father's drinking on his family since he was seven years old but many families had had it ""much worse"".

'Sense of shame'

Earlier, he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""My Dad was an amazing guy, a very charismatic guy, a great public servant who inspired me to go into politics.""

""He struggled with alcohol addiction for 30 years. That struggle, that addiction hurt us as a family and before the election it killed him.""

While alcohol addiction affected different families in different ways, he said he was conscious of the ""sense of shame"" that he felt about it and the fact that the illness often transcended generations of the same family.

""Children of alcoholics are three times more likely to become alcoholics themselves and that was the same for my Dad. He was the child of an alcoholic.

""So if we are to break the cycle, I think we have to break the silence about the damage that it is doing to children and to our country.""

Referring to the public reaction to Charles Kennedy's death earlier this year, he said the subject of alcohol addiction - from which the former Lib Dem leader suffered and which contributed to his death - was too often swept under the carpet or talked about in coded language.

'Giving a voice'

Like discussions about mental health, he said the subject must be brought out into the open.

""When Charles died a lot of people started talking about demons and I just thought 'it was not demons, he was addicted to alcohol'. Unless we normalise the conversation about this we are not going to make progress.""

With only one in 20 ""dependent drinkers"" receiving help and alcohol-related admissions to Accident and Emergency departments increasing in two thirds of the country, Mr Byrne said urgent action was now required in three areas.

He wants a major public health information campaign to make parents aware of the damage they are doing to their children while dependents must be put in touch with professionals who can help them, such as GPs, nurses or social workers.

Finally, he said ""we have to make sure that the right treatment is in place so when parents ask for help, it's there"".

Speaking in Parliament, childrens' minister Edward Timpson praised Mr Byrne's ""courage"" for speaking out and his ""determination to give a voice to the many thousands of children who find themselves in the same predicament"".

Mr Timpson said social workers and teachers must be equipped to respond to alcohol-related distress, while the public sector as a whole must be more consistent in its approach to ensure ""families who feel unsupported and children who feel lonely no longer have that as a feature of their lives.""

He added: ""I will undertake to talk with ministerial colleagues around how we raise public awareness of this issue in a similar ilk to the way we have on smoking.""","['alcohol', 'damaged', 'byrne', 'abuse', 'urges', 'parents', 'public', 'addiction', 'help', 'children', 'families', 'subject', 'mr']","Image copyright PA Image caption Mr Byrne said his father had fought alcohol addiction for 30 yearsEx-minister Liam Byrne has called for more to be done to help children whose parents are ""hazardous drinkers"" after speaking publicly about his father's fight with alcohol addiction.

Chip Somers, Focus 12's chief executive, said: ""As the cuts start to really hit, more people are going to get stressed and anxious.""

Last year Focus 12 lost its contract to provide treatment services for the Suffolk Drug & Alcohol Action Team to another charity called Open Road.

Focus 12 said it was surviving on a ""month-to-month"" basis with most of its 16 residential addiction clients being referred to it by councils from other parts of the country.

The Annexe on St John's Street has been given £28,000 in funding from an anonymous donor, which will keep it going for two years.

Clients are expected to make a payment of up to £45 for a counselling session.

Mr Somers said: ""We're well known for our addiction work, but what has been lost in that is that we see perhaps 25-30 people a week [for non-addiction issues].

""We would fit in alongside services like Mind or Relate, who are very busy, and we might be able to provide a quicker response.

Amanda Hutton 'threatened eldest son' after Hamzah Khan death,"A woman who let her four-year-old son starve to death threatened to kill her other children if her eldest son called police, a judge hears.",[],None,"Image caption The prosecution said the cause of Hamzah Khan's death was ""blindingly obvious""

A mother who allowed her four-year-old son to starve to death told his older brother not to tell anyone or she would kill his siblings, a judge has heard.

Alcoholic mother-of-eight Amanda Hutton is being sentenced for the manslaughter of her four-year-old Hamzah Khan.

His mummified remains were found in squalid conditions at their Bradford home in 2011, 21 months after he died.

The judge is hearing submissions from the prosecution and defence before he decides Hutton's sentence.

The court is also hearing details of the involvement with the family of agencies including social services and the police.

Tariq Khan, one of Hutton's two adult sons, has admitted preventing the burial of Hamzah's body and will also be sentenced later.

Packed courtroom

The judge, Roger Thomas, the Recorder of Bradford, heard Khan told police during interviews that his mother had threatened to kill her other children to prevent him from calling the authorities after Hamzah's death.

Tariq also told probation officers how his mother held a knife to the throat of one of the children two days after Hamzah's death.

He also said his mother threatened to burn down the house, the court heard.

The judge was told that one of Hutton's neighbours alerted social services to her concerns about the family in March 2011, but her actions did not result in Hamzah's body being found.

Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, said the woman had observed children crying and not being comforted, threatening voices towards the children, blinds never being open and children not playing outside.

In a text message the woman wrote about her anonymous call to social services, she wrote: ""Better to be safe than sorry.""

Mr Greaney told the judge the history of what happened after this was ""complex"", but social services, education services and the police ""were all involved to a greater or lesser extent"".

He said a serious case review into Hamzah's death was under way.

The prosecutor said whatever was or was not done by the relevant agencies ""should not detract from the shocking and disgraceful conduct of Amanda Hutton involving six of her children"".

""She killed Hamzah, no-one else,"" he said.

BBC Look North reporter Dave Edwards said the interest in the case was such that the courtroom was ""so full that security guards have been drafted in and people are being turned away"".

“I liked the idea because it had a funny side and it was easy. The response was good from the start, so we thought okay we can keep going until further notice.”

They never had to stop.

More than eight years later, the restaurant, Der Wiener Deewan, still lets customers set their own price; those who insist on a number are directed to a take-away menu with prices ranging from 4.5 to 9.5 euro ($6.12 to $12.92).

The three-room, 75-seat restaurant serves five curry dishes, rice, salad and dessert. When customers are ready to go, they pay the cashier, stating what they had to drink (alcoholic beverages and packaged soft drinks are a fixed price) and what they want to pay for the food. The philosophy is simple, Natalie explained: “They should choose based on how much they ate, how much they liked the food and how much money they have.”

Der Wiener Deewan is one of a growing number of restaurants that allow customers to choose their own price. Among them: Pay As You Please in Ireland, Lentil as Anything’s four restaurants in Australia, the Seva Cafe in India, Annalakshmi’s two restaurants in Singapore, and five Panera Cares cafes in the United States.

It might seem like a recipe for financial disaster. Why pay if you don’t have to? But the vast majority of customers do pay — a study of the restaurant by economists Gerhard Riener of the University of Dusseldorf and Christian Traxler of the Hertie School of Governance, both in Germany, found that only 0.5% of patrons didn’t pay anything for their meal.

With an average payment of 5 to 6 euro ($6.84 to $8.21) per person for food, the Deewans aren’t getting rich, but they are serving a packed house of about 500 customers a day, enabling the owners to meet their expenses, pay their 15 employees and realise an annual profit of 30,000 to 40,000 euros ($41,043 to $54,724).

“Since we have a lot of customers who are quite regular they somehow choose a fair price that keeps us running,” said Natalie.

Successes…. and failures

That’s a common theme. Pay–as-you-wish restaurants rely on their customers’ sense of goodwill and fair play to remain financially afloat. Some are successful, while others end in disappointment.

In December, the owners of the pay-what-you-wish Five Loaves and Two Fish in Fuzhou, China, announced that the venue has lost the equivalent of $41,000 since it opened last August, with an estimated 20% of customers eating for free. Several US pay-what-you-wish restaurants have shut their doors in recent years, including Terra Bite Lounge in Seattle and Santorini Grill in New York. Panera Bread has had success with its non-profit Panera Cares cafes, but the for-profit Panera Bread restaurants recently suspended a pay-what-you-wish offer on turkey chili, after a disappointing response from customers. The program, though self-sustaining, was mostly ignored by patrons.

Ayelet Gneezy, associate marketing professor at the University of California San Diego in the US, believes that cultural factors may influence a pay-what-you-wish restaurant’s success, noting that the model appears to do well in countries with high taxes and strong social welfare systems. The culture of an individual shop is also important. That may be why Panera’s chili offer failed even as the non-profit cafes have done well, she said.

“If you go into a Panera Cares cafe, you know what it’s about. When you go to a regular [Panera Bread] cafe in a mall, you don’t know what it means,” said Gneezy. “It’s not in keeping with the identity of the store, so maybe you don’t pay attention to it.”

Appealing to a higher cause is one way that many such restaurants encourage generosity. In addition to Panera Cares, the United States has several independent non-profit restaurants that employ the pay-as-you-wish model.

In Melbourne, Australia, Lentil as Anything restaurants also operate as not-for-profit enterprises that are staffed by volunteers and a smaller number modestly paid employees. There, better-off patrons are encouraged to pay a little more so that customers of lesser means can have a meal more cheaply — and the restaurant can still stay afloat. Payments are anonymous, slipped into a black box at the front of the restaurant.

Founder Shanaka Fernando said the 14-year-old establishment is self-sustaining and all of the profits go toward building more restaurants — there are now four, all in the Melbourne, Australia, metro area. The busiest Lentil As Anything, located in a former 1850s convent, serves 1,500 meals day. In addition to the chain’s 120 volunteers, the restaurants are staffed by 40 employees, though their pay (from $65 to $120 a day) is often more a stipend than a salary.

When customers take advantage

But sterling intentions don’t always guarantee success. A Lentil as Anything restaurant in a primary and secondary school canteen closed after 18 months because students didn’t respect the system; a take-away restaurant also failed to inspire generosity.

“We found that they have to feel the experience,” of sitting in the restaurant said Fernando.

The same goes for Killarney, Ireland, Pay as You Please owners Rob O’Reilly and Barry McBride, who see their share of free riders. Teenagers, in particular, can be a headache.

“They don’t know any better about the hard work that goes on in the background, so they pay 20 cents or something for loads of stuff,” said O’Reilly.

The owners responded such antics by displaying a small sign saying that customers 18 and under must be accompanied by an adult, though O’Reilly stresses that most of their teenage customers do not abuse the system and are very welcome in the restaurant.

As with Der Wiener Deewan, Pay As You Please makes up for the occasional freeloader with volume. In Killarney, a tourist town with more than 100 restaurants, media attention, word of mouth and sheer curiosity keep Pay As You Please bustling during the summer, when outdoor seating enables them to serve as many as 120 meals a day (the restaurant itself seats 25). The restaurant makes enough to provide salaries for themselves and six employees, as well as pay all the restaurant’s bills.

The restaurant gives customers a list of suggested prices and a tin can at their table in which to deposit the payment of their choice.

The loose system, O’Reilly hopes, creates a more relaxing experience for the customer, who won’t have to stress about adding extras.

“Normally, you want more cake or more coffee you’re thinking ‘All of this is going to add up to a lot.’ We wanted it to feel more like you were in someone’s house. The whole vibe is a giving vibe and hopefully they will give back.”

Alcohol limits advice 'confusing',"Using units to set out safe drinking levels is confusing, and guidance needs to be much simpler according to the head of a support charity.","['Debbie', 'Ceo Of Swanswell', 'Alcohol', 'Drug', 'Support Services']",None,"Image caption People have little 'specific' idea of how much they can drink

The advice on alcohol limits is too confusing according to Debbie Bannigan, head of the charity Swanswell. She says that 'units' mean nothing to many people - and the guidance should be clearer and easier to remember.

In this week's Scrubbing Up, she says that to have a daily ""safe"" amount is misleading and that some people - including pregnant women and drivers - should be told ""no alcohol is best"".

Most people think they have a rough idea of ""how much is too much?"", but ask them for specifics and they're not sure. Who can blame them, when the measure that is used to define safe limits - 'units' - is so hard to understand?

While 82% of adults claim to know what a unit of alcohol is, 77% don't know how many units are in a typical large glass of wine.

Ironically, 'units' become even harder to compute when we've had a drink, because the part of our brain that works that sort of thing out switches off.

And the concept of a daily safe amount may even encourage the idea that we should drink alcohol every day.

To add to the confusion, we're bombarded with new ""scientific"" findings about alcohol.

In the last couple of months alone, we've been told that alcohol damages the DNA of unborn children beyond repair, but that it's OK for pregnant women to have a couple of glasses of wine a week, which is pretty conflicting advice.

Reported health benefits from alcohol are rarely balanced with information about the risks, or the observation that the benefits can be achieved in other ways that don't carry any significant risks at all.

It's little surprise that people are confused about the impact alcohol can have on their lives.

But walk into any supermarket and you'll be encouraged to buy alcohol.

My local supermarket's ""seasonal aisle"" - one of the first things you see when you enter the store - has become a wine festival.

And the end of each aisle - the ""impulse buy"" space - is also stacked with cans of lager and cider, so selecting and purchasing alcohol is just part of the weekly shop rather than something that we have to think about doing.

Drink, anyone?

The people who come to us for help are just like you and me, but they've found that their choice to drink alcohol has been riskier than they expected.

What can be done about it? Official guidelines could be clearer. Other public health messages are short and snappy, like 'clunk-click every trip' or 'catch it bin it kill it'.

We shouldn't be afraid of setting clear guidelines and sticking to them

They are designed to be simple and memorable, so we learn and apply them without trying.

Units don't work this way, but a simple phrase like 'one or two, once or twice' gives us a simple yardstick that drinking one or two alcoholic drinks, once or twice a week, is a good limit.

Sometimes a clear, easy to understand and safe message is that no alcohol is best - for example, for children, in pregnancy or when driving.

Scientific evidence shows that even one drink can impair judgement when driving and that alcohol affects children disproportionately, especially before they are born.

A zero limit for drivers, pregnant women and children avoids confusion and helps us all to take responsibility.

We shouldn't be afraid of setting clear guidelines and sticking to them.

With co-operation between drinks manufacturers, supermarkets and the government we can judge the risk of alcohol use for ourselves.

Not only can we reach the point where hospital admissions are going down instead of up, we can create a society that is free from problem alcohol use altogether.","['alcohol', 'units', 'limits', 'simple', 'drink', 'idea', 'confusing', 'guidelines', 'safe', 'children', 'advice', 'women', 'pregnant']","Image caption People have little 'specific' idea of how much they can drinkThe advice on alcohol limits is too confusing according to Debbie Bannigan, head of the charity Swanswell.

'Have an affair' poster in Dorset criticised,A poster in Dorset for a website offering married people the chance to meet up to have an affair is criticised.,[],None,"Image caption Notes stuck on the poster claim to have found their spouses on the website

A poster in Dorset for a website offering married people the chance to have an affair has been criticised.

The advert for www.AffairsDating.net has been put up by a row of shops in Poole and near a church.

A number of residents have voiced opposition while anonymous signs have been stuck on the poster claiming to have found their spouses on the site.

Affairs Dating refused to comment but said it planned to roll out its advertising campaign nationwide.

The site, which is registered in Poole and is one of many similar on the internet, advertises to ""likeminded people who are looking to have an affair, when divorce is not an option"".

'Cheating husband'

Pastor Matthew Hosier, from the nearby Gateway Church, said: ""A marriage is meant to be faithfulness, it is meant to be fruitfulness and is meant to be living for the other person rather than yourself.

""So a website which is designed to cut against all those principles which are what the church has taught for the last 2,000 years I would see as a very negative thing.""

Image caption The owners of the website said they planned to roll out the posters nationwide

A number of notes have also appeared on the poster.

One read: ""I have just found my cheating husband on this website.""

But people who use similar sites have defended the service.

One man, who did not want to be named, said: ""My marriage is an unhappy marriage. [After] 30 years of marriage people presume you are happy and everything is wonderful but it is not.

""My wife is an alcoholic, and as I only have one life I just feel the need to go out and find women company.""

A man whose body was found by the M54 motorway more than likely knew his killer, his ex-wife has said.

Surjit Takhar, 37, was reported missing from his home in Oldbury, West Midlands, in October 2008.

His skull and other bone fragments were discovered in Telford, Shropshire, in 2015 by maintenance workers. Police are treating the death as murder.

Mr Takhar's former wife Lavina Sohl said she suspected he had been killed accidentally.

""I honestly think there is going to be a result at the end of this. Somebody will be caught for what they've done.""

Detectives said Mr Takhar's life had become chaotic. He was a divorced alcoholic. He had also run up some debts through his lifestyle at the time of his disappearance.

Det Insp Jim Munro from West Midlands Police made a fresh appeal for information with BBC Crimewatch earlier.

""On 25 January last year we had a call to the incident room from someone with specific information regarding this case - an anonymous male caller - who unfortunately was cut off before they were put through to the investigation team.

""I'm urging that person to come forward again.""

Officers also want to speak to anyone who may have information regarding the issues Mr Takhar had at the time of his death and have urged people to come forward so they can ""bring some peace"" to his family.

'Patients must not be afraid to question GP',"In this week's Scrubbing Up, Dr John Holden, senior medical adviser with UK-wide medical defence organisation MDDUS, says patients should not be afraid to ask their GP to clarify instructions on medication or treatment.","['Dr John Holden', 'Senior Medical Adviser']",None,"In this week's Scrubbing Up Dr John Holden says patients should not be afraid to ask their GP to clarify instructions on medication or treatment.

Doctors often wonder why their patients sometimes struggle to follow basic medical advice or fail to take prescriptions as instructed.

Sometimes they suspect non-compliant patients are acting irrationally or being wilfully disobedient, but often there are other factors at work.

One element that could play a significant part is simple communication failure - where doctors issue unclear or ambiguous instructions that risk being misunderstood or misinterpreted. There's no denying that patients must sometimes feel like their doctor is speaking an entirely different language.

Professor Theo Raynor and his colleagues at Leeds-based Luto Research have recently looked at this issue in relation to the wording of medicine labels. When drug information leaflets are misplaced, Professor Raynor says, the label on a particular medicine ""plays a very important part in guiding people's behaviour"".

His team's research found that the word ""drowsiness"", for example, was not always readily understood and should be replaced with the phrase: ""This medicine makes you sleepy.""

He found similar results for the instruction: ""Avoid alcoholic drink"" - where some people thought it only meant they should limit their alcohol intake - and suggested it be replaced with: ""Do not drink alcohol while taking this medicine.""

Patients should not be afraid to speak up more often and ask the doctor to explain anything.

In light of this research, the British National Formulary announced that it is recommending medicine labels should be improved ""to ensure the wording is better understood by patients"". Terminology should be simpler and more precise and changes are likely to come into force within six months.

Cause for complaint

These recommendations can be applied to more than just medicine labels. It is crucial that doctors are clear and precise when issuing any written or verbal patient instructions - particularly when giving telephone advice.

We know of a number of cases where unclear or ambiguous patient instructions have led to negative outcomes and given rise to a patient complaint.

One significant risk area relates to advice about medication.

Some patients may be given medication and told to take it ""at meal times"", but ideally this should be narrowed down to a more specific time frame, such as ""take one tablet within two hours of eating a meal"".

It can be easy for doctors, with their years of medical training, to lose sight of the fact that patients are not as familiar as they are with medical instructions.

Some patients who fail to take their medicine may simply not understand how or when to take it or, indeed, why they should take it.

Doctors have a duty to discuss their patient's condition and treatment options in a way that's easily understandable.

There can also be problems if doctors are unclear about when patients should return for further treatment.

In one case a patient with gastrointestinal problems was told by his GP to ""come back if the symptoms get worse"". His symptoms persisted over several days but, because they had not worsened, he didn't return to his GP. This resulted in a prolonged illness and the patient went on to complain about the GP.

Crystal clear

In this case, it would have been clearer if the doctor had advised the patient to come back within a given time frame if the symptoms continued or worsened. It's a simple misunderstanding but with unpleasant consequences.

The need for clarity is heightened in phone consultations, which are becoming increasingly common. The lack of face-to-face contact can make it difficult for doctors to establish if advice has been listened to and understood. Whatever the circumstances, doctors have to make sure the patient is clear about what they should do if things either do not improve or deteriorate.

Equally, patients should not be afraid to speak up more often and ask the doctor to explain anything they have not fully understood. Some patients may be reluctant to question their doctor for fear of appearing rude or perhaps because they are embarrassed to admit they are unsure of something.

But doctors have a duty to discuss their patient's condition and treatment options in a way that's easily understandable so that both parties can make decisions together. The doctor-patient relationship should be a partnership, not one-sided, and patients are perfectly entitled to ask their doctor questions or raise concerns.

Fears over 'harmful' fake alcohol on sale across the UK,"Exclusive music news, big interviews, entertainment, social media trends and video from the news people at BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra.",['Anthony Baxter'],None,"There's a warning that fake alcohol containing harmful ingredients is being sold in the UK.

The Trading Standards Institute (TSI) says people should take extra care when buying alcohol over Christmas.

Officials say they are extremely concerned about the number of fake bottles being found on sale in off-licences across the UK.

In several areas thousands of litres of illegal alcohol have been recovered in the last few months.

Symptoms of alcohol poisoning Confusion



Loss of co-ordination



Vomiting



Irregular or slow breathing



Blue-tinged or pale skin



Low body temperature (hypothermia)



Stupor (being conscious but unresponsive)



Unconsciousness (passing out)

Often the bottles contain chemicals used in cleaning products and experts fear drinking them could be lethal.

More than 2,000 counterfeit bottles were seized during one week of raids across central parts of England in November.

Similar figures have been reported following raids in other areas.

The TSI says it's difficult to work out the scale of the problem, but its chief executive Ron Gainsford says the situation is getting worse.

""We are very concerned about this trend in the availability of fake alcohol,"" he said. ""It is not just about false bargains; counterfeit spirits and wine could be lethal.""

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) says it's worried people are risking their health by trying to save money.

In some cases it's thought fake bottles of vodka cost as little as £6.

Harmful chemicals

Amy Baskerville is a student from Bristol. Last month she bought what she thought was a cheaper brand of vodka.

""My partner had drunk half of the bottle when he noticed that he wasn't getting drunk,"" she said.

""We had a sniff and normally vodka has a kick of alcohol but this just smelt like nail varnish remover.""

Our bottle of vodka had chloroform, acetone and isopropyl alcohol in it Amy Baskerville Student

The 22-year-old says they both felt ill the next day, so contacted Trading Standards, who carried out tests.

""We were told that our bottle had chloroform, acetone and isopropyl alcohol in it.

""It was a couple of pounds cheaper than more well-branded vodkas. It's surprising how you go for the cheapest thing on the shelf.""

Some of those chemicals are also found in cleaning products.

Earlier this year five men were killed in an explosion at a garage in Boston in Lincolnshire. They had been making illegal vodka.

Health experts from the county say they're worried about the number of people coming into A&E thinking they've had their drink spiked, but actually they have been poisoned by fake alcohol.

Dr Vikas Sodiwala is a consultant in emergency medicine at Lincoln County hospital.

""We are seeing many more cases of patients coming in having said that their drinks have been spiked and I do think we are seeing an increase in awareness of the illicit alcohol that's out there,"" he said.

""The worst thing is if you drink too much of this stuff, you can get kidney failure, you can get liver failure. With methanol, particularly, it can lead to permanent blindness.""

Medicine labels to be made clearer,Familiar phrases on medicine labels are likely to change after a report claimed some of them were confusing.,[],None,"Image caption About two million prescriptions are issued every day in the UK

Familiar phrases on medicine labels are likely to change after a report claimed some of them were confusing.

The study was commissioned by the British National Formulary, the textbook used by pharmacists, doctors and nurses for drug information.

It said phrases like ""avoid alcoholic drink"" could be misinterpreted and recommends ""do not drink alcohol while taking this medicine"" instead.

The changes are likely to be seen on packets and bottles within six months.

'Simple and straightforward'

The research was carried out at the University of Leeds by Theo Raynor, professor of pharmacy practice, and his colleagues.

He said: ""Most medicines do contain leaflets which provide detailed information for patients.

""However the leaflet may get lost, which means that the label on the medicine plays a very important part in guiding people's behaviour. It is vital therefore that wordings on labels are simple and straightforward.""

In taking more care about the wording of detailed instructions we can help improve the safety of medicines Nick Barber, Professor of pharmacy, University of London

They reworded phrases that people found confusing, and then retested them in several sittings, including one-to-one interviews.

Prof Raynor said ""avoid alcoholic drinks"" was a good example.

""Our user tests have shown that the word 'avoid' can cause confusion and that some people think it only means they should limit their alcohol intake.

""This phrase will now be replaced by the instruction: 'Do not drink alcohol while taking this medicine,' which is far clearer.""

Other phrases changing include ""Do not take indigestion remedies at the same time of day as this medicine"" which will become ""Do not take indigestion remedies two hours before or after you take this medicine"".

And ""Do not stop taking this medicine except on your doctor's advice"", becomes ""Warning: Do not stop taking this medicine unless your doctor tells you to stop"".

Nick Barber, professor of pharmacy at the University of London, said: ""When serious errors occur which cause harm to patients, it is often as a result of a series of minor failures at various stages.

""Therefore in taking more care about the wording of detailed instructions we can help improve the safety of medicines.

""With two million prescriptions being issued every day, a small percentage improvement through labels being more understandable could make a significant impact"".

Duncan Enright, publishing director at BNF publications, said it had never been easier to change labels on medicines given current computerised systems.

The European Court of Human Rights is expected to give a judgement later in Strasbourg on the Irish Republic's abortion laws.

A case has taken by three women, one of whom is Lithuanian, who argued that the lack of abortion facilities in Ireland breached their rights.

The Republic's abortion laws are both confused and confusing.

Way back in 1983, citizens voted to put an anti-abortion amendment into the constitution giving equal rights to life to both the mother and the unborn.

But in 1992, a suicidal 14-year-old girl, known only as X who had been raped by an older neighbour, was prevented from leaving Ireland for an abortion.

There was domestic and international uproar.

The issue went to the Supreme Court which ruled that X was constitutionally entitled to a termination because she was suicidal and there was a real and substantial threat to her life as a mother.

Indeed, it appears that X had a constitutional right to an abortion right up to the moment of birth.

Decline of influence

But since then no government has introduced enacting legislation to provide legal certainty for doctors who might be prepared to carry out a termination.

Why?

Despite the decline of influence of the Catholic Church in the wake of the many child sex-abuse cases by priests there is still an anti-abortion majority in the Republic.

All three argue that the Republic's abortion laws are unclear and they claim that the impossibility of them having an abortion in Ireland made their termination procedure unnecessarily expensive, complicated and traumatic

And politicians believe that legislation that gives the threat of suicide as a grounds for abortion would open up the floodgates for on-demand abortion.

But many legislators also suspect that as a result of the X case it's almost impossible to introduce a law that gives equal rights to both the unborn and the mother.

What's more, there is a ready-made British solution to Ireland's abortion problem.

Last year nearly 4,500 women who sought abortions in Britain gave Irish addresses.

The three women who are taking the legal challenge are among those resident in the Republic who have had British pregnancy terminations.

One of them is Lithuanian but all three want to remain anonymous.

The first is an Irish woman, a former alcoholic whose four children were put in foster care.

She claims she borrowed from a money-lender to have an abortion because she feared another child would jeopardise her chances of re-uniting her family.

The second initially feared an ectopic pregnancy but knew that wasn't the case when she travelled to Britain.

She didn't want to be a single mother.

Cancer relapse

The third was in remission from cancer and unaware that she was pregnant when she had tests.

She claims she was led to understand that her pregnancy could lead to a relapse of her cancer and couldn't get clear advice before deciding to have the termination.

All three argue that the Republic's abortion laws are unclear and they claim that the impossibility of them having an abortion in Ireland made their termination procedure unnecessarily expensive, complicated and traumatic.

They say they were humiliated and stigmatised and that their health, and in one case life, was put at risk.

There's no real expectation in government circles or in the pro-choice and pro-life pressure groups that Strasbourg will rule on the rights or wrongs of the country's abortion laws.

But it's possible that Strasbourg might criticise the 18-year delay in bringing the law and constitution into line.

If that happens, abortion as an issue could be back on the Republic's political agenda.

It's no exaggeration to say that it's almost every Irish politician's worst nightmare that the country could face a general election with the possibility of the abortion issue hovering around the campaign.","['x', 'ireland', 'termination', 'rights', 'laws', 'abortion', 'rule', 'europe', 'set', 'irish', 'strasbourg', 'women', 'case', 'republics']","Image caption The European Court of Human Rights is set to give a judgement on the Republic's abortion laws.

North Belfast booby-trap bomb was attached to bike,"A booby-trap bomb found by police on north Belfast's Antrim Road last month was attached to a child's bicycle, it has been revealed.",[],None,"Image caption Police have appealed for information about the child's bike which the bomb was attached to

A booby-trap bomb found by police on north Belfast's Antrim Road last month was attached to a child's bicycle, it has been revealed.

The bomb was the second found in the area during a security operation which lasted a number of days.

Police believe they were lured to where the first bomb was found after a window was smashed in a video shop.

Three men - all of them aged in their 30s - have been arrested and are being questioned about the attempted attack.

Detectives have released images of the bike and of a man at the video store close to the first bomb's location.

Although neither bomb exploded, the senior investigating detective said a trap had been put in place ""to kill police officers which could easily have murdered members of the public"".

Police were first called to the Xtra-Vision shop on the Antrim Road on the night of Sunday 23 January after a man damaged a window and ran off.

On the following Tuesday, following a number of anonymous warnings, officers discovered a bomb close to the shop.

""Detectives from Serious Crime Branch are following one line of enquiry that the incident of criminal damage at Xtra-Vision and the bomb alert may be connected,"" Detective Chief Inspector Justyn Galloway said.

The second device attached to the child's bike was found beside a scout hut two days later.

""We are releasing footage of the man who was seen in the vicinity of the Xtra-Vision store.

""This man may have information which is vital to the investigation. Do you know who he is? If so please contact police,"" Det Ins Galloway said.

""We are also releasing a photograph of the child's bicycle which was used to disguise the booby-trap device.

""The bicycle is quite distinctive, and our second appeal is to anyone whose child has owned such a bike and lost it or had it stolen, or anyone who has sold a bicycle similar to this privately,"" he said.

Anyone with information is asked to contact detectives at North Queen Street Police Station on 02890 561804 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Gambling in sport: John Hartson on how betting nearly cost his life,"With sportsmen three times more likely to gamble than the general population, why do so many risk so much on the 'betting buzz'?",[],1/8/2015 11:53,"There are myriad ways for people to gamble on sport in this day and age

Listen again to the full John Hartson interview in a BBC Radio 5 live Special on Gambling Addiction in Sport with Eleanor Oldroyd.

A fearless and robust striker, John Hartson's forthright response to being diagnosed with cancer came as little surprise to anybody who knew him well.

But there was one challenge ""Big John"" repeatedly shirked, his life-threatening addiction to gambling.

""You never think you've got a problem,"" he explained. ""You're a gambler, you enjoy it, you never realise the hurt you're causing.

""Your family know you're addicted, but I used to think they had the problem by questioning me.""

Then the questions stopped. Hartson's wife Sarah had had enough of him coming in from trips away, ignoring her and the children, going straight to the TV and turning on a cricket match, golf tournament or horse race he had £5,000 on.

So she packed her bags and told him she was leaving.

""I broke down and said I'd do something about this,"" the former Arsenal, West Ham and Celtic star remembered, his voice buckling with emotion and regret.

""When I was fighting for my life [with cancer], she was my rock. She was pregnant, she looked after the children, she was incredibly strong, and this scumbag here came out of hospital and carried on with the gambling, after everything she had done.

""I hit rock bottom and it takes that for you to realise - the penny dropped. I will never gamble again as long as I live.""

Hartson scored 206 goals in 505 club games in England and Scotland, and 14 in 51 games for Wales

'If I gamble again, I'll die'

Hartson's last bet was three years, three months and three days ago.

""Everybody is aware that cancer kills. It nearly took my life in 2009,"" the 39-year-old said, recalling the two emergency operations and more than 60 sessions of chemotherapy he needed when testicular cancer spread to his lungs and brain.

""Cancer takes good people away every day, but, for me, gambling also kills.

""There are four places you can end up as a compulsive gambler: out on the street, in jail, dead, or at Gamblers Anonymous (GA).

""I ended up at GA, thank the Lord, and it's not only saved my marriage and made me a better person, it's also saved my life. If I gamble again, I'll die. I'll lose everything.

""I'm ultra-determined. I don't think about gambling today. I don't buy raffle tickets, I don't buy lottery tickets, I don't go to race tracks - I go to GA twice a week.

""I'll be going until I'm 70. Why wouldn't I? It's my medicine.""

Sportsmen are three times more likely to gamble

Hartson sees a lot of different people walk through the doors of those meetings - there are an estimated 400,000 people in the UK with a problem - but most of them do not come back. They have not reached their nadir yet.

""You're very selfish as a gambler, very deceitful. Compulsive gamblers are compulsive liars - they're very good at covering things up,"" said Hartson.

So good, in fact, many can appear, swan-like, to be gliding through life, holding down jobs, living in nice houses, with loving families. And a disproportionately large group can feed this destructive addiction whilst playing professional sport.

Former Cardiff and Sunderland striker Michael Chopra estimates he lost a total of £2m gambling

Hartson's testimony came at a conference organised by the Professional Players Federation (PPF) at Edgbaston Cricket Ground last month.

An umbrella body for the players' associations in cricket, football, rugby union and other leading sports, the PPF wanted to share some research into an issue that has been the stuff of terrace legend.

From jokes about QPR maverick Stan Bowles' inability to pass a bookmaker as well as he could pass a ball, to guesstimates of how many millions golf's favourite rogue John Daly has lost in Las Vegas, the idea that sport's competitive and wealthy young men were cash machines for the gambling industry has been commonplace.

Now, thanks to a study of almost 350 cricketers and footballers, we know sportsmen are three times more likely to have a gambling problem than young men in the general population (6.1% versus 1.9%).

That equates to nearly 200 current professionals in British cricket and football with a serious issue, and another 440 ""at risk"".

The study had a few more punches to deliver. One in 10 said they gambled to ""fit in"", one in four said they were encouraged by team-mates to do it, and nearly one in three thought their team's links with the gambling industry ""encouraged"" them to bet.

For football, in particular, that should be alarming.

A quarter of the Premier League's clubs have gambling logos on their shirts, the Football League's 72 clubs play in competitions sponsored by Sky Bet, William Hill backs the Football Association and pretty much every club has its own ""official betting partner"".

The highest suicide rate of any addiction

Sporting Chance's chief executive Colin Bland revealed that seven out of 10 of the footballers that come to the Tony Adams-inspired residential clinic are there because of gambling.

But Hartson is not looking for excuses. He realises the vast majority of people gamble rarely, and when they do, they do it because it is fun.

While he may have been frittering away a reported £50,000 a week - he does not put a figure on it himself, as the amounts addicts gamble is relative to their earnings and it is always too much - his dad takes his business clients to Ffos Las racecourse once a year for champagne and £20 each-way punts. ""Not everybody gets drawn in,"" he noted.

But some who do get it bad: gambling has the highest suicide rate of any addiction.

Niall McNamee (in green, playing for Offaly) contemplated suicide when his gambling got out of hand

Sitting alongside Hartson during the conference's main session was Gaelic footballer Niall McNamee. He told a similar tale of the disease's progressive nature - moments of relief that became more fleeting as tolerance to betting's buzz builds.

But he also spoke about bad company, lies, stealing and, ultimately, despair.

""I remember waking up one morning with a knot in my stomach,"" said McNamee. ""It was the most gut-wrenching pain. I had no money to go gambling with, or to buy drink to numb the pain.

""The thought came to me that if I jumped out of the window that would end it all. It terrified me. I have had friends who have died from this addiction.""

Thankfully, this was his rock bottom, and he got help. McNamee, who is still one of the game's top forwards, is now a well-respected voice on problem gambling in Ireland, and at 29 is about to launch his own business.

'I should be living in a £4m mansion'

For Hartson, the first symptoms appeared as an 11-year-old potboy at a social club in Swansea. Fascinated by the fruit machines, he memorised the reels and was called over by the adults whenever they had a few nudges.

It sounds innocent enough, but before long he was pouring his money into those machines and begging for money for match fees at the weekend. A decade later he would have accounts with all the top bookmakers and was so consumed by gambling that he would struggle to hold a serious conversation.

Hartson is still a hero among fans of Celtic, where he scored more than 100 goals in a five-year spell

""I can concentrate now and focus on what people are saying, but five years ago I couldn't,"" he admitted. ""My life is so much better now. I'm a better husband, a better father, and I've got money coming out of my ears!""

And just as his cancer foundation is helping people deal with that affliction, he now hopes he can persuade a few footballers to think about their futures.

""I was in a lot of trouble physically and mentally when I quit,"" said Hartson, who went out with a whimper at West Brom.

""I should be living in a £4m mansion on the edge of the Vale of Glamorgan but I'm not because of all the money I wasted. I've got a nice house in Swansea, and it's paid for, but that's what I should have when you think about the money I earned.

""I would like players now to aspire to the big house.""

'We're at a tipping point'

Betting is an integral part of our culture - three quarters of the UK's adult population have gambled, most likely on the National Lottery, in the past year - and betting companies have moved into the sponsorship space vacated by tobacco and, to a lesser extent, alcohol. Without them many sports would struggle.

But listening to the speakers at the conference, it was impossible to avoid the conclusion that British sport needs to look again at its relationship with gambling.

Former Gloucestershire and New Zealand cricketer Craig Spearman said that when his gambling problem escalated, ""at times the pain and self-loathing pushed me to the brink"".

More must be done to protect the vulnerable, identify problems earlier and make sure gambling is a happy mug's game, not a debilitating illness.

Simon Barker, the assistant chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, notes that prevention through education is cheaper than emergency interventions. His counterpart at the Professional Cricketers' Association, Jason Ratcliffe, said sport was only ""scratching the surface"" in terms of what was needed.

The Responsible Gambling Trust's chief executive Marc Etches has managed to persuade the gambling industry to donate more than £6m of its profits to fund education and treatment, but he knows it is not enough.

""We're at a tipping point,"" said Etches. ""The industry needs to recognise that it's in the business of risk, and it needs to take more responsibility.""

FA crackdown on players betting on football Since the start of the 2014-15 season, the FA's new betting rules forbid players, managers, club employees and match officials to place any bet on any football matter. This includes not just domestic matches and competitions in England but any football worldwide. This does not just apply to the results of games, competitions or events that take place in them, it also covers other football events such as manager appointments and player transfers. These rules apply to bets made in person, online, on the telephone or with friends. Participants are also not allowed to instruct any third party to place any bet on their behalf.

Five Hillsborough myths dispelled by inquests jury,The alleged behaviour of fans lay at the heart of the myths rejected by the Hillsborough inquests. How were they perpetuated?,"['Richard Turner', 'Bbc News Online']",None,"Image copyright Hillsborough Inquests Image caption The alleged behaviour of fans lay at the heart of the myths rejected by the inquests

Five myths about Liverpool fans' behaviour on the day of the Hillsborough disaster were among the main obstacles for families seeking justice. What do we now know about how they were perpetuated?

The Hillsborough inquests jury concluded it was police - not fans - who caused or contributed to the deaths of 96 men, women and children who it said were unlawfully killed following a series of failures by police, the ambulance service, as well as defects in the stadium.

The behaviour of supporters, the jury said, played no part in the 1989 disaster.

The families campaigned for 27 years for the truth despite lies told by senior officers, slurs in national newspapers and an alleged police cover-up to deflect blame on to supporters.

Myth 1: Liverpool fans arrived 'late and without tickets'

After the disaster, allegations emerged from ""unnamed sources"" - later established to be a Police Federation spokesman and the Sheffield Conservative MP, Irvine Patnick - claiming Liverpool supporters had ""deliberately arrived late determined to force entry"" to the ground.

What we know: While many Liverpool supporters did arrive after 14.30, evidence to the inquests suggested it was actually the police ""failure to control the crowd"" and ""inadequate"" turnstiles that led to the fatal crush.

The claim that fans had ""deliberately arrived late"" formed the basis of the ""rock solid"" defence South Yorkshire Police [SYP] sought to present at the 1989 Taylor inquiry into the disaster. The aim was to ""deflect blame on to supporters"" and exonerate the police.

The jury heard from former South Yorkshire Police inspector Clive Davis who recalled being told by former Ch Supt Terry Wain ""to put the blame for this disaster where it belongs: on the drunken, ticketless Liverpool fans"". This was denied in evidence by Mr Wain. However, he admitted a report he prepared had exaggerated claims that ""several thousand"" spectators had arrived at the ground within minutes of kick-off.

The inquests heard the 10,100 fans with standing tickets for the Leppings Lane end were expected to enter through just seven turnstiles, causing congestion outside the ground.

Lord Justice Taylor, in his 1990 report into the disaster, concluded fans were reasonable to arrive between 14.30 and 14.40 as match tickets only requested people be in their places ""15 minutes before the game"". He was also satisfied that the large concentration of fans who gathered Leppings Lane at 14.40 to 14.50 ""did not arrive as a result of any concerted plan"".

He concluded that police had ""failed"" to prepare for controlling the arrival of a large number of fans in a short period. Both the club and police ""should have realised the turnstile area could not easily cope with the large numbers demanded of it"" unless they arrived steadily over a lengthy period.

He accepted there were ""small groups without tickets"" looking to ""exploit any chance of getting into the ground"". But the main problem was simply one of ""large numbers packed into the small area outside the turnstiles"". He stated categorically that ""fans' behaviour played no part in the disaster"".

The Hillsborough Independent Panel (HIP) report concluded crowd congestion outside the stadium was ""not caused by fans arriving late"" for the kick-off. The turnstiles, it said, were ""inadequate to process the crowd safely"" and the rate of entry insufficient to prevent a dangerous build-up outside the ground.

What the jury said: The behaviour of Liverpool supporters did not cause or contribute to the dangerous situation at the Leppings Lane turnstiles.

Myth 2: 'Drunken fans caused the disaster'

Image copyright AP Image caption Police tried to shift the blame for the disaster onto ""drunken"" fans but the inquest jury did not agree

Myth: In the days following the tragedy, some newspapers reported that a ""crazed surge"" of Liverpool fans, many the ""worse for drink, others without tickets"" had raced to the stadium causing the deaths of 96 people in the stadium. Reports quoted police witnesses describing fans as ""lager-louts"" or even as ""animals"".

What we know: The chief constable of South Yorkshire Police at the time of the Hillsborough disaster told officers if anyone was to blame it was ""drunken ticketless"" fans. The comments by Sir Peter Wright were revealed in minutes from a South Yorkshire Police Federation meeting, held four days after the 1989 tragedy.

They were read to the inquests jury during evidence from Paul Middup, who was then the federation's secretary. Mr Middup was quoted in several newspapers in the days following the 15 April 1989 disaster, claiming some supporters at the Liverpool versus Nottingham Forest match had been ""tanked up"".

A number of police officers told the inquests that fans were drinking before the match. One of them, a Sgt Lomas, said he had never before seen so much alcohol consumed before a match - ""beer, cider, wine, big bottles, cans, carafes of wine; a wide array of different drink"". Some fans were ""unsteady on their feet"", he told the jury.

The Hillsborough Inquests heard an allegation that former SYP chief inspector Sir Norman Bettison had been asked to ""concoct a story"" that ""all the Liverpool fans were drunk and that we were afraid they were going to break down the gates, so we decided to open them"". This was strongly denied by Sir Norman.

The Taylor Report, while accepting there was a ""drunken minority"" of fans, said they did not cause the congestion at the turnstiles. The coroner Sir John Goldring told the jury that more than half of the victims of the disaster had either no alcohol in their blood or an amount which was entirely negligible. Most of the others had levels ""consistent with only modest social drinking before a sporting event"".

His 1989 report said that, while many supporters who arrived at 2.30pm or after, had been drinking, the great majority ""were not drunk nor even the worse for drink"". Evidence from shops and off licences on the way to the ground ""did not suggest a great amount of alcoholic drink was bought there"".

Others described a generally normal crowd with an uncooperative minority who had drunk too much. In his view, ""many officers overestimated"" the drunken element in the crowd. He concluded that ""drunkenness played no part in the disaster"".

The HIP report found that, of the 95 individuals who died as an immediate result of the disaster, only six had alcohol levels at which they may have been expected to show ""signs of being intoxicated"". The recording of blood alcohol levels in victims and questioning of bereaved families about their drinking habits proved highly controversial and upsetting at the time.

The panel also found ""no evidence... to verify the serious allegations of exceptional levels of drunkenness, ticketlessness or violence among Liverpool fans"".

What the jury said: The jury found nothing to suggest that the behaviour of fans, drunken or otherwise, contributed to the disaster.

Myth 3: Supporters 'forced an exit gate'

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Ch Supt David Duckenfield admitted that he lied when told key people at Hillsborough that fans had ""forced a gate""

Myth: The sudden inrush of 2,000 fans which led to the fatal crushing on the terraces was caused by Liverpool fans who ""forced a gate"" to enter the stadium. This was a lie told by match commander David Duckenfield.

What we know: How so many fans entered the ground just a few minutes before kick-off lies at the centre of the Hillsborough disaster. The allegation that fans had forced their way in through exit gate C came from match commander David Duckenfield. However, he admitted at the inquests that this had been a lie.

Knowing full well that it was he who had ordered the gate to be opened, he instead told the FA Chief Executive Graham Kelly and the Sheffield Wednesday FC club secretary Graham Mackrell in the police control box that ""a gate had been forced and there had been an inrush of Liverpool supporters"". This lie was later presented to the media as the official police version of events and heavily influenced newspaper reports of the tragedy.

Giving evidence at the Hillsborough Inquests, Mr Duckenfield admitted: ""Everybody knew the truth. The fans and police knew the truth that we'd opened the gates."" The jury was asked to consider why he lied - whether it was in panic or fear of public disorder. Or because Mr Duckenfield knew his actions beforehand were responsible for the crushing in the pens. Mr Duckenfield also admitted failing to tell Mr Kelly and Mr Mackrell that it was his order to open the exit gate C - a ""lie by omission"", he told the jury.

The inquests were told that Mr Duckenfield's lie, shared in good faith with the media by the FA chief executive Graham Kelly, led to some seriously inaccurate reporting of events.

Myth 4: 'Hooliganism caused the Hillsborough disaster'

Image copyright Hillsborough Inquests Image caption Perimeter fencing was added at Hillsborough in 1977 to prevent possible pitch invasions

Myth: The fatal crush was caused by a ""crazed surge"" of Liverpool football hooligans, some newspapers reported.

What we know: Preventing and controlling crowd disorder had a ""profound effect on football"" in the 1970s and 1980s, Sir John Goldring, the coroner at the inquests stated. Four years before the disaster, a group of Liverpool fans were blamed for causing the Heysel disaster, in which 39 Juventus supporters died when a wall collapsed at the 1985 European Cup Final in Brussels. In his summing up, Sir John reminded the jury that the scourge, known as ""the English disease"", was a serious problem at the time. During the early 1970s, fighting between fans and pitch invasions made it necessary to prevent access to the playing area and the perimeter fences were erected at grounds like Hillsborough in 1977.

However, he said that Liverpool supporters ""did not have a reputation for violence"" and told jurors ""there is no suggestion that the Hillsborough disaster was caused by hooliganism"".

By the time of the 1989 semi-final, the fear of hooliganism was still a ""major problem"" and had a huge bearing both on the police planning for the match and the design of the stadium, the inquests heard. This was evident from the police Operational Order for the match which emphasised the ""prevention of disorder"" and in particular ""prevention of access to the field of play"".

The report by the Hillsborough Independent Panel said that, while safety was a concern for police, the ""prevention of hooliganism"" and ""public disorder"" was the main priority. The practice of packing the pens was ""concerned primarily with controlling the crowd"", it said. In evidence, Mr Duckenfield conceded that operational police orders placed ""more emphasis on preventing disorder than public safety"".

Lord Justice Taylor was clear in his interim report that ""hooliganism"" played no part in the 1989 disaster. On the contrary, it was the fear of hooliganism in police circles that led to ""an imbalance between the need to quell a minority of troublemakers and the need to secure the safety and comfort of the majority"".

Myth 5: Fans 'urinated on police' and 'stole from the dead'

Image copyright Hillsborough Inquests

Myth: Four days after the disaster, The Sun newspaper published its now infamous front page under the headline ""The Truth"" claiming some fans had ""picked the pockets of victims"" and had ""urinated on a woman police officer"" who was trying to help the dying. Other regional and national newspapers published similar allegations, although less prominently.

What we know: The article was based on a story filed by White's news agency in Sheffield that quoted ""unnamed officers"" as well as the Conservative MP for Sheffield Irvine Patnick. This slur on fans' behaviour originated from police inspector Gordon Sykes who, while giving evidence at the inquests, admitted sharing unfounded allegations by Hillsborough officers with Paul Middup, the secretary of the South Yorkshire Police Federation, and Mr Patnick. White's later admitted that the source of the ""unsolicited"" claims came from four ""high ranking"" SYP officers.

At the inquests, Mr Sykes accepted The Sun's story was ""unfair"" and a ""distortion"" of what happened and that he regretted sharing unfounded allegations he made about Liverpool fans pick-pocketing the dead. He told the jury he had reported what he heard in 1989 and had ""honestly believed"" the allegations were true.

Mr Sykes agreed there was a mood among the police that they were being ""blamed for the entirety of the tragedy"" and officers felt that should be ""addressed"". He also agreed with Paul Greaney QC, who represents the Police Federation, who said that mood was ""was being driven by the Chief Constable himself"".

In 2012, the former Sun editor Kelvin McKenzie apologised to the people of Liverpool for The Truth headline saying he had been ""misled"". In a statement, he said: ""These allegations were wholly untrue and were part of a concerted plot by police officers to discredit the supporters thereby shifting the blame for the tragedy from themselves.

""It would have been far more accurate had I written the headline The Lies rather than The Truth,"" he said.","['fans', 'report', 'disaster', 'inquests', 'told', 'dispelled', 'jury', 'hillsborough', 'myths', 'liverpool', 'supporters', 'mr']","Image copyright Hillsborough Inquests Image caption The alleged behaviour of fans lay at the heart of the myths rejected by the inquestsFive myths about Liverpool fans' behaviour on the day of the Hillsborough disaster were among the main obstacles for families seeking justice.
What the jury said: The behaviour of Liverpool supporters did not cause or contribute to the dangerous situation at the Leppings Lane turnstiles.
They were read to the inquests jury during evidence from Paul Middup, who was then the federation's secretary.

Barack Obama: 'Marijuana no more dangerous than alcohol',"US President Barack Obama says smoking marijuana is no more dangerous than alcohol, but still calls it a ""bad idea"".",[],None,"Image copyright AP Image caption President Obama said he views smoking pot ""as a bad habit and a vice""

US President Barack Obama has said smoking marijuana is no more dangerous than alcohol, but still called it a ""bad idea"".

Speaking to The New Yorker magazine, he said it was wrong to think legalising the drug would be ""a panacea"" that could solve many social problems.

Mr Obama was referring to recent legalisation of marijuana in the states of Colorado and Washington.

He has previously admitted using the drug when he was young.

""As has been well documented, I smoked pot as a kid, and I view it as a bad habit and a vice, not very different from the cigarettes that I smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life,"" Mr Obama said.

But he added that in terms of its impact on the individual consumer ""I don't think it is more dangerous than alcohol"".

He also said that poor people - many of them African Americans and Latinos - were disproportionately punished for marijuana use, whereas middle-class users mostly escaped harsh penalties.

""It's important for society not to have a situation in which a large portion of people have at one time or another broken the law and only a select few get punished.""

Mr Obama described the legalisation of marijuana in Colorado and Washington as a challenging ""experiment"".

Colorado's law went into effect on 1 January, while Washington is expected to allow the drug's sale later this year.","['think', 'alcohol', 'bad', 'obama', 'smoking', 'pot', 'barack', 'legalisation', 'marijuana', 'smoked', 'dangerous', 'president', 'washington']","Image copyright AP Image caption President Obama said he views smoking pot ""as a bad habit and a vice""US President Barack Obama has said smoking marijuana is no more dangerous than alcohol, but still called it a ""bad idea"".

An author has tracked down the English teacher who supported him 40 years ago when his mother died thanks to a mass social media search.

Chris Young appealed on Twitter to help find Lyn Ward, who taught at Lodge Park School in Corby in 1978.

Miss Ward was found via Mr Young's former music teacher Gill Manning and with the help of 30,000 retweets and responses to his search.

Mr Young, 52, said it was ""like meeting one of your childhood heroes"".

Mr Young said: ""I don't have the words to describe how I feel. I'm so incredibly thrilled and excited. It's like meeting one of your childhood heroes.""

He was 12 when his mother died and his alcoholic father was unable to cope.

He said Miss Ward ""treated me like a rock star, loved what I wrote and got me to talk in front of the class"" and he moved from the bottom quarter to fourth in the year.

Mr Young's quest to find her saw teachers at the school ""firing off emails in the hope one would land"" to former staff.

Miss Manning said she had a phone number and address for her, but the number turned out to be wrong.

But it was not over then as the address proved to be correct and Miss Ward, who has since changed her name and wishes to remain anonymous, contacted Mr Young on email last week.

He said: ""She was gobsmacked and swept away by it all.

""The phrase that summed it up for me was that she felt she was the cat that got the cream.

""I never lost hope [of finding her] because the effect this lovely woman had on my life had already been made.""

随身英语 / Can AI save us from bad meetings? 人工智能给糟糕的会议画上句号？,Could AI make our meetings better?,[],None,"会议是许多企业和公司的常规组成部分。但很多人认为会议是耗时、枯燥和无效的。有理论证实，人工智能可能是帮助人们组织更好、更高效的会议的答案。人工智能是怎么办到的？本集《随身英语》讨论人工智能是否能给商务会议注入新活力。

Vocabulary: business meetings 词汇: 商务会议

Business meetings are, arguably, a necessary part of any organisation where people work collectively to accomplish a goal. But badly managed, meetings can be unproductive, boring and feel like a complete waste of time. In a recent survey conducted by governance technology firm eShare, it was found that the average UK employee spends over 10 hours weekly preparing for and attending meetings – approximately 50% of which they consider unnecessary. However, there are theories that technology could improve things.

It's ""very feasible"" for an AI to be able to recognise when one person is hijacking a meeting, or if a circular discussion keeps returning to a single issue, says James Campanini, from videoconferencing company, BlueJeans. ""If no new points are made after a while, the AI could suggest to wrap up,"" says Cynthia Rudin, a computer science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But AI isn’t quite there yet.

""If AI can do most of the mundane and drudgery work during business meetings, that leaves more space for humans to think about strategy and vision,"" believes Niki Iliadis at the Big Innovation centre, London, an innovation hub in AI. This seems to be true. The prefecture of Osaka in Japan started using an AI as a minute taker to transcribe and summarise the 450 annual cabinet meetings. It has halved the time needed to produce summaries and cut staff overtime, claims the prefecture.

AI can also help with the matter of attendance. If a meeting with irrelevant subject matter is called, or if it's an an inconvenient time, an AI could be used to decide who should attend the meeting and when it should be, says Elise Keith from Lucid Meetings, a US-based meeting management platform.

Finally, one Stockholm start-up, Mentimeter, allows meeting attendees to give anonymous feedback about a discussion. Using the software, participants can make open-ended responses, submit comments or vote in multiple-choice quizzes. This has ""fundamentally changed the dynamics of a presentation,"" says Austin Broad from financial services firm AFH Wealth Management.

While tools that can create agendas, send meeting invitations, distribute the minutes, and keep track of action items should improve effectiveness, they are still in development. Let's hope that if or when they do arrive, they will meet our expectations.

Smart meters: Privacy warning over personal data,A privacy watchdog says it will be keeping a close eye on energy companies over personal data held on smart meters.,"['Kevin Peachey', 'Personal Finance Reporter', 'Bbc News']",None,"Image caption Old-style meters could be phased out by 2020

A watchdog has said it will keep a close eye on energy companies over personal data held on smart meters.

The devices, which show exactly how much gas and electricity is being used in a household, could contain a raft of private information.

Every home in Britain is expected to be equipped with a smart meter by 2020 and the Information Commissioner's Office warned privacy must not be compromised.

The industry said that it was addressing security concerns.

Energy plans

The new coalition government has said that it is committed to the roll-out of smart meters.

Under the plans, each home would get a new smart gas meter and a new electricity meter. One is the ""host"" meter, that will communicate with the customer and the supplier.

This should bring an end to estimated bills, because the technology sends back an accurate meter reading to the energy company every day.

However, various security concerns have been raised regarding the technology. This includes the amount of personal data held on the devices.

It also means that it could make clear the exact times householders tend to leave their home, or when they sleep, by looking at their energy usage.

Energy company First Utility recently announced a link-up with Google, that would allow people to check their energy usage via the internet and mobile phone.

First Utility boss Mark Daeche said that data was encrypted, but that the government needed to ensure standards of privacy were set.

He said there should be ""no loopholes"" and that information should be ""secure and anonymous"".

Security concerns

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which monitors personal data security, said that it had already met major suppliers to discuss the security implications of smart meters.

Image caption Electricity monitors can be used to check usage

""We will continue to maintain a close dialogue to ensure that their introduction does not compromise customers' privacy. Important issues include what information is stored on the meters themselves, in particular whether information identifying the householder will be held,"" an ICO spokesman said.

""In any event energy companies will clearly need to hold records linking meters with householders and all the information must be held in line with the requirements of the Data Protection Act. The industry recognises the need to address these matters properly.""

Christine McGourty, the director of Energy UK, which represents the big energy suppliers, said: ""The industry is well aware of the potential security concerns that smart meters present.

""Their customers' security is a key priority and every effort is being made to ensure that any security issues have been identified and resolved before the mass roll out of smart meters begins. All information will be handled strictly in accordance with the Data Protection Act.""

Display

More information is also expected soon on the functionality of smart meters.

First Utility's Mr Daeche argued that there should be no requirement for a screen on each smart meter that displays how much energy has been used. He said many people would access this information on their mobiles.

The big energy companies have said that they will offer the option of a digital display unit on every smart meter.

The Man in the High Castle: What if the Nazis had won?,"The new show follows a long tradition of alternate-history stories – from the Roman historian Livy to television, where the speculative genre most resonated, writes Keith Uhlich.",['Keith Uhlich'],11/26/2015 0:00,"What if?

That simple question has inspired a great number of artists to imagine scenarios in which the world as we know it is no longer the world as we know it.

It's what made the Roman historian Livy ponder, in his Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Books Of the Founding of the City), what might have happened if Alexander the Great had expanded his empire west instead of east. It gave shape to the plight of the hero in Nathaniel Hawthorne's short story P's Correspondence. who perceives the year 1845 as a time in which long-dead politicians and poets still live.

It's one of the principal motivating queries for It's a Wonderful Life's George Bailey, who is given glimpses of a lifeless world in which he was never born. And it's the theme of Philip K Dick's novel The Man in the High Castle, which imagines a universe in which the Nazis and the Japanese won World War Two and divided the American spoils.

Just put a swastika in place of the stars on the American flag and you’re certain to get chills

A TV adaptation of Dick's book from former X-Files writer Frank Spotnitz premiered in the US on Amazon on 20 November. (The pilot, which aired last year, was one of the highest-rated and viewed in the streaming service's history.) And it certainly goes all-out in depicting a world off its axis. The money shot, which comes early in the first episode, follows square-jawed double-agent Joe Blake (Luke Kleintank) through a Times Square covered in fascist iconography. Just put a swastika in place of both the stars on the US flag and the Coca-Cola neon sign and you’re certain to get chills - and controversy: last week New York mayor Bill de Blasio ordered posters advertising the series to be removed from the city's trains.

The series reworks Dick's spare, suggestive and open-ended novel in a number of intriguing if not always successful ways. And watching all 10 episodes of the series' engrossing, though flawed, first season got me thinking about some of the best ‘What if?’ stories on television. Alternate history stories have found a particularly welcoming home on the small screen.

The mirror crack’d

Look first, unsurprisingly, to the original Twilight Zone, which aired an episode in early 1963 called The Parallel, in which an astronaut in orbit inexplicably finds himself on an alternate Earth. The changes around him are mostly minute (a white picket fence where one never was), with the most epochal variation being that John F Kennedy never became president.

But it's these little differences that drive the protagonist crazy. Humans can't help but crave the familiar, and though the astronaut eventually ends up back on his own Earth, it's with a twist: An alternate-universe version of himself has apparently followed him back.

The Van Dyke beard on the alternate universe variant of Leonard Nimoy's Mr Spock is the episode's scariest conceit

Creepy. And is it any wonder that many other sci-fi-centric shows followed suit with alternate universe stories of their own? Almost all of the Star Trek series made use of the mirror universe plotline from the 1960s show, in which the beloved characters on the Starship Enterprise faced off with their evil counterparts from a parallel reality.

It first appeared in the 1967 episode Mirror, Mirror, in which a transporter malfunction swaps several members of the Enterprise we know with their more sadistic mirror universe doppelgangers. (The Van Dyke beard on the alternate universe variant of Leonard Nimoy's Mr Spock is the episode's scariest conceit.) After things are finally set right, Spock mentions to Captain Kirk (William Shatner) how refreshingly human those doppelgangers seemed, suggesting that our ‘good’ side can be as much of a mask as our ‘evil’ one. Who’s to say the world we know best is necessarily better than any other?

Sometimes alternate realities come in the form of premonitions; characters get a view of how things might be if the world continues on its current course. Among the few lesser-known works by massively influential film-maker Steven Spielberg is his episode of the '70s anthology TV series The Name of the Game, entitled LA 2017.

In it, a book publisher played by Gene Barry blacks out after crashing his car in the Hollywood hills and wakes up to find himself in a desolate world where humans have been driven underground due to pollution. If the environment above ground is toxic, the situation below is much worse, as the surviving populace is at the mercy of a corporatised fascist government.

Like much dystopic fiction, the episode is more about the evanescent fears of the current moment made tactile. Barry's character eventually escapes the nightmare – it's proven to be a literal dream. Yet the image that lingers most is not any of the future visions of anonymous steel structures and a militarised police force, but that of a dead bird lying by the side of the road in the present, an omen of a blasted wasteland that could still be made from humanity's own war on mother earth.

Be careful what you wish for

The Spotnitz-produced X-Files often dipped its toe into alternate universe fiction, one of the best examples of which finds hilarious form in the Season 7 episode Je Souhaite. FBI agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) discovers a wisecracking genie wrapped in a carpet and wishes for ""world peace"". But his good intentions blind him to the literalness of the request. When he steps outside every human being on Earth except for him has vanished, and all the noise pollution with them. Well…it's certainly more peaceful.

Viewers probably didn't expect pathos-ridden alternate universe fiction from an Adult Swim cartoon. But midway through the first season of the often hilariously ribald animated sci-fi series Rick and Morty came the game-changing Rick Potion No 9. Written by series creator Justin Roiland – who also voices both protagonists, alcoholic mad scientist Rick and his awkward teenage grandson Morty – the episode begins like almost any other.

At Morty's irritating insistence, Rick invents a love potion that the high schooler can use on the girl for whom he has a crush. Unfortunately, she has the flu, so the serum quickly spreads like a virus between students, teachers, and the world at large until literally everyone loves Morty.

Rick's attempts to make an antidote result in almost everyone in the population turning into mantis-people (just go with it), which forces the duo to escape to an alternate reality. There, they discover alterna-world versions of themselves who have died in an explosion in Rick's garage. So they bury the bodies in the backyard and resume their lives, though the cognitive dissonance is almost too much for Morty to take.

The horrified look on his face as he walks through this familiar home that isn't truly his is devastating, and it marked the moment when a seemingly silly series proved it could do serious with the best of them. And that’s the thing about alternate-history stories: they’re usually reflections of our own fears, or the fears that inevitably result when our “what if?” daydreams or taken to their logical, and usually unsatisfactory, conclusions.

We start to doubt the concreteness, and even the moral rightness, of our own reality

Perhaps that’s what sets The Man in the High Castle apart. It's outwardly true to Dick's universe, with its rocket ships that jet between Berlin and New York in record time and its vision of the United States as a country both literally and spiritually divided. Yet the demands of an ongoing television series force some necessary changes that tend to take some of the edge off the novel's pointedness.

One of Dick's central motifs is of a book-within-the-book written by the eponymous character. It's called The Grasshopper Lies Heavy, and describes an alternate reality very close to our own where the Allied powers won WWII. It gives the act of reading Dick's book a hall-of-mirrors effect where we start to doubt the concreteness, and even the moral rightness, of our own reality.

In the series, the book within has been changed to a film within. The Grasshopper Lies Heavy is now a series of newsreels – purportedly created by the title character, who never makes an appearance in this first season – that show an alternate reality in which the US triumphs as it should. As the season goes on, it's hinted that the films are actually Rorschach blots of a sort that show each viewer what they want to see. It’s as if, as we’re watching these characters struggle in a world sprung from our own nightmares, they’re looking back at us too.

More over 65s in London 'seek drink problem help',"There has been a sharp rise in the number of people aged over 65 being treated for drinking problems in London, new figures suggest.",[],None,"There has been a sharp rise in the number of people aged over 65 being treated for drinking problems in London, figures suggest.

Figures compiled for BBC Inside Out London by the NHS Information Centre reveal over the past 10 years, there has been a 163% increase in alcohol-related hospital admissions for the over-65s.

The rate is rising faster for the over-65s than any other age group in the UK, and only north-east England has a higher rate of these admissions than London.

Older people are much more likely to drink every day than those of other ages, according to an NHS study into alcohol use.

While the rest of the population is drinking slightly less, and slightly less often on average, this is not the case for older people, it said.

Prof Tony Rao, from the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych), said: ""London is a bit of a pressure point.

""Within London there are areas like Hammersmith and Fulham, Southwark and Camden with even higher rates of death [than the rest of England] from alcohol-related illnesses.""

The RCPsych claims GPs are missing the problems of elderly drinkers through a combination of time constraints, lack of expertise and the reluctance of older people to ask for help.

You don't tend to see a retired 70-year-old bank manager vomiting in the street Dr Claire Gerado, Chair of Royal College of GPs

Dr Claire Gerado, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said: ""I think we focus far too much on the young ones.

""We do that because the young ones are more visible - they vomit in streets. You don't tend to see a retired 70-year-old bank manager vomiting in the street.

""But it's just as much of a problem for people drinking at the other end of life as it is for the young ones.""

NHS research has found older drinkers often regard excessive drinking problems as a taboo subject.

They may also think it is too late to get help, that services are not designed for them, or they may think that they do not have a problem in the first place.

'Never an issue'

Health experts cite a range of reasons for older people drinking heavily including boredom, loneliness, change in lifestyle - usually retirement, bereavement and as a form of self-medication.

But there are very few services which offer specific support for elderly drinkers.

One of the few to target work specifically with older people in London is the charity Foundation 66, which has seen an increasing number of senior citizens seeking help.

I think I just stopped in time, because it was getting to the stage where I was not recovering. I couldn't get off [the] floor Recovering alcoholic

The charity's Sean Dudley said: ""It's interesting that 40% of people who are accessing our service have never accessed an alcohol service previously.

""For them, drinking became problematic probably in their late-40s, their 50s and 60s, whereas previously it was never an issue.""

One Hammersmith resident, who wishes to remain anonymous, is in recovery for a drinking problem that started relatively late in her life.

""I didn't drink hardly at all before the age of 60, just sherry maybe, but then I just took off,"" she said.

""I had lots and lots of upsets with the family, they just couldn't cope and hadn't seen me drinking before - it was out of control, completely out of control.

""I had time on my hands, I met other people who liked a drink and I continued when I went home.

""I think I just stopped in time, because it was getting to the stage where I was not recovering. I couldn't get off [the] floor.""

She is now in recovery for her alcoholism at a centre run by Foundation 66.

Serial killer trial priest 'raped schoolgirl 40 times',An alleged victim of the late Father Gerry Nugent claims she was targeted over a two-year period.,"['Lucy Adams', 'Bbc Scotland Correspondent']",None,"Image caption Father Gerry Nugent was the priest at the church where Angelika Kluk's body was found

A disgraced Roman Catholic priest has been accused of raping a schoolgirl up to 40 times over a two-year period.

Father Gerry Nugent was shamed in 2007 when he admitted to a murder trial he had sex with student Angelika Kluk, a victim of serial killer Peter Tobin.

Police Scotland have now confirmed they are investigating historical allegations of child sexual abuse against the priest, who died in 2010.

The Catholic Church said it was ""truly sorry"" for what happened decades ago.

The church said it now had a ""dramatically different awareness of child protection issues"".

It said Fr Nugent was ""removed from parish ministry"" as soon as the extent of his inappropriate sexual behaviour with adults became apparent in 2007 and that ""allegations relating to minors only emerged after his removal"".

Image caption Angelika Kluk was murdered in September 2006

The BBC has spoken to a 51-year-old woman, who we are calling Teresa, who said that Fr Nugent raped her repeatedly when she was 13.

She is seeking damages from the Catholic Church.

Teresa said Fr Nugent had been close to her grandmother, with whom she lived in the west end of Glasgow.

She said: ""He was a very dear friend to gran and because I loved her so much and I could see their relationship made her happy I always felt happy, confident, comfortable in his presence.""

But she went on to describe a sinister pattern of behaviour by Fr Nugent which progressed from holding her hand to stroking her.

Teresa added: ""Eventually, around the time of my 13th birthday, he raped me and continued to do so for two years on a regular basis.

""I loved him very much so I thought that this behaviour was normal in families because that is what he told me.""

Teresa claimed Fr Nugent, who was often under the influence of alcohol, first raped her in the flat where she lived with her grandmother.

She also claimed he would sexually assault her in the stairwell of the building.

Teresa said: ""It happened in an motorway underpass on a couple of occasions and quite often it would happen when we were just walking down the street.

""He never seemed at all concerned that a priest would be a walking down the road while having his hand on the bottom of an obviously very young girl.""

Image caption Fr Nugent was a priest at St Patrick's Church in Anderston, Glasgow

Asked how many times it happened, Teresa replied: ""Actual rape?

""I think somewhere in the region of 30 and 40 times in total.""

The mother-of-four claims the abuse stopped when she was 15 after her grandmother died from a massive brain haemorrhage.

Around this time she discovered she was not Fr Nugent's only alleged victim.

After Teresa confided in a friend, she told her: ""I know. This is what he has been doing to me.""

These allegations are also being investigated by Police Scotland.

Both women are being represented by Thompsons Solicitors.

A Glasgow law firm is also thought to be speaking to a third victim.

Public apology

Teresa has suffered anxiety and depression throughout her adult life and has undergone therapy.

Her relationship with her husband also broke down.

She said: ""There hasn't been a single aspect of my life that it hasn't affected and I haven't always been conscious of that.""

In 2015 she approached the Catholic Church about her experiences.

Theresa said she met safeguarding staff at the Archdiocese of Glasgow and Archbishop Philip Tartaglia, whom she thanked for his public apology.

But she claimed ""the shutters came down"" after she threatened legal action.

Theresa believes there are more alleged victims of Fr Nugent and urged them to come forward.

She added: ""These acts are historical but the effects are not historical.

""They are affecting people every single day.""

Image caption Peter Tobin, the man who murdered Angelika Kluk, was later unmasked as a serial killer

Fr Nugent hit the headlines in September 2006 after the mutilated body of 23-year-old Angelika Kluk was found under the floorboards of St Patrick's Church in the Anderston area of Glasgow.

Serial killer Peter Tobin had been working there as a church handyman, under an assumed name.

Tobin was eventually convicted of the murder, but during the trial Fr Nugent admitted he was in a sexual relationship with Angelika.

The Dublin-born priest, who was forced to resign from his post, said he felt ""shame"" and ""disgust"" with himself and admitted he had abused the position of trust he was in.

The self-confessed alcoholic was also found guilty of contempt of court because he did not give straight answers in the witness box during the trial.

At the time, the Catholic Church issued an apology over the priest's behaviour.

He died in January 2010, aged 66, after a suspected heart attack.

'Sincere and heartfelt'

Last year a long-standing time bar which prevented victims of childhood abuse seeking civil legal action was lifted.

The Catholic Church confirmed it is aware of complaints against Fr Nugent dating back to the 1970s.

A church spokesman said: ""Allegations have been made by women that they were sexually assaulted by the late Fr Gerry Nugent when they were children, some around 40 years ago.

""The crimes described in these allegations are appalling.

""The Church, its bishops, priests and people are truly sorry for what has happened.

""The Archbishop has met the survivor interviewed by the BBC and apologised in person and on behalf of the Church for what she has gone through.

""That apology is sincere and heartfelt and is extended to anyone who suffered at the hands of Fr Nugent or any other representative of the Church.""

Appeal for 'victims'

The church confirmed no allegations of child abuse until after Fr Nugent was removed from his ministry.

In 1995 he was sent for ""psychological assessment"" and therapy following an anonymous allegation he engaged in ""inappropriate sexual conduct with an adult"".

But the spokesman added: ""The assessment did not flag any issues with his sexual conduct, but highlighted alcohol abuse as a cause for concern.

""It may be that no-one will ever know the full truth of all Fr Nugent's wrongful conduct and criminal actions, but the Church remains ready and willing to co-operate with the police and statutory authorities to assist survivors.

""The Church offers ongoing counselling to those affected and will also co-operate fully should they engage legal representation to seek financial recompense.""

Teresa's lawyer Alan Rodgers said: ""What we really want to do is take her case forward and give other people the inspiration and courage to come forward if they have been through similar experiences so that we can also try to obtain answers for them.""

Drug users in Scotland 'consume most cocaine' in one session,"A survey finds Scots use more of the drug per session - and in Glasgow can order it ""quicker than pizza'"".",[],None,"Image copyright Getty Images

Drug users in Scotland consume the most cocaine in a single session, according to a worldwide survey of drug-taking habits.

The 2018 Global Drug Survey looked at the recreational drug use of 130,000 people across 44 countries.

In Scotland the amount of the drug consumed per session was more than double the global average.

Researchers, who quizzed 15,000 cocaine users, said the drug can be delivered ""more quickly than a pizza"" in Glasgow.

The survey, which is self-selecting and conducted anonymously, found 36.7% of users in the city reported delivery of the drug ""within 30 minutes"".

For users in England that figure rises slightly to 36.8% - placing them fifth in the world rankings.

Scots were found on average to consume 1.2g of cocaine in a single session, signifcantly higher than both the figure in England (0.7g) and the worldwide average (0.5g).

Some drugs experts have suggested cocaine in Scotland might be less pure.

Image copyright PA Image caption Scotland also fared badly in the survey when it came to problem drinking

The survey also looked at alcohol use, and found Scotland had the highest proportion of respondents (4.2%) who sought emergency medical care after a drinking session.

The report said: ""This is double the level of English drinkers seeking medical treatment after drinking (2.1%), highlighting how entrenched a problem drinking is north of the border.""

Prof Adam Winstock, consultant psychiatrist and addiction medicine specialist, and founder of the survey, said: ""The 2018 Global Drug Survey highlights how much more work there is to do with alcohol messaging in the UK.

""It is clear that the link between alcohol consumption and increased cancer risk is a message that is still not reaching UK drinkers and where it does, many chose to react to the message with scepticism.

He said the regularity of people ending up in accident and emergency departments was ""truly alarming"".

Prof Winstock added: ""That both England and Scotland are in the top five global nations needing emergency treatment after alcohol consumption is truly concerning.

""This is another finding that shows how much more work is required to drive home the message of responsible drinking.""

Bulking agents

Katy MacLeod of Scottish Drugs Forum said the true weight of a drug sold as a ""gram"" can vary and seems to be lower in Scotland than elsewhere.

She said: ""The low purity of cocaine supplied in Scotland suggests that bulking agents have been used to dilute the drug and so the same weight in Scotland will have less cocaine than in other countries.

""Using with alcohol may mean that people are using cocaine to allow them to keep drinking alcohol and so it is alcohol that is driving this behaviour.

Students fight universities' inaction on sexual assault,"Allegations of sexual assault have intensified at Ivy league schools. Now students, schools and the government are trying to fight back.","['Barbara Plett Usher', 'Bbc News', 'Cambridge']",None,"Image caption At Harvard commencement, students adorned their caps with red tape in protest

Allegations of sexual assault have intensified at Ivy League schools. Now students, schools and the government are trying to fight back.

During commencement week, Harvard tours are top-heavy with proud parents and hopefuls seeking information on admission to this venerated realm of elite education.

Historically it's also a bastion of male dominance. The tour guide chronicles the long battle for gender equality: women were first admitted in 1879, but ""we like to call 1999 the official end of sexism"".

That's when men and women finally got the same diplomas. The university now has a female president and, four years ago for the first time, the graduating class had more women than men.

But if assuming they compare with the national average, one-fifth of them were sexually assaulted in some way while they were students. And this university is one of dozens that has been called to task for how poorly it has handled complaints.

""The trauma imparted by the process was much too close to the trauma caused by the actual assault,"" says former Harvard student Madeleine Smith.

Image caption Madeleine Smith spoke at a White House summit on sexual violence on campus

Rape 'derailed everything'

She filed a rape case against her ex-boyfriend through the university's adjudicatory system. What should have taken two months stretched to seven, during which time he continued to live in her residence building.

""It was terrible,"" she says, ""it derailed everything, my academics were much harder.""

Madeleine told her story at the launch of a White House report on college sexual violence, describing what it was like to sit ""in a room of Harvard professors as they look at a magnified photo of your backside covered in bruises and broken blood-vessels, because those are the personal moments that no-one ever talks about.""

The White House has named 55 colleges and universities under investigation for mishandling sexual assault complaints. Besides Harvard the list also includes other Ivy League institutions such as Princeton and Dartmouth, as well as schools like Florida State and the Pennsylvania State University.

Emily Fox-Penner belongs to a group called Our Harvard Can Do Better. She has filed a formal complaint against the university with the government, citing a law prohibiting gender discrimination at universities known as Title IX.

In 2011, the Obama administration put colleges on notice that Title IX could be used to hold them accountable on sexual assault cases, which triggered a number of lawsuits and helped build a formidable student lobby.

Harvard activists have a long list of demands for reform, but one of the priorities is changing the university's definition of consent, to a clear ""yes.""

At the moment, if a woman doesn't say no or physically resist, the university is less likely to view the incident as rape, says Ms Fox-Penner, especially where alcohol is involved.

""One thing that gets overlooked is that alcohol is often used as a weapon against potential victims on campus,"" she says, ""especially when you're looking at often male-controlled party spaces that are dispensing alcohol to maybe freshmen.""

The following day Ms Fox-Penner and other members of her group are dispensing rolls of red tape. It's the eve of commencement and they're planning a demonstration for the ceremony.

The idea is to get graduating students to put red tape on their caps to show solidarity with rape survivors.

""We're using red tape to show that we are not going to stand for the bureaucracy they present us when we as students want to make Harvard a better place, "" says Pearl, a Harvard senior.

Senate pressure

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Julia Dixon has filed a complaint against her university for the way it handled her sexual assault case.

In fact Harvard is taking action.

The university has hired a Title IX officer and prepared a new policy on sexual assault that is being reviewed by the government. Recently it set up a task force on prevention. This ""will significantly enhance how Harvard responds to incidents of sexual misconduct"", it said in a statement.

The university refused BBC requests for an official interview.

In the meantime, pressure is growing not only from the White House but Capitol Hill, where senators such as Claire McCaskill have begun drafting legislation.

At a recent forum, participants tackled the issue of penalties for student rapists, who are occasionally suspended, very rarely expelled.

""I know the vast majority of these perpetrators aren't even getting a criminal interview,"" Ms McCaskill said, as she heard that rape survivors still don't feel safe, even though they are filing cases and speaking out. ""We aren't going to get any meaningful deterrent on this problem until that begins happening.""

A graphic reminder of the problem jolted Harvard in March when the campus newspaper published a letter from an assault victim, nearly a year after the university initiated its reforms.

Entitled Dear Harvard: You Win, the anonymous woman graphically described her trauma at failing to get her assailant removed from their shared residence, and said Harvard's ""out-dated and narrow"" policy discouraged her from even filing a case.

""Dear Harvard, I am writing to let you know that I give up. I will be moving out of my House next semester, if only - quite literally - to save my life.""

It was a disturbing and compelling voice, one amongst a growing number that cannot be ignored.","['harvard', 'red', 'inaction', 'students', 'assault', 'rape', 'fight', 'sexual', 'universities', 'tape', 'university', 'house', 'white']","Image caption At Harvard commencement, students adorned their caps with red tape in protestAllegations of sexual assault have intensified at Ivy League schools.

Hamzah Khan: Children's Minister highlights 'glaring absences',"The children's minister highlights 10 ""glaring absences"" from the serious case review into the death of Hamzah Khan.",[],None,"Image caption Hamzah Khan was deprived of food and drink over a period of years by his alcoholic mother

A report into the death of four-year-old Hamzah Khan has been strongly criticised by Children's Minister Edward Timpson.

He highlighted 10 ""glaring absences"" from the serious case review carried out after Hamzah's death.

In a letter to Prof Nick Frost, the independent chairman of the Bradford Safeguarding Children Board, he said he had ""deep concerns"" over the review.

Below is an abridged version of the 10 points raised in Mr Timpson's letter.

'Domestic violence'

December 2006

One of Hamzah Khan's siblings spoke to the police about domestic violence at home and the police referred him to children's social care. The child returned home.

Was the child assessed? If not, why not?

'Foster carers'

March 2007

One of Hamzah Khan's siblings was remanded by magistrates and placed with foster carers for two nights, then returned home.

Was the child assessed by children's social care? If not, why not?

'Running away from father'

Image caption Hamzah Khan's father Aftab said he was ""pushed to one side"" by the police and social services

May 2007

The child who appeared before magistrates was injured while running away from his father.

While in hospital he requested help to live away from his family and was referred to children's social care.

He was given emergency accommodation but returned home by the end of May.

The review says that a statutory assessment could have been expected at this point. Was the child assessed? If not, why not?

'Under the influence of an unknown substance'

April 2009

Three of the Khan children were not collected from primary school.

Following a welfare visit, police reported to children's social care that there were insufficient beds for at least one of the children in the house and the mother appeared to be under the influence of an unknown substance.

The serious case review says that a statutory assessment could have been expected at this point.

Why was no assessment undertaken?

'Difficulties seeing the children'

Late 2010

Image caption During Hutton's trial, the court heard of the ""breathtakingly awful"" conditions she lived in

The review refers to ""correspondence"" between health visitors, education, early childhood services and children's social care ""which centred on the difficulties in seeing the children"".

This was followed by reports (it is unclear from whom) that some of the children were living outside Bradford.

What action did children's social care take at this point?

'Physically neglected'

January 2011

The school attended by one of Hamzah Khan's siblings in Year 8 reported to children's social care that attendance had fallen to 51% and apparently (it is not clear from the serious case review) reported that the child appeared physically neglected.

Children's social care decided this was a school attendance issue and declined to assess. Why?

'Anonymous referral'

March 2011

An anonymous report was made to police of shouting and swearing at children.

Why did children's social care rely on the education social network report that concerns did not appear substantiated as the younger children had been ""placed in Portsmouth"". Why did they undertake no further inquiries of their own?

'Invisible'

Mr Timpson states that the serious case review alludes to ""the extent to which Hamzah was unknown and invisible to services throughout his short life"".

The review makes clear that local agencies had concerns about the poor attendance of some of Hamzah's siblings.

What actions were taken, and when, to establish the causes of this?

What, if any, consideration was given to the possibility of neglectful parenting being a factor in low attendance?

'Not registered with a GP'

The review refers to attempts ""to establish the whereabouts of the three youngest children after the health visitor initially identified that Hamzah was not registered with a GP"".

What form did these attempts take? Given that the children did not appear to have left Bradford, what prevented the children's whereabouts being established quickly?

Visits to children's home

The serious case review refers to children's social care making a number of visits to the children's home.

What were the outcomes of these visits,? Did conversations take place with the children and was there any follow up?

If no action was taken, why not?","['khan', 'highlights', 'glaring', 'absences', 'hamzah', 'childrens', 'care', 'social', 'minister', 'review', 'children', 'case', 'child', 'khans', 'serious']","He highlighted 10 ""glaring absences"" from the serious case review carried out after Hamzah's death.

Gun concerns: Why doctors should not always speak out,"In this week's Scrubbing Up, Dr Michael Devlin, head of advisory services at the Medical Defence Union, explains that GPs are struggling to decide when and if to break patient confidentiality over gun licences.","['Viewpoint', 'Dr Michael Devlin', 'Head Of Advisory Services', 'Medical Defence Union']",None,"Image caption There have been calls for gun control laws to be tightened

As calls are made for tighter gun licence controls in the wake of Derrick Bird's rampage in Cumbria, during which 12 people died, doctors' leaders have been in talks about when to raise concerns over the mental health of patients.

In this week's Scrubbing Up, Dr Michael Devlin says the public may expect a doctor to always speak out but warns there is a risk a patient could feel his confidentiality had been breached and not seek the treatment they need.

It is commonly accepted that it is more difficult to obtain a certificate for a shotgun or firearm in the UK than many other countries.

However, the application process and the monitoring of existing certificate-holders have come under scrutiny in the wake of the Cumbrian tragedy, although there was no indication that Bird was mentally ill.

And there have been calls for gun control laws to be tightened.

Home Secretary Theresa May has said that ""it would be wrong to react before we know the full facts"".

But if, as has been suggested, GPs are given a greater role, it is important that their responsibilities are made clear and that appropriate guidance and advice is available to them.

Problems can arise for the GP if the patient develops a new illness (such as becoming addicted to drugs or alcohol or developing a psychosis) after a certificate has been granted or renewed Dr Michael Devlin Read your comments

Individual police forces have a statutory obligation to deal with applications for firearms or shotgun certificates from individuals living in their area - but they may need the professional opinion of the local GP on the mental state of the applicant, which can create a confidentiality dilemma.

Prospective gun owners are asked to give their written consent to this disclosure and provide details of their GP when completing the application form.

But problems can arise for the GP if the patient develops a new illness (such as becoming addicted to drugs or alcohol or developing a mental health problem) after a certificate has been granted or renewed.

This can create an ethical dilemma and more information or guidance is needed to help the GP come to the right decision.

Doctor-patient relationship

The Medical Defence Union receives on average at least one call a month from doctors seeking advice about the confidentiality of patients who wish to own a gun, hold a shotgun or firearms certificate or who may have access to them.

The most common queries relate to what patient information they can disclose to the police and whether the confidentiality of patients can be breached if a patient with access to a gun gives cause for concern.

In going to the police, the GP could arguably have destroyed the patient's faith in him and may have deterred the man from getting treatment for his condition Dr Michael Devlin

Most people will expect GPs to raise concerns about a patient with access to guns or co-operate with the police if they ask for medical information about a gun owner but it is not always straightforward.

The difficulty is that they have a duty of patient confidentiality which is central to the success of the doctor-patient relationship and means that patients feel able to confide honestly with their GP.

For example, one might see a patient being treated for depression expressing angry resentment towards his ex-wife following an acrimonious divorce and threatening to ""wipe the smile from her face"". At the end of a consultation he may say he is going pheasant shooting that weekend and had owned a shotgun for several years.

Would the GP be justified in breaching patient confidentiality and reporting his threats to the police in these circumstances?

It may be that in doing so the GP could prevent a crime but equally the patient may have felt that the GP's surgery was a safe place in which he could express his frustrations and would never have acted upon his threats.

In going to the police, the GP could arguably have destroyed the patient's faith in him and may have deterred the man from getting treatment for his condition.

The General Medical Council says doctors can disclose patient information without their permission where necessary ""to protect individuals or society from risk of serious harm such as... serious crime"".

The GMC's guidance continues to explain that doctors should usually seek the patient's consent or tell the patient they are going to disclose information without their consent, unless to do so would put others at risk or would undermine the prevention or detection of a serious crime.

Any new government guidance for GPs could further assist doctors in making such difficult decisions.","['concerns', 'gp', 'patients', 'shotgun', 'gps', 'guidance', 'doctors', 'confidentiality', 'information', 'gun', 'speak', 'patient']","Prospective gun owners are asked to give their written consent to this disclosure and provide details of their GP when completing the application form.

Mississippi Burning case: KKK killer Edgar Ray Killen dies,"Edgar Ray Killen, 92, was only jailed in 2005, 41 years after he helped organise a triple murder.",[],None,"Image copyright Marianne Todd Image caption Killen was sent to prison in 2005 for his role in the triple murder

Edgar Ray Killen, the 1960s Ku Klux Klan leader who was convicted over the infamous deaths of three civil rights workers in Mississippi, has died.

The 92-year-old was serving a 60-year sentence, after being jailed in 2005, four decades after the 1964 murders.

The men's disappearance and deaths shocked the country and helped catalyse the passage of the Civil Rights Act.

The triple killing was also the basis for the 1988 Oscar-winning film Mississippi Burning.

The movie is a fictionalised take on the events named after the FBI investigation into the case.

James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, all in their 20s, were members of the Congress of Racial Equality (Core) and had been working on the 1964 Freedom Summer campaign to register black voters in the southern state.

The men were detained by police before being ambushed and shot by Klansmen who were tipped off about their release.

The trio went missing after being arrested by local police on a traffic charge while in Neshoba County, Mississippi. They had been visiting the scene of a fire-bombing and beating at a local church that was going to be used as a Freedom School to educate and help register local African-Americans.

After being released from prison in the night, the men were again stopped and then ambushed by KKK members.

After the case garnered national attention, the FBI was dispatched to the state to investigate by then Attorney General Robert Kennedy.

The three men's bodies were eventually uncovered six weeks after their disappearance, after an informant tipped off the FBI that they had been buried on local farmland.

The FBI arrested more than a dozen suspects, including the county's Deputy Sheriff, because of their alleged involvement in the killings.

A Mississippi judge attempted to dismiss the charges against most of the defendants, but the Supreme Court later reversed the decision.

After federal intervention, 18 men went on trial in 1967 on civil rights violation charges. Only seven were convicted by an all-white jury, and none served more than seven years in prison.

Killen, a former Baptist preacher, was accused of orchestrating the killings, but his trial ended in a hung jury after a juror said she could not convict a preacher.

The state did not pursue the case for four decades, but eventually Killen was brought to face a new trial in 2005.

Prosecutors said as a ""kleagle"" or KKK organiser, he had assembled the murderous mob and instructed them how to dispose of the bodies, but was not at the murder scene itself.

He was convicted of three charges of manslaughter for recruitment and orchestration.

Even after his imprisonment, Killen was said to maintain segregationist views about racial inequality.

The Mississippi Department of Corrections said he had known health conditions, and no foul play was suspected in the 92-year-old's death.","['kkk', 'dies', 'copyright', 'men', 'attorney', 'ray', 'caption', 'killer', 'image', 'trial', 'edgar', 'local', 'fbi', 'killen', 'burning', 'mississippi', 'case']","Image copyright Marianne Todd Image caption Killen was sent to prison in 2005 for his role in the triple murderEdgar Ray Killen, the 1960s Ku Klux Klan leader who was convicted over the infamous deaths of three civil rights workers in Mississippi, has died.

Rembrandt Laughing at risk of leaving the UK,A painting by Dutch master Rembrandt is placed under an export ban as attempts are made to find £16.5m to keep it from leaving the UK.,[],None,"Image caption The painting on copper of a laughing young man is only 24cm by 17cm

A painting by Dutch master Rembrandt has been placed under an export ban as attempts are made to find £16.5m to keep it from leaving the UK.

Rembrandt Laughing, painted in around 1628, was bought at auction by the Getty Museum in Los Angeles this May.

Culture Minister Ed Vaizey said he deferred granting an export licence due to the ""outstanding significance"" of this example of Rembrandt's early work.

The application licence has been deferred until 15 October 2013.

""I hope that my deferral of the export licence will allow time for a buyer to come forward and secure this exquisite painting for the nation,"" Vaizey added.

Getty Museum director Timothy Potts told the LA Times that the museum hoped to add ""lustre"" to their collection with Rembrandt's ""most sustained and remarkable achievement"".

The artwork, one of only a handful of paintings made on copper, is thought to be a self-portrait of the 17th Century Dutch master.

But the picture, known as a ""Tronie"", is thought to have been painted to depict an emotion rather than the likeness of a particular person.

The small image was valued at £1500 pounds in 2007 by a small auction house in Cirencester as it was not believed to be a Rembrandt original.

It was later sold at auction for more than £2.2m to an anonymous buyer after a frantic bidding war.

Ernst van de Wetering, head of the Rembrandt Research Project, confirmed the painting as a genuine painting in a 23-page analysis nine months later.

""Brush stroke, contour, materials and the monogram all point to the master's hand,"" he said at the time.

The highest price paid for a Rembrandt at auction was £20.2m for his Portrait of a Man, Half-Length, With His Arms Akimbo in 2009.","['export', 'painting', 'leaving', 'vaizey', 'rembrandt', 'risk', 'museum', 'thought', 'rembrandts', 'auction', 'small', 'licence', 'uk', 'laughing']","Image caption The painting on copper of a laughing young man is only 24cm by 17cmA painting by Dutch master Rembrandt has been placed under an export ban as attempts are made to find £16.5m to keep it from leaving the UK.

Carl Sargeant: Inquest witness 'may have lied' to coroner,Former communities minister Carl Sargeant was found dead just four days after being sacked.,[],None,"Image caption Carl Sargeant was found dead after an investigation was launched into his conduct

A witness in the Carl Sargeant inquest may have lied to the coroner, the hearing has been told.

Mr Sargeant, 49, was found hanged by his wife Bernadette on 7 November at his home in Connah's Quay, Flintshire.

A statement from Flintshire council's deputy leader, Bernie Attridge, said he thought ""the sacking killed my friend"".

But Cathy McGahey, counsel for Carwyn Jones, said it appeared Mr Attridge had some ""knowledge of behaviour that would have made Mr Sargeant anxious"".

Mr Sargeant was found dead four days after he was sacked as communities minister by the first minister.

The Labour AM had been accused of behaving inappropriately towards women, which he denied, and the inquest was told ""tangible"" complaints were made weeks before he died.

He left a letter apologising to his family and telling them: ""I have failed you.""

Coroner John Gittins agreed to hear applications on the potential submission of new evidence which has come to light from witnesses including Flintshire council leader Aaron Shotton.

Ms McGahey said: ""Mr Shotton has come forward with a witness statement that contradicts some of Mr Attridge's evidence.

""There is what appears to be a text message from Mr Attridge to Mr Shotton on November 1 2017... and it appears to refer to Mr Sargeant.

""Mr Attridge bets he is shitting bricks... He refers to MPs in Westminster being exposed and it won't be long before AMs are... on the hit list.""

Image copyright Helen Tipper Image caption First Minister Carwyn Jones gave evidence to the inquest on Wednesday

Ms McGahey said Mr Attridge went on to say, on 5 November, that rumours about Mr Sargeant were circulating in the Labour Club and he wanted to discourage people in the Labour group from saying anything in support of him.

He then implied, she said, Mr Sargeant had done something ""that could lead to imprisonment"".

""Mr Attridge and Mr Attridge alone will know exactly what he meant by those,"" she told the coroner, before adding: ""It does appear on the face of it that Mr Attridge has not told you the truth.

""Signing the statement of truth when you know something you are saying is not true, is a contempt of court.""

Mr Gittins heard applications from counsel relating to the submission of this new evidence, but he declined, saying he already had enough to do his job.

Earlier, the inquest heard the first minister warned Mr Sargeant to ""be careful"" over conduct and drinking after an anonymous letter said he was ""not fit to be around women"".

Image copyright Helen Tipper Image caption Leslie Thomas QC questioned Carwyn Jones on how Carl Sargeant's sacking was handled

Speaking at the inquest in Ruthin, Denbighshire, on Wednesday, Mr Jones said he had received an anonymous letter in 2014 from someone in Mr Sargeant's Alyn and Deeside constituency.

""I remember the words 'he's not fit to be around women', but the letter was anonymous. I showed it to Carl,"" he told the hearing.

Mr Jones said he told Mr Sargeant in 2014: ""You need to know... be careful, there's obviously someone who's watching you.

""Be careful how you conduct yourself and how much you drink.""

He said Mr Sargeant ""wasn't an alcoholic"", but the company he kept was ""quite a hard-drinking bunch"".

He told Mr Gittins the pair had known each other since 2001 and had ""never had a cross word"".

Mr Jones did not know Mr Sargeant suffered from depression or had taken anti-depressants, the inquest heard.

Tweet after dismissal

Image copyright Twitter/ @carlsargeant1 Image caption Carl Sargeant tweeted a statement after being sacked by the Welsh Government four days before he died.

Asked when he first became aware of rumours about Mr Sargeant's conduct, he said: ""Rumours are plentiful in politics. Evidence is rare.""

He did not know what the rumours were, but became aware of them on 18 October 2017, the day he held a meeting with senior advisors to discuss the cabinet reshuffle.

One of two complainants who had made allegations about Mr Sargeant put it in writing to the Labour party in October, dating from an event in summer 2017.

Pushed by the coroner why he had not spoken to Mr Sargeant, he said: ""Had I given him more details in terms of the allegations... he'd have known straight away, I suspect, who those people were and that was a risk I couldn't take.""

He said ""the fact we had names"" meant there was ""an obligation to look further"".

Mr Sargeant tweeted a statement on the afternoon he was sacked - highlighting that it related to personal conduct - and Mr Jones said there was ""no need to volunteer the information"".

Mr Gittins responded: ""So that's what happens in politics? We keep secrets because it suits everybody to do so?""

""It's not secrets. It's a gentler way of doing it,"" said Mr Jones.

Image caption Carwyn Jones is stepping down as first minister in December

Ahead of the meeting between the pair, Mr Jones said he had ""a feeling of dread going in that morning... I had lost sleep over it,"" but said it ""had to be done"".

Mr Sargeant's response was ""curious"", and he said he ""did not recognise"" the allegations.

""In politics, that's not a denial,"" Mr Jones said.

He was ""a little panicked but not distraught,"" but Mr Jones said there was ""no reason to doubt that he understood the implications"".

He advised him to speak to his trade union for advice and ""keep your head down"".

But following Mr Sargeant's tweet, he said the Welsh Government had to ""firefight"".

""The press would speculate. Twitter is corrosive,"" he added.

""Because of that tweet there was a media frenzy that made all manner of allegations about Carl that weren't true.""

The inquest heard audio of Mr Jones speaking on a BBC Wales news broadcast on 6 November, the day before Mr Sargeant died.

In it, Mr Jones used the words ""incidents"". The coroner asked him if he saw the difference between that and the word ""allegations"".

""It's quite clear from that news report that the news report is about allegations,"" he replied.

Image caption Leslie Thomas QC is representing the Sargeant family

Mr Jones had said the reshuffle happened on a Friday as Mr Sargeant had been away and if it was held mid-week he would not have had the support of his family on hand.

Leslie Thomas QC, representing the Sargeant family, asked why it was necessary to draw Mr Sargeant's attention to the anonymous letter sent in 2014.

Mr Jones felt it was right to let him know, as the letter had also been sent to Mrs Sargeant.

He had not spoken to Mr Sargeant about a complaint from 2016 because ""the complainant didn't want me to"".

The inquest heard Ann Jones AM acted in a liaison role between the Labour group and Mr Sargeant, and secondly in a pastoral role.

Mr Jones said this happened on the afternoon following Mr Sargeant's dismissal and Ms Jones ""wanted to make sure that Carl was okay from a personal level as well"".

Mr Jones planned to hold a reshuffle in November 2017 because he was in talks with an AM who had left his party, as well as wanting to offer new opportunities to others.

'Complete discretion'

During the course of the discussions, he received the written complaints about Mr Sargeant.

Prior to that, Mr Jones characterised rumours about Mr Sargeant as ""tittle-tattle"", according to evidence from one of his special advisors.

Mr Jones said the written allegations, which came just days before the reshuffle on 3 November, ""could not be ignored as part of the reshuffle process"".

Mr Sargeant, who was being considered for the role of leader of the house, was sacked that day.

Mr Jones confirmed it was ""wholly"" his responsibility who was appointed or moved and he had ""complete discretion"" over the cabinet.

Earlier, Mr Jones' senior special advisor Matthew Greenough was recalled to the inquest to clarify some of the evidence he gave on Tuesday, around the timings of allegations made against Mr Sargeant.

The ""tangible"" complaints referred to alleged incidents in summer 2017, made by women known in court as Miss A and Miss B.

These were reported via the Labour Party to Mr Jones in October 2017. One of two women involved later made a written statement.

'Rumours' about Mr Sargeant

There had previously been two separate allegations in 2016, although one was in the form of an anonymous letter.

Mr Greenough agreed one allegation by a woman known as Miss C could have been made in 2015, but he did not know about it until 2016.

He told the court he was present in the room when the reshuffle where Mr Sargeant lost his job took place and no information regarding any of the women was discussed in his presence.

He told Mr Thomas he did not believe Mr Jones could have had a conversation with anyone without him knowing.

Special advisor Jane Runeckles confirmed there were ""rumours"" about Mr Sargeant, but he was still in consideration for leader of the house at a meeting on 18 October 2017.

Image caption Mr Sargeant's body was found in the utility room of his house in Connah's Quay

The coroner said he struggled to understand how that might still be the case.

""The first minister was absolutely clear at that point that it was tittle-tattle. He had nothing to suggest otherwise,"" she replied.

Mr Sargeant's sacking was precipitated by Mr Greenough receiving the written statement from one complainant on 1 November.

Mr Gittins asked if that was ""the deciding factor in terms of his removal from office"", to which Ms Runeckles replied ""yes"", adding it would have been difficult to postpone a reshuffle.

Mr Sargeant's brother Andy asked whether Ms Runeckles did anything to support him, and she said ""no"", explaining: ""The whim of the electorate is something [politicians] subject themselves to... you go into it knowing that this kind of thing can happen to you.""

'Setting the scene'

Mr Thomas repeatedly questioned Ms Runeckles over the 18 October meeting and any discussion of the rumours around Mr Sargeant, particularly in light of the #MeToo movement and ""political fallout"" in Westminster.

She told the court she did not enquire where the rumours had come from and said they were ""not relevant"", which Mr Thomas challenged. She agreed she could have spoken to Mr Sargeant about the matter, but did not.

Mr Thomas asked if the reshuffle was ""just a convenient way of trying to mask"" the situation surrounding Mr Sargeant. ""Absolutely not,"" she replied.

The first minister was asked why, after allegations from Miss A and Miss B in 2017, Miss C - who made her original allegation in 2016 - was contacted to see if she wished to complain.

He accused Mr Jones of ""setting the scene"" to ""get rid"" of Mr Sargeant.

""I could've removed Carl from the cabinet for no reason at all,"" Mr Jones responded.

He said he felt it was right someone who had come forward in 2016 should now be asked if they wanted to make a complaint.","['sargeants', 'attridge', 'coroner', 'inquest', 'allegations', 'sargeant', 'told', 'carl', 'jones', 'lied', 'rumours', 'witness', 'mr']","Image caption Carl Sargeant was found dead after an investigation was launched into his conductA witness in the Carl Sargeant inquest may have lied to the coroner, the hearing has been told.

A cyber attack on the French television network TV5 Monde may have been carried out by Russian-based hackers, police believe.

Jihadist propaganda was posted on the station's website in April by individuals claiming to represent Islamic State.

A police investigation is now focussing on a group of Russian hackers called APT28, according to French media.

The group has tried to hack the White House in the past, L'Express reports.

It has also targeted the computer systems of Nato members, Russian dissidents and Ukrainian activists, according to the newspaper.

A judicial source told AFP that investigators were narrowing the search by probing the IP addresses of computers used in the attack.

TV5 Monde was forced to broadcast pre-recorded programmes after the hack, which it described as ""unprecedented in the history of television"".

MI5 feared Siemens staff had Nazi spy links during WWII,"Employees of the German company Siemens were investigated for espionage by MI5, newly released files show.","['Kayte Rath', 'Bbc News']",None,"Image caption The file contained a diagram published in US magazine PM suggesting how companies could be linked to the Third Reich

Employees of the German company Siemens were investigated for espionage by MI5, it has been revealed.

Newly released files show a number of employees were investigated for intelligence activities while working for the company in the 1930s and 1940s.

MI5 feared the company, which had branches all over the world, was assisting the Nazi regime in its foreign policy and war objectives.

The files, released by MI5, can be seen at the National Archives in Kew.

British intelligence feared German companies operating in the UK or abroad, particularly in the British Empire, could be used by the German government as part of its broader foreign policy and war effort.

By 1936 the Nazi regime had made it clear ""every German man and woman must render service to the Fatherland in time of war and that Germans who live abroad, including those of dual nationality, are bound to serve when called up"".

The files show a number of investigations were ordered into individual employees of Siemens, a German industrial conglomerate.

Some of these were requested by Lord Rothschild, who was head of the counter-sabotage unit at MI5 at the time.

'Rabid Nazi cell'

In the run up to World War II, MI5 was concerned about Siemens' operations in the UK.

One branch of the company, Siemens Schukert, which had factories in Ealing and Acton in west London, was described in the files as ""a rabid Nazi cell"".

There were suspicions that German employees of the firm were involved in intelligence work.

Engineers were said to continually travel around the UK but ""no-one knew where they went"".

The British branch of the firm was closed down following the start of the war under the 1939 Trading with the Enemy Act.

'Clandestine'

Siemens first came to the attention of MI5 during World War I following an anonymous letter from Chile.

It described how Britons living in Antofagasta in Chile believed the company had a ""clandestine wireless installation"".

Suspicious activity was also reported in Siemens branches in Georgia, Spain, Switzerland, Egypt, Panama and Argentina during World War I.","['company', 'mi5', 'feared', 'files', 'german', 'staff', 'war', 'employees', 'nazi', 'intelligence', 'siemens', 'wwii', 'links', 'world', 'spy']","MI5 feared the company, which had branches all over the world, was assisting the Nazi regime in its foreign policy and war objectives.

Four centuries after gin was introduced to Britain, a new generation of boutique distilleries - some in residential homes - is driving a British gin revival.

Behind an anonymous door in an office block in north London, serious-looking women wearing white lab coats are pouring and measuring liquids.

A machine spins away on a counter, and off to the side something white and viscous is bubbling away in a flask.

The din of machinery and hushed whispers in technical language bring to mind medical research or nuclear science.

But all of this activity is dedicated to the art of the cocktail - and much of it is devoted to finding the perfect companion to the queen of spirits, gin.

Remixing a classic

Tony Conigliaro is the chief bartender - he eschews the term ""mixologist"" - and his lab is constantly making new raw materials for his two cocktail bars, as well as undertaking research for outside clients.

People are drinking less, but they are drinking better Sam Galsworthy, Sipsmith microdistillery

""With the influence of chefs around the world, we wanted to match that with a level of accuracy and new innovative ideas, flavours and flavour combinations,"" he says.

The lab's shelves are lined with herbs, spices and plants such as dandelion leaf, Szechuan pepper, angelica root, hibiscus, lemon verbena, white chocolate and nettle - all building blocks for new drinks.

Of course, cocktails have long been on the menu in British bars and pubs.

But instead of sweet fizzy drinks and easily chugged shots, these are concoctions for a more sophisticated drinker.

And the real key to Conigliaro's recipes lies in the alcoholic kick provided by a new breed of distillers.

""There's some really interesting gins coming out,"" he says.

Image caption The Drunkard's Children by George Cruikshank depicts the seedier side of London's infamous gin palaces of the mid-19th Century

""Their structure is interesting and they're using new botanicals. What's being produced is phenomenal.

""We're selling more gin martinis than ever before,"" he says. ""Considering it's 80% gin, that means that people are liking gin.""

Domestic distilleries

London is in the midst of a craft distilling revival.

Image caption Sam Galsworthy and Fairfax Hall, founders of the microdistillery Sipsmith and their distiller, Prudence

New microdistilleries can be found in residential houses - such as Sacred Spirits, based in London's sedate Highgate. And they're tucked away in terraces - such as gin and vodka makers Sipsmith in Hammersmith.

These new distillers are a far cry from the back-street operators who turned out rough booze in the 19th Century.

The gory excess of London's spirit craze at that time was gruesomely portrayed in the artwork of George Cruikshank and William Hogarth - whose print Gin Lane depicts dead babies, binge-drinking children and starving alcoholics.

It is not exactly a refined image of alcohol - but despite this, some of today's gin makers still take a measure of inspiration from the past.

""We try to reflect the old school way of distilling, which is known as one-shot,"" says Sipsmith co-founder Sam Galsworthy.

He proudly shows off Prudence - distillers traditionally give their stills female names.

She is an impressively gleaming room-sized copper machine, but she could easily fit several times over in just one of the stills used by bigger spirits brands.

""We do not blend, we do not make a concentrate,"" Galsworthy says.

""People are drinking less, but they are drinking better. If they're going to have a gin and tonic, they're going to have a better gin and tonic, they're just going to have it less frequently.

""That is one of the indicators that will happen in a recession.""

Next big gin

And since gin is often mentioned in the same breath as tonic, perhaps it is no surprise that other businesspeople have opted to remix the mixer.

Co-founder Charles Rolls used to work for Plymouth Gin, but he grew to hate the metallic flavour and bitter aftertaste of saccharin - the dominant sweetener in most tonic waters today.

""I was always frustrated by the fact that when we could show the differences between these great gins - the way they smell with the different botanicals - when you went to mix them, they always just smelt of the tonic.""

Fever Tree, established in 2005, now produces a range of soft drinks, and Rolls says the company shipped 30 million bottles in 2011.

These new companies are operating in a tough economic climate, but even more surprising is that some are thriving in a stable-to-declining market for gin, one that is dominated by big brands with marketing clout.

Spiros Malandrakis, drinks analyst at marketing research firm Euromonitor, thinks craft gin could be the next big spirit, even though he notes the overall global gin market posted a 1% decline in total volume sold in 2010.

""While the top-line figures might look sobering at first, if we dig a bit deeper we know that there are segments where we can see optimism and buoyancy,"" he says.

""People are really sick of mainstream mass-produced brands. They want something different, they want something with character.

""They want something to reflect where they're coming from and what their values are,"" he says.

Since Sipsmith opened up the first new copper-pot distillery in London for nearly two centuries - requiring the issuing of a special licence - at least half a dozen more distillers have opened up elsewhere in the capital, some in the most unlikely places.

""I just found out recently that a small distillery will be opening up in my building in Hackney Wick,"" Malandrakis says.

""It's weird... and wonderful.""

Drink-drive detections down on previous Christmas period,PSNI say 322 drink drivers were arrested - 38 fewer than in the same period for 2017/18.,[],None,"Image copyright PA Image caption More than 11,000 people were tested during this year's operation

More than 300 drink-drivers were detected by the PSNI in the run-up to and over Christmas.

The figure was down by more than 10% on the previous year.

The youngest person detected was 14 years old, while the oldest was 83 years old.

According to preliminary figures released on Monday by police, 322 drink drivers were arrested - 38 fewer than in the same period for 2017/18.

The 2018/19 winter anti-drink drive operation ran from 30 November until 1 January.

More than 11,000 people were tested during the operation.

Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said one of those drivers was detected at more than four times the drink drive limit, with a reading of 153 mcg of alcohol in 100 ml of breath.

The legal limit is 35 mcg of alcohol in 100 ml of breath.

Image caption ACC Alan Todd said detections were made at all times of the day

Seventy two of the 322 people arrested were women, as compared to 49 out of a total of 360 during the previous campaign.

ACC Todd said detections were made at all times of the day on roads across Northern Ireland and that drivers were also arrested for being under the influence of drugs.

""In one incident, after being involved in a collision, a driver was arrested for driving under the influence of drugs. Approximately £3,000 worth of suspected drugs were recovered from the vehicle, leading to the driver being further arrested on suspicion of a number of drug offences.

'Shameful'

""In another incident, police detected and arrested a HGV driver returning to their place of work, having carried out their morning deliveries.

""It's disappointing that despite our repeated and well publicised warnings, a minority of people completely disregarded the safety of themselves and others by taking the shameful and incredibly dangerous risk of driving after drinking.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption In December, NI Crimestoppers saw a 65% increase in calls with information about drink driving

This year's operation was also supported by the independent charity Crimestoppers, which gave the public the opportunity to provide information about drink drivers anonymously.

Sue Brew, regional manager for Northern Ireland Crimestoppers, said that during December, the organisation saw a 65% increase in calls with information about drink driving, compared to the average over the previous seven months.

""As we said at the outset of this campaign, by trusting us with your information, you'll remain 100% anonymous. Always. We never take personal details and calls cannot be traced. Together we can help protect those you care about.""

Checkpoints

ACC Todd added that in the months ahead, police ""will continue to use all the powers and legislation at our disposal, including the authorised checkpoints, to detect people who insist on driving after having taken drugs or alcohol"".

In December, BBC News NI reported that the PSNI cannot fully enforce tougher drink-driving laws introduced almost three years ago as they do not yet have access to breathalysers capable of testing lower blood alcohol levels introduced by the assembly in April 2016.

"'It was either die, or get help'","""Sandra"" tells the BBC her life has turned around since attending a project in Glasgow which is an alternative to prison.",[],None,"Image caption ""Sandra"" told Baroness Kennedy she started going to Tomorrow's Women's two years ago and said her life has turned around

Sandra has been an alcoholic for 26 years. She's now in her 40s and had been offending for about 20 years. She got a Community Payback Order as an alternative to prison two years ago, and started going to Tomorrow's Women, a community justice project which deals with the most hard-to-reach women in Glasgow. She hasn't had a drink or committed a crime in well over a year.

Sandra (not her real name) says: ""When I first started coming to Tomorrow's Women, I wouldn't really engage - I was still drinking and I didn't want to face up to my problems. I was frightened.

""But last January, I decided I'd had enough - suicidal thoughts were coming into my head and I asked to go into rehab. Mentally and physically I was just broken. It was either die or get help.

""The staff from Tomorrow's Women helped me get into rehab, they came up to see me all the time. I started receiving trauma counselling. And it's made a massive, massive difference to my life.

""I was drinking because I didn't feel great about myself, I had no confidence because of a trauma experience and incidents that had happened in my life up until my 20s. I just let myself get used and abused, I suppose, for years. I felt that was all I deserved.

""When I came out of rehab, I started coming back here to Tomorrow's Women. The staff got me a flat, a cracking flat at the other end of the city. I had to change everything about my life - I really started engaging. So that's what helped. But it was very difficult.

""People think projects like this are a soft option, that prison's the hard bit. But I would say dealing with all your problems is harder. I went through every emotion that you could imagine. And at times I wanted to throw in the towel. It was so painful.

""I feel on top of the world now. I've made brilliant friends at Tomorrow's Women. I think the fact that it's all women is important. And the fact that it's a multi-agency service - you're not going from one side of Glasgow to the other. Somebody's helping you with your housing, mental health, all in the one place.

""A few weeks ago, I wasn't well, and the women offered to come up and get my shopping. It's wee things like that. With the lassies and the staff - nothing's fake.

Why is heroin killing so many people?,Heroin deaths in the UK are rocketing - is it time for a radical solution?,[],None,"Warning: Depictions of drug use Lisa used to be married. She had two jobs and was a mum to five kids. She calls it her normal life. Now there’s only one thing on her mind. It’s all Lisa has been thinking about since she woke up. Heroin.

Sitting in a friend’s house, she unwraps the foil carefully. “0.2g in weight, £10 in money,” she says, her eyes fixed on the brown powder. Reaching for a syringe, she wipes away a tear. Staring straight at the heroin, she admits: “I put it before my children.” We have no idea where Lisa got the money for her latest fix, or where she bought it from. We don’t ask. In complete silence she unwraps the foil, reveals the brown powder, and gets the syringe ready. Next the injection - she’s breathing heavily as the heroin courses through her veins.

After a while, her eyes drop. She has a moment in her own world. This is Lisa’s life. It’s the same routine day after day. And in a few hours, she’ll be searching for more. Lisa calls it “rattling” - the feeling she has without heroin. “Legs aching, body sweating, hallucinations, diarrhoea, sick.” And in that moment what does she need more than anything? “Brown powder to put everything right, automatic fix.”

The desperation never ends. Even with her prescription of methadone, which is supposed to be a longer-acting substitute for heroin, to help addicts stabilise, she still craves the real thing. Lisa’s life has been this way for 12 years, on and off. She shakes her head as she describes the panic of waking up every morning addicted to heroin.

It controls everything. Being an addict is a full-time job Lisa

“I think, 'Where am I going to find the money today to score?' Money to get a bag [of heroin] to get myself better.” “It controls everything, it controls every part of your day,” she says. “It is a disease, all of addiction is a disease.

“I said to the woman at the job centre I haven’t got time to get a job - being an addict is a full-time job. It’s ridiculous.” As Lisa talks she looks down, mumbles. Her face is hollow, gaunt - the effects of years of addiction. She describes how she ended up here.

Summit planned to help military personnel,The Labour Party is to host a summit with the main military charities amid growing claims of discrimination against service personnel.,"['Sima Kotecha', 'Bbc Today Programme Reporter']",None,"Image caption One in five military personnel has been refused service in a bar or hotel

The Labour Party is to host a summit with leading military charities on how to deal with discrimination against the armed forces.

A recent poll suggested one in five military personnel had been refused service in a bar or hotel over fears they would cause trouble.

Labour is calling on the government to make it a criminal offence.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said discrimination against its servicemen and women is unacceptable.

This programme has heard from dozens of military personnel who say they have been refused entry into pubs and clubs over the last couple of years.

The owners of a bar in Coventry were recently criticised for turning away two soldiers in uniform who wanted non-alcoholic drinks.

They later apologised.

Yeah, some soldiers are trouble makers I get that - but we're not all the same. That's like saying a group of football players come into a pub and cause trouble so now no more football players can come in again British Army private

But some pub owners say troops often cause trouble which ends in violence and damage to their property.

Labour wants a new bill to outlaw discrimination against service personnel.

Stories of soldiers going to war for their country and then being barred from pubs when they return home have been reported in the newspapers for years.

Sir Simon Wessley, director of Kings College London's centre for military research, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme 2% of people in the UK have openly hostile views to people in the armed forces.

But dozens of soldiers and veterans have contacted the programme in recent weeks, claiming it is getting worse.

They claim some pub landlords refuse to let them in because they are worried they will cause violence.

Refused entry

A 21-year-old private, who does not wish to be named, told me how he and his comrades were refused entry to their local nightclub.

He said: ""We got in a queue, none of us were drunk, I don't drink myself so I definitely wasn't drunk. And when we got to the bouncer at the front of the door, he said, 'Sorry lads, it's not soldier night tonight.' He thought we were going to cause trouble.""

His words resonate with the dozens of military personnel who have contacted us through social media, email, and text messages.

A poll conducted by the Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft in 2012 suggested one in five soldiers had been refused service in bars and hotels and more than one in 20 had experienced violence while in uniform.

The Labour MP for Dunfermline and West Fife, Thomas Docherty, initiated a call for new legislation that would make it illegal to discriminate against military personnel by refusing to serve them in hotels and pubs.

The bill would also mean certain offences committed towards members of the armed forces would be treated as ""aggravated"" which would mean a harsher penalty for the person convicted of the crime.

Rowdy reputation

Mr Docherty said British soldiers did have a reputation for being rowdy and provocative but he insisted they had changed.

He said: ""There is this kind of media perception historically but the Army has taken huge steps in recent years to change its culture and I think society hasn't caught up with the changes the Army has made.""

But research from King's College London suggests there is a strong correlation between psychological trauma incurred in places like Afghanistan and Iraq and aggressive behaviour back home.

A recent study published in the Lancet Medical Journal supported this research. But results of other studies show abusive behaviour is not always linked to returning from deployment - and that the risk of violence may be partly related to a soldier's upbringing or early anti-social behaviour.

A former pub landlady who wants to remain anonymous said most service personnel were troublesome.

In an email she said: ""Surely questions should be asked about why these serving members of the forces feel the need to go out and get blind drunk, fight and then end up crying.""

The government said the military covenant that was enshrined into law in 2011 showed its commitment to the armed forces and if people were keen to support the military they could join the Community Covenant scheme which is about local communities doing more to understand the forces and the problems they face.

The MoD has invested £30m into the project over four years.

The Minister for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans, Mark Francois, added that he had no requests from Army chiefs for a new law.

A Special Economic Area (SEA) has been pencilled in for the former Redcar steelworks site from April next year.

A report by Redcar and Cleveland Council has estimated the zone will see the South Tees Development Corporation (STDC) bring in £340m of rates in the next 25 years.

But Redcar’s Labour MP Anna Turley has warned it must not mean the government “handing over” the cost of regenerating the site to Teesside taxpayers.

She said: “Lord Heseltine was clear when the steelworks closed that the government would foot the clean-up bill, whatever it came to. The government must make good on that promise and not rely on local people or businesses to pay the costs.”

The rates income on the site would be shared equally between the council and the STDC – with 50% of the rates reinvested in the 4,500-acre site.

The report stated Redcar and Cleveland Council would be “circa. £121.930m better off over a 25-year period, if an SEA was in place. Without the SEA in place, it is estimated that only £49.478m would be generated for the council.”

But Ms Turley said the SEA must not be a “smoke and mirrors accounting exercise” which deprived funding for local services and “let the government off the hook”.

A report by Redcar and Cleveland Council has estimated the zone will see the South Tees Development Corporation (STDC) bring in £340m of rates in the next 25 years.

But Redcar’s Labour MP Anna Turley has warned it must not mean the government “handing over” the cost of regenerating the site to Teesside taxpayers.

She said: “Lord Heseltine was clear when the steelworks closed that the government would foot the clean-up bill, whatever it came to. The government must make good on that promise and not rely on local people or businesses to pay the costs.”

The rates income on the site would be shared equally between the council and the STDC – with 50% of the rates reinvested in the 4,500-acre site.

The report stated Redcar and Cleveland Council would be “circa. £121.930m better off over a 25-year period, if an SEA was in place. Without the SEA in place, it is estimated that only £49.478m would be generated for the council.”

But Ms Turley said the SEA must not be a “smoke and mirrors accounting exercise” which deprived funding for local services and “let the government off the hook”.

The MP added: “I will still be demanding the necessary investment from the chancellor in his spending review to clean this site up and get the investment and jobs that we need.”","['council', 'turley', 'zone', 'clarence', 'stdc', 'sea', 'port', 'site', 'mp', 'redcar', 'steelworks', 'rates']","A trading zone forecast to rake in £340m in business rates must not be a “smoke and mirrors” exercise, an MP has warned.

Pelton Fell News,Get the latest news in the Pelton Fell area from BBC News.,[],None,"A violent thug who was detained by mourners after stabbing a father and son at a funeral wake has been jailed.

Daniel Orrick, 26, was sentenced to more than five years behind bars following the attack outside the Coach and Horses Inn in Birtley, Gateshead, in January.

A 42-year-old man and his 16-year-old son were among the mourners gathered at the pub. They went outside after getting into an argument at the bar, Northumbria Police said.

Orrick (pictured) was already standing outside, on Durham Road, and got into an altercation when he was approached by the older man.

The man threw a pint glass at Orrick's head while his teenage son watched on.

Orrick then produced a hunting knife and lunged at the man, only to plunge the blade into the stomach of his teenage son. He then turned his attention back to the father - brawling with him on the ground and stabbing him in the leg.

When he tried to flee, Orrick was tackled by other members of the funeral party.

The 42-year-old’s injuries were not serious, but his son had to undergo emergency surgery.

Orrick, of Hertford, Allerdene, was charged with two counts of wounding with intent to commit grievous bodily harm and one count of possession of an offensive weapon.

He was jailed at Newcastle Crown Court for five years and four months. He was also handed a 10-year restraining order.

The MI5 spy who saved children from a UK bomb attack,"Former MI5 agent ""Tom Marcus"" risked his life for more than eight years, secretly tracking Islamic extremists and IRA groups.","['Monica Soriano', 'Victoria Derbyshire Programme']",None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Former MI5 officer ""Tom Marcus"" tells Victoria Derbyshire how he disguised himself as a homeless person to foil an imminent terror plot

As an MI5 agent ""Tom Marcus"" risked his life for more than eight years, secretly tracking Islamic extremists and IRA dissidents on the streets of Britain. But when he left MI5 - with a CV full of inexplicable holes - he found himself taking jobs in a call centre and burger bar.

Tom Marcus is still jittery three years after retiring as a spy, he tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Walking down the street, he sometimes sees suspicious behaviour where there is none - shady people lurking in doorways; unusual bulges in coats; nervous, furtive glances.

Tom - not his real name, it can't be used for security reasons - saw plenty during his eight years as an MI5 surveillance officer to make him suspicious.

On one occasion he helped thwart a plan to blow up two coaches full of schoolchildren returning from a trip to France.

Undercover as a homeless man, and positioned near a mosque, he had noticed that a young Muslim man he had been tracking - who had fought with militant Islamist group Boko Haram in Africa before returning to the UK - had entered the place of worship but not left it. He had also counted more women leaving the building than going in.

He decided that one of the ""women"" leaving must have been the male extremist disguised in a burka. He informed his superiors, and the man - found to have six home-made bombs in his car - was arrested. The bombs were all set to go off at the same time via a mobile phone found on the suspect, meaning Tom almost certainly saved lives that day.

The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.

Watch the full interview with Tom here.

The biggest operation in which Tom was involved stopped a planned bombing of a shopping centre in Manchester over an Easter weekend, potentially saving hundreds of lives. This was one part of a highly co-ordinated attack on people in the UK and US, directed from Pakistan, which also aimed to explode car bombs at the site of the Twin Towers on the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Tom himself became a target for an attempted beheading when extremists developed a plan to kidnap MI5 operatives in the UK. The extremists had assigned people to watch the spies while they were following a suspect, and had covered the floor of a house in Kentish Town, north London, with plastic sheeting in anticipation of taking one captive. A black flag, three butchers' knives and a video camera, suggesting it would be filmed, were also found at the house.

Tom - who has written his memoirs, Soldier Spy - says that were it not for the extremists' ""targets team"" backing out at the last moment, he would not be here to tell the tale.

CV gap

In the end, the job caught up with Tom. He suffered nightmares about being attacked and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), returning to civilian life in 2013. He feels he's recovered now.

He also struggled to find another job. Because of the anonymity required by MI5, Tom, who joined the Army at the age of 16 before moving on to the security services, has a large gap in his CV.

""It's been hugely difficult to get a job,"" he says. ""Working as an MI5 surveillance officer is seen as a job for life - so when you have to come out it's very difficult to figure out what job you can do.

""You can't answer the question about what you've been doing for the last 10 to 15 years in a job interview properly because you'd be breaking the Official Secrets Act.""

Image caption MI5 headquarters in London

""Some people come up with a Ministry of Defence cover story,"" he says, ""but trying to explain the skills you say you have for a made-up story just unravels - and I wouldn't feel comfortable doing that.

""So, work-wise, I just started at the bottom of the pile again. I got an MI5 pension but I had to make money by working in call centres and flipping burgers to build up work experience.""

He is now a full-time writer.

""The only really well-paid options for someone like me were in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, but I just couldn't risk my life doing that.

""It was never an option. I didn't want my PTSD to come back. And no amount of money is worth risking being caught and beheaded.""

'Mr and Mrs Smith'

Part of the reason for Tom's concern is that, while working as a spy, he married a fellow special operations agent and they had a son together.

""People used to joke about it, calling us Mr and Mrs Smith,"" he says, referring to the married spies in a film of the same name, starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. But, unlike the Hollywood actors, Tom's marriage has endured.

Tom, who grew up in poverty in northern England - his father an alcoholic ex-soldier who killed himself - takes extra care to make sure his son is safe at all times. He had the boy's clothes tagged so that he could be traced via GPS if he was captured on the way to or from his nursery. His sleeping bag at home is tagged for the same reason.

But, despite these precautions, Tom thinks the UK, which has not seen a multiple-fatality terrorist attack since the London bombings of 7 July 2005, is ""the safest place in the world"".

It is, he says, served by the ""best group of intelligence agencies in the world"" in MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. But they face growing and varied challenges.

Image copyright Gareth Cattermole Image caption 52 people lost their lives in the 7 July London bombings

""The tactics change completely,"" says Tom - who monitored suspected spies from Russia and China, and spied on the Continuity IRA, during his career.

""When you are watching an IRA terrorist you have to be careful about having no kit that could identify them. They're very good at counter-surveillance so could spot an MI5 officer unless they were very careful.

""Islamic extremists are normally quite settled in their local communities - and so the MI5 officers need to be very aware and sensitive about how they move in and out of these local areas so as not to draw attention to themselves.

""The Russians are so aware and in tune to surveillance operations from other secret services. If they suspect they're being watched they just won't do anything to do with their intelligence activities. You have have to watch Russian spies from a distance and never have the same people watching them.

""There is no one target who's easier or more difficult to watch - it's just different depending on who you are watching.""

Of course, Tom says, it only takes one successful terrorist to create havoc on a grand scale.

""But if you do get frightened watching the news,"" he adds, ""just be confident that everything is being done to keep you safe.""

Tom Marcus's account of events has been vetted and cleared for publication by MI5 as part of his memoirs. Names and some specific details in the book have been changed in order to protect colleagues and ensure current and future investigations are not jeopardised.

Welsh Lib Dems challenged over William Powell warning,The Welsh Conservatives say they want more details from the Lib Dems about the action taken by the party after a complaint of inappropriate behaviour was made against one of its AMs.,[],None,"Image caption William Powell has issued an unreserved apology

The Welsh Conservatives say they want more details from the Lib Dems about the action taken by the party after a complaint of inappropriate behaviour was made against one of its AMs.

Mid and West Wales AM William Powell made an unreserved apology to a female activist after an incident in 2011.

The Lib Dems said Mr Powell was given a formal written warning last year.

But the Conservatives want clarification about whether it has satisfied the person who came forward.

It has emerged Mr Powell had been given a formal written warning by his party.

A Welsh Conservative spokesman said: ""We want clarification about what a written warning means in practice and whether it has satisfied the person who came forward with the allegation.""

A statement from the Liberal Democrats on Saturday said Mr Powell was told that any future misdemeanour could result in more serious sanctions being imposed.

The Conservatives said they would like to know what those sanctions could be.

The woman who complained, now 21, alleged that in 2011 Mr Powell gave her and two other women the strong alcoholic drink absinthe, touched her leg and put his hands round their waists.

The Lib Dems confirmed the warning.

The incident involving Mr Powell, his party's agriculture spokesman, was reported in the Daily Mail.

In a statement on Saturday, the Welsh Lib Dems said they had received an anonymous complaint in May last year about Mr Powell's behaviour in an incident in June 2011.

The complainant had spoken to the chair of her local party, the statement said.

Written warning

She said she did not want to pursue a formal grievance procedure and wished to remain anonymous, but wanted the party to be aware of the issue.

The Welsh Lib Dems said the complaint was treated seriously, a report was compiled and passed to their chief whip in Cardiff Bay, Aled Roberts.

Mr Powell was interviewed by Mr Roberts and given a formal written warning that such behaviour would not be tolerated.

He was told any future misdemeanour could result in ""more serious sanctions being imposed"".

The party says that no further complaint has been received since.

Mr Powell said in a statement: ""I am aware of an anonymous complaint having been made.

""The complaint was put to me by the chief whip and I cooperated fully with him in this matter.

""I apologised to the chief whip and offered an unreserved apology, through him, to anyone else for any hurt or offence caused and I would certainly wish to do so again, in writing or in person.""","['william', 'welsh', 'warning', 'lib', 'statement', 'written', 'party', 'powell', 'dems', 'challenged', 'complaint', 'mr']","The Lib Dems said Mr Powell was given a formal written warning last year.

Three perspectives on tackling reoffending on Teesside,"A victim of crime, a former criminal and a judge offer their thoughts on how to stop criminals reoffending.",[],None,"The government is expected later this year to unveil measures to tackle the problem of record criminal reoffending rates.

Recent government figures say Durham and Tees Valley has the joint highest rate of reoffending in the country, along with Merseyside.

Thirty per cent of offenders in the area commit further crimes within 12 months.

The Ministry of Justice is currently holding a consultation into effective ""punishment and reform"", looking at how to stop offenders repeatedly cycling through the criminal justice system.

On Teesside three people, with three different experiences of crime, have their own ideas.

The victim

Image caption Rape victims are granted perpetual anonymity under law

Jo, from Darlington, was raped in 2004. Six years later she met her attacker.

""It was absolutely fantastic. I wanted to get my feelings across to him.""

She believes restorative justice - allowing offenders to come face to face with victims - can help cut reoffending.

""I'd been told that he'd been doing victim empathy work in prison.

""But nobody could tell him exactly what he'd done to me and my family apart from me,"" she said.

""He hadn't considered the wider family. He hadn't considered what he'd done to my mum, my dad and my husband, no-one had spoken to him about that.

""He did apologise and it was sincere - he was crying when he said it - and I have been told since that he's making fantastic progress now.""

The former re-offender

Jodie Hind, from Stockton, has spent most of his adult life in prison.

""I think it happened early, somewhere in childhood, something wasn't quite right.

""I never felt I belonged anywhere. I had a father who was alcoholic,"" he said.

His use of legal terms and criminal slang betray his past - he talks about ""twocing"" and ""taking without consent"" - what people outside the justice system would call stealing cars.

Image caption Jodie Hind says he has spent 70 per cent of his adult life in prison

He progressed through theft and drug dealing to burglary, once addiction had ""set in"".

""I just could not put the drugs down,"" he said.

""I was beat into submission, I'd had enough. I'd simply had enough.

""There was nowhere else I could go. I was either going to die or spend the rest of my life in prison.""

His father stopped drinking and set him a ""good example"" which Jodie felt he had to follow although ""the damage had set in"".

""What I had to do was stop blaming everything in and about me, family, whatever had happened.

""Putting my hand up and asking for help. I had to make every effort that I could. I still do it.

""I'm not out the woods now. I'm still the same Jodie, nothing much has changed.

""And that's all I can do - keep it honest and to the next person maybe give them hope that they too can do it.""

He is now part of a programme which tries to offer offenders, through the experience of former criminals, an alternative to a life of crime.

The judge

Image caption Judge Peter Fox said ""relative poverty"" had an effect on re-offending rates

The most senior judge on Teesside, Judge Peter Fox QC, says alcohol, drugs and the poor state of the economy has played a role in rates of re-offending in the north-east of England.

""I think time on a young man's or, for that matter, a young woman's hands is a very serious matter,"" he said.

""That's not to say there wasn't serious crime in this region when there was full employment, there was, but that was for different social reasons, I think.

""I think seeing a lot of luxury and affluence around you and not having any hope of having a slice yourself may be a factor.

""And then I pass a sentence which I hope will deter the person - but you can't lock everyone up.

The year in books,Here's my review of the year's crop of political books.,"[""Mark D'Arcy"", 'Parliamentary Correspondent']",None,"What did I learn from 2013's crop of political books?

It turns out some not very nice things were happening at the top of the Labour government; Benjamin Disreali was a bit of a one; Peers very seldom wear ermine and do a lot of work when no-one's looking; Sir Fred Goodwin spent a small fortune repainting the Royal Bank of Scotland's fleet of corporate Mercedes in the exact shade of blue on the RBS logo; fundraising for British political parties remains murky; governments of all colours keep on making the same expensive mistakes, and Nick Clegg played a very cunning game forming the Coalition…

One of the joys of presenting BBC Parliament's BOOKtalk is that I get to browse across subjects way beyond the immediate Westminster bubble ""must read"" list.

But for me the undisputed political book of the year has to be the book at the top of that list - disgraced spin doctor Damian McBride's occasionally terrifying account of his life and work in the court of Gordon Brown.

McBride... or McNasty, or McPoison, was a high functioning alcoholic when he became Chancellor, then Prime Minister Brown's conduit to the press, and a key player in the factional New Labour wars between Blairites and Brownites.

He gives an achingly vivid account of his role in New Labour's palace intrigues in his confessional memoir, Power Trip.

And he managed to shock even Westminster insiders who'd had an occasional glimpse of his activities.

Image copyright Biteback Publishing

Is it totally candid?

Probably not. Few in Westminster give away all their secrets, if only out of self-preservation.

But there are enough accounts of systemic leaking and brutal smears to provide a horribly revealing insight into the seamy side of political life.

And it's very well written.

The centrepiece is a devastating portrait of Gordon Brown, the leader in whose name McBride leaked and smeared.

It is warts 'n all stuff, tantrums and blame games, and ruthless court politics as well as flashes of leadership at the height of the credit crunch.

And there is a glimpse of the praetorian guard of young(ish) men around Brown, men who make up the politiburo of the post-Brown Labour Party: Ed Balls, Douglas Alexander and Ed Miliband, all jockeying for position.

The moment when Ed Miliband turns on McBride and refuses to believe he wasn't behind a leak against him is reminiscent of Prince Hal cutting Falstaff - ""I know you not, old man...""

There's a sense of McBride trying to purge his conscience through confession, and maybe establish himself as a kind of guru for recovering spin doctors, but I think it will be a long time before he's forgiven on earth, if not in heaven.

Less gaudy is Matthew D'Ancona's inside story of the Coalition - In It Together.

His central revelation is that the Conservative leadership always expected it might have to make a post-election deal with the Lib Dems, and had done a lot of the policy, if not personal groundwork.

Image copyright Viking Books

D'Ancona is obviously well plugged into the Camerons, at a personal as well as journalistic level, and the book is very much a Camerons-eye-view of events, with the quality of insider information from the Lib Dem side somewhat thinner.

The aim is clearly to provide the kind of insider account that Bob Woodward has written about successive US presidents, or Andrew Rawnsley gave of the Blair years.

But despite the sheer unfamiliarity of the Coalition, and the inherent divisions of a multi-party government, the result is somehow less gaudy.

Maybe the sheer venom of New Labour's tribal factionalism just isn't there.

Maybe, through force of circumstance the Coalition is simply more earnest.

But you do get a flavour of a government of chums, at least at the very centre - a social circle, D'Ancona says, before they became a political faction.

Required reading, but not the last word.

A less flattering view of the Coalition, or at least of its genesis comes from the Labour former transport secretary, Lord Andrew Adonis, who was a player in the frenetic negotiations which followed the 2010 election.

His book, Five Days in May traces the drama hour by hour, meeting by meeting, even text by text capturing the weird combination of fizzing excitement and total exhaustion both of the politicians and the media, following that gruelling campaign.

The villain of the piece, as he tells the tale, is Nick Clegg, who stands accused of being determined to join up with the Tories from the first, when a rainbow Coalition with Labour, eked out by the votes of smaller parties, was a genuine alternative.

Image copyright Biteback Publishing

I've never quite been able to buy this argument.

First, Clegg would have had to be prepared to sustain Gordon Brown in power for months, perhaps more than a year, when Labour had clearly lost the election, even if no-one had won it.

Second, a Lab-Lib combination would not have had a majority in the Commons - so it would have had to live hand to mouth, relying on the Northern Irish, the SNP and the rest, and prone to extortion at every turn.

Third, I'm not convinced Brown could have delivered his own party.

Maybe there were some left of centre soul-mates who could link hands across the Lib-Lab divide, but there were plenty on the Labour side in particular who loathed the Libs...

Fourth, if Brown was to go as Prime Minister, even after a few months, who would succeed him?

The Libs were being asked to buy a pig in a poke....

For all those reasons I find it hard to believe a Lib-Lab coalition would have been feasible, able to rise to the gravity of the economic crisis, or able to last very long at all.

The idea that if only Nick Clegg could have linked hands with Gordon Brown, the sundered tribes of the centre left could have united, the music would have come up and we would all have lived happily ever after, strikes me as quite fanciful.

But the speculation along these lines is almost the least important part of the book - it's fascinating about the mechanics of coalition negotiating (there's a wonderful moment when Peter Mandelson resorts to texting a Lib Dem negotiator sitting across a table from him, to try and get one of his colleagues to calm down....).

Adonis is critical of the final shape of the deal suggesting one of Clegg's biggest mistakes was failure to demand control of a big spending department, presumably health or education.

It's a fair bet that if the electorate vote in another hung parliament Adonis will find himself in another set of conference rooms, for another five days in May in 2015...

On the biography front, I enjoyed Douglas Hurd and Edward Young's Disreali, or, the Two Lives.

Some years ago, when he'd written his earlier book on Peel, Lord Hurd appeared on BOOKtalk and spent much of the programme laying into Disreali for destroying his hero, who was, he said, a much better man and a much braver politician.

BOOKtalk Christmas Special Mark D'Arcy and his guests Rachel Johnson, Sir Robert Rogers and Chris Bryant MP review some of the year's top political books. BOOKtalk is broadcast throughout the festive period on BBC Parliament or watch online. Watch on BBC iPlayer

His view hasn't changed and the Disreal who emerges from this rollicking account of Victorian politics is no statesman, merely a pot-boiler novelist, a sexual chancer, a cynical charmer and a political dilettante.

A more po-faced biography is Scott Berg's monumental account of a highly significant, but almost forgotten US President, Woodrow Wilson.

The astonishing tale of the stern academic who was catapulted to the governorship of New Jersey and then, almost without a pause, into the White House has very few parallels anywhere in political history.

Machine politicians wanted Wilson to be a Mr Clean front-man for politics as usual. Not only could they not control him, but they found themselves outmanoeuvred and side-lined.

Wilson was an effective reformer at state and national level and eventually - despite his slogan of ""too proud to fight"" - took America into the First World War.

He tipped the balance of the War and tried to shape the peace.

But then we come to one of the great ""what-ifs"" of US history.

Just as it looked as if he might persuade a reluctant country to join his creation, the League of Nations, he was laid low by a stroke.

For months his wife Edith governed the country through his staff - so that some scholars credit her with being the first woman president.

And by the time he recovered his enemies had defeated his plan, and America sank back into isolationism until 1940.

The best book by an MP this year is Conundrum, by the Conservative MP Richard Bacon, who sits on Parliament's formidable financial watchdog, the Public Accounts Committee.

Image copyright Biteback Publishing

His book poses the question why does every government get things wrong and what can be done about it?

Bacon yomps through a series of hyper-expensive public policy disasters: the National Programme for IT in the NHS; the Rural Payments Agency; the FE college building programme; recruitment of student doctors; the Child Support Agency.

And as each is examined there's a sense of déjà vu all over again, as the same mistakes are repeated.

His answers revolve around proper lines of accountability and clarity in setting objectives - but the clash between the demands of politics and of proper management are harder to resolve.

Anyone who wants to be in government - and anyone who already is should read this book.

The best book on Parliament is constitutional scholar Meg Russell's look at the modern upper house, the Contemporary House of Lords.

It can be a majestic sight... that glittering chamber full of gilt and heraldry, the hundreds of peers in their scarlet ermine-trimmed robes, but its actual work is poorly understood outside its own Chamber, even a few yards away in the Commons.

She describes an increasingly powerful and assertive House of Parliament, which has learned how to deploy its limited power to considerable effect and has become a shaper of laws and a dangerous nuisance - or should that be candid friend to ministers.

This shines a light on a seldom-examined but vital part of our law-making.

For those who like their history a little more distant, Tudor historian turned Tory MP Chris Skidmore has produced Bosworth the Birth of the Tudors - an account of the defeat and death of Richard III who was hacked to death in a Leicestershire field, fighting to defend his crown.

Legend has it that the crown in question was plucked from a bush and presented to his successor, ushering in a new era and a new dynasty...

Interest in the last Plantagenet monarch has been revived by the discovery of his body beneath a Leicester car park, and by evidence that he was indeed deformed, by a spinal condition, even if he wasn't the crookback of Shakespeare's plays.

Skidmore, the author of several books on Tudor history, has produced a lucid account of the successful invasion by the future Henry VII, recounting the manoeuvres and politicking around the doomed Yorkist regime, as Henry marched through Wales gathering support for his bid for the crown.

He's now working on a full-dress biography of Richard III and has even found some new source material to draw on.

Woolwich attack: Eyewitness accounts,,[],5/28/2013 10:03,"The brutal murder of a serving soldier in Woolwich in broad daylight has shocked the country.

The prime minister has flown back early from France to lead the government's response to the suspected terrorist attack and security across London barracks has been stepped up.

But for the people who witnessed it, going about their daily lives in this corner of south east London, it will be a day they never forget.

At around 14:00 BST on Wednesday afternoon, witnesses reported seeing a car crash on Artillery Place, off John Wilson Street.

One eyewitness, who wishes to remain anonymous, told the BBC he had been walking his dog when he heard shouting about 50 yards away.

'Animals'

""A man was running down the road and being chased by a car. The car then screeched to a halt and two men got out - one had some kind of sword.

""They literally swung at the other guy's head.""

Graham Wilders told the BBC he was driving home and arrived on the scene to find a car crashed into a wall and a man on the ground.

""Two people were lying over him and I thought they were trying to resuscitate him,"" he said.

Mr Wilders said he drove on to park his car, and when he returned another witness told him the two men were stabbing the man on the ground. He said he saw one man carrying a gun.

Another anonymous witness said ""two black guys"" came out of the car together and ""the white guy was in a white t-shirt with Help for Heroes on it"", indicating the victim's link to the armed forces.

""They grabbed the guy towards the wall then stabbed him - stabbed him, stabbed him, cut his neck, and then dragged him into the middle of the road,"" he said.

'Give comfort'

Speaking on LBC radio a man called James, who was at the scene, described the attackers as ""animals"".

""These two guys were crazy,"" he said. ""They dragged the poor guy - he was obviously dead, there was no way a human could take what they did to him.""

Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.

One of the surprising facts about the attack was that there were so many eyewitnesses, with the men making no attempt to flee and encouraging people to take pictures of them and their victim.

Another eyewitness, Joe Tallant, told the BBC the two attackers asked people on the street to call the police: ""They wanted to get caught.""

Lucky Awale, a local Muslim resident who has lived in the UK for 18 years, said she was ""very, very scared"" by what she saw.

She said one of the men was standing by the body talking as if he was ""mad"", adding that it was hard to make sense of what he was saying.

She said he claimed to have acted ""in the name of Muslims"", but she said this was ""not right. It's not Muslim. We don't accept it.""

The men were said to have been shouting Allahu Akbar (God is Great) as they carried out the attack.

'In full control'

At the scene some people tried to help the victim. One witness saw a woman ""trying to give him comfort"", while other reports say a group of women formed a circle to shield the body from further attacks.

Mr Tallant said the attackers made it clear no men could come near the body, only women.

Cub scout leader Ingrid Loyau-Kennett, 48, used the time before the police arrived to talk to the attackers and try to draw their attention away from attacking anyone else, particularly children in the area.

Mulgrave Primary School, located very close to the incident, was ""locked down"" by head teacher David Dixon, after he saw the body lying in the street.

After her encounter with one of the assailants, Ms Loyau-Kennett told the Daily Telegraph: ""He was not high, he was not on drugs, he was not an alcoholic or drunk, he was just distressed, upset. He was in full control of his decisions and ready to do everything he wanted to do.""

The police armed response unit is reported to have take around 15 minutes to get to the scene, something some witnesses have criticised.

'I was shaking'

When it arrived it ""mounted the kerb"", one witness said and ""blocked the road off"".

Another described how the attackers responded to the police presence.

She said: ""We saw the black bloke come up with a gun so we've moved back and the black bloke had two - I don't know what they were - meat cleavers I call them and he ran towards the police response car so they shot him.

Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.

""Then the other one looked like he was going to lift the gun up so they shot him as well. I was shaking.""

Julie Wilders, whose nine-year-old son attends Mulgrave Primary School, said the police had no choice but to shoot the man.

""They didn't even get the chance to get out of the car. He just ran to them so they shot him. They had to. It was either them or him,"" she said.

The two men were taken to hospital and are now under arrest.","['car', 'men', 'attack', 'woolwich', 'attackers', 'told', 'scene', 'javascript', 'man', 'saw', 'eyewitness', 'body', 'witness', 'accounts']","The brutal murder of a serving soldier in Woolwich in broad daylight has shocked the country.

The English We Speak / Cyberbullying,Is there someone tormenting you online? Here's an expression for when people hide behind a computer to attack others.,[],None,"Summary

Rob and Feifei talk about an expression from this age of digital communication. It describes negative behaviour using electronic devices. Find out more in the programme.

Transcript

Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.

Rob

Hello and welcome to The English We Speak with me Rob…

Feifei

…and me Feifei. Hello.

Rob

In this programme, we're talking about an expression that's appeared in the age of the internet. And it's connected to social media. So Feifei do you communicate with other people a lot on social media?

Feifei

Yes, I do. I love chatting with my friends and meeting new people… some people are mean though. They write very negative messages attacking others… it's nasty!

Rob

It is. And it's something we call cyberbullying. That's a form of bullying in which people harass and harm other people online deliberately. And unlike the traditional bully, the electronic bully can remain anonymous. So we don't know who they are.

Feifei

Cyberbullying includes things like spreading lies and rumours online, sending or forwarding unpleasant messages via instant messaging, text or on social networks.

Rob

Yes. It's becoming very common among teenagers these days. There are campaigns against cyberbullying and some places have adopted laws to prevent it. Let's hear examples of how this expression is used.

Examples

Kate is a victim of cyberbullying. It's so bad she doesn't want to leave the house. Someone from school has put messages on social media saying she's ugly and she should die. It's terrible!

Experts say people should protect themselves from cyberbullying by not taking everything to heart.

Feifei

Well, this last example includes some good advice.

Rob

Indeed. Experts advise you not to give out your own or friends' personal information and know how to block or report people who behave in an improper way.

Feifei

And when you send messages to people, be careful about what you write and post online. And don't share an unkind personal comment or image. Remember that though you think you have just a computer in front of you, on the other side of the screen there is a real human being.

Rob

So be safe and happy online. Enjoy social media.

A woman charged in a deadly hit-and-run crash in Las Vegas was once praised for overcoming a rough childhood and homelessness, it has emerged.

In a video, Lakeisha Holloway describes finishing school and working at a good job after being raised by an alcoholic mother and living on the streets.

Police said she had struggled since the 2012 video and was living in her car with her daughter before the crash.

One woman was killed in the crash and more than 30 people were hurt.

Prosecutors on Tuesday formally charged Ms Holloway, 24, with murder.

She was also charged with child abuse because her three-year-old girl was inside the car at the time of the crash. The child was unhurt.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption More than 30 tourists were hurt in the crash along the busy Las Vegas strip

""I'm appalled at the callousness of this defendant's conduct and what appears to be an intentional act,"" Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson said.

Joseph Abood, a lawyer for Ms Holloway, said she plans to plead not guilty to the charges. Ms Holloway was on suicide watch while she was being held without bail, police said.

Police said they did not know why Ms Holloway, originally from Portland, Oregon, drove into the crowd on Sunday and it appeared that she was not intoxicated.

Jessica Valenzuela, 32, of Buckeye, Arizona, was killed and three others remain in a critical condition in hospital.

The non-profit Portland Opportunities Industrialization Center, which helps at-risk youths with education and job training, had given Ms Holloway an award in 2012 and featured her in one of its promotional videos.

The person in the video is markedly different to the woman who told police on Sunday that she ended up broke on the Las Vegas Strip, ""a place she did not want to be"".

Ending the criminalisation of soliciting for sex in England and Wales could lead to one of the most tectonic shifts in how prostitution is seen in society since it was first made illegal nearly 200 years ago. But what is it like to sell your body for sex in London?

On Friday a cross-party group of senior MPs called for soliciting by sex workers to be decriminalised in what would be radical changes to the laws on prostitution.

This will most likely be welcome news to London's estimated 32,000 sex workers who, charities say, are less safe as a result of the criminalisation of their trade.

Jenny Medcalf says she started selling sex in 2004 when an ex-boyfriend suggested it.

At the time she was working as an actuary, struggling to keep up with the childcare costs for her three children and mortgage payments on her house in Surbiton.

The Durham University graduate says after a difficult marriage and a string of ""not so great"" boyfriends, she wound up with a different boyfriend who got her into BDSM - an abbreviation for bondage, discipline, domination, submission, sadism and masochism.

""I desperately needed the money, "" says Jenny, 47. ""I thought I was making a controlled decision to go into sex work to meet my financial needs and I could run it like a business.""

Her ex initially organised the bookings and was present for her first punter, she says.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sex tends to be sold in Soho and Paddington, both on the street and by appointment in brothels

The graduate says she advertised online and would visit men in hotels or their houses.

""I wasn't the traditional type of escort you would see. I was really thin with cropped hair, completely flat-chested and quite boyish but I was offering a BDSM service.""

A recovering alcoholic, Jenny says she used drugs to disassociate herself from the emotional and physical toll the job took on her.

After five years working in the industry, there was one moment when she knew she wanted out.

""This guy had me in a cage and he was trying to whip me through it. I swore at him, shouting. I never saw him again, although he wanted to see me. It was a turning point.

""The job had completely broken me.""

She says the idea she was in control had ""gone completely"" and at that stage, she hated herself.

Like women on the street, she says she was going to a client and then on to her dealer - but rather than a £10 rock of crack she was buying £300 worth of speed after a two-hour booking.

The situation became untenable when, unable to face opening her post, she slipped behind on mortgage payments and lost her house - along with her three children, her cats and all of her possessions.

After attempting to kill herself, using drugs and turning to drink again, Jenny met the man who went on to become her husband, whose patience she says helped to give her the strength to transform.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Women working to sell sex on the street are in danger of being taken out of sight and attacked, Jenny says

One morning during her recovery, she woke up and a ""light bulb"" went off in her head that she wanted to work with sex workers with addictions.

She started volunteering at the Spires charity in Tooting and is now one of the charity's most prominent workers. She goes out on to the street at night to find and help people - largely women - who are working as prostitutes.

On the street, these women get around £20 for full sex - but the price can also be as low as £5.

Sex workers in the Lambeth area 307% Increase in the number of women known to Spires from 2011 to 2015 284% Increase in the average number of new women seen each month between 2011 and 2015

She offers them warm clothing, sweets, crisps, condoms - and support. Jenny and her colleagues visit the sex workers, sometimes in hospital, or prison, often in the middle of the night.

""I fight for the women,"" she says. ""A number are the same age as me. They are me, but they are still in it.

""I respect them as women, I love them as women and I can see they can be so much more than they are at the moment,"" she says.

Out of the core 200 women known to the charity, seven exited the profession in 2013 and 10 in 2015.

However, selling sex can also be a positive thing, according to one Londoner in her 30s who works privately in a centrally-located flat.

Alice (not her real name), previously a project manager for a large government organisation, started selling sex seven years ago.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Many sex workers on the street have lost their children, often as a result of drug addiction and chaotic lifestyles

A friend introduced her to an escorting website when she was ""short on cash"", she says.

She sells sex to men, women and couples, along with elderly and disabled people. Intimacy and ""skin on skin"" contact is a ""natural, biological way to make us feel good"", she says.

After having had a middle-class upbringing, she says when she first started the work was a ""revelation"".

""I couldn't believe I was being paid to enjoy my favourite pastime,"" she says.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Women selling sex on the street are more likely to be dressed in warm clothing and wearing flat shoes than the glamorised idea perpetuated by the media

Her friends, most of her family and her partner, who she describes as the love of her life, know about her work and ""completely accept it"", although they were worried about her safety at first.

She says she has never been subject to violence but has occasionally been harassed by clients who became overly emotionally attached.

While the stigma of the work can make it difficult, she says, her clients are ""nice, ordinary people"".

""I do not need rescuing,"" she adds.

Alice's and Jenny's stories are played out on a larger scale across the country.

A 2015 survey by the NUM foundation and Leeds University found 71% of the sex workers who took part had previously worked in health, social care, education, childcare or the charity sector.

Alex Feis-Bryce, director of services at the NUM foundation, says that rise has, in part, been caused by cuts in recent years to public sector jobs and charities.

People are attracted to the flexibility of the work, he says.

Image copyright Richard Mutton Image caption Spires said it had seen a steep increase in the number of male sex workers in south London

Forty-five per cent of the 240 contributors to the survey, which ran between November 2014 and January 2015, sold sex alongside holding down another job.

""Something we are seeing more and more of is private escorts being stalked and harassed - we saw a 188% increase in the numbers of cases between 2014 and 2015,"" he adds.

Alex says these workers are often blackmailed by people taking advantage of their situation and the need to remain anonymous - threatening to tell partners or employers.

Shrinking funding for services helping sex workers meant the situation was pretty ""grim"", he adds.

Of course, sex is still sold on the streets of the capital. However, the idea perpetuated by Julia Roberts' character in the 1990 blockbuster Pretty Women, of risqué dressing and glamour, is not generally reflected by so-called streetwalkers in London.

Women selling sex on the street are more likely to look like a friend, an aunt or a mother - they tend to be wrapped up warm, as standing on a street all night is cold - and wearing comfortable shoes, not the killer heels often seen in the media.

Image copyright Met Police Image caption Met commander Christine Jones says she wants to stop exploitative individuals making money in the ""most appalling ways""

They are not likely to be heavily made-up.

Met Police commander Christine Jones says she often finds women working within the sex trade are there as a result of coercion, a lack of choices, and vulnerability.

She says she tries to put the care of women at the ""heart of everything"", as it is the punters who create the demand and bring violence and anti-social behaviour to communities.

She says targeting people who exploit women and buy sex is ""at the top"" of the Met's agenda - rather than taking the women into custody. ""I think that is a really important message to get across,"" she adds.

Image copyright Minamon Image caption Criminalising punters puts sex workers' safety at risk, says Laura Watson at the English Collective of Prostitutes

But the story on the ground is perhaps not so cut and dried, according to Laura Watson, a spokesperson for the English Collective of Prostitutes.

Laura says she hasn't seen police moving away from targeting sex workers.

""We are fighting cases where women are being hounded by police officers,"" she says.

She says the women she works with ""do not trust"" the police to look after them once they report a violent crime. Some have been threatened with arrest when they do so, Laura adds.

And in reality, targeting the punter rather than the worker has a similar ""detrimental impact"" to sex workers' safety as they are forced underground, she says.

Image copyright Minamon Image caption Women get around £20 on the street for full sex

Laura adds: ""Women are more likely to go into different areas they don't know just to pick up clients, or their negotiating time could drop as the client is worrying about being caught so all of the safety measures are diminished.

""Terrible things happen as a consequence of that.""

She says most of the women are mothers and so can't afford to stop working.

And the number of people turning to prostitution has increased since the recession, due to benefit sanctions and job cuts, she says. This means women who were once sex workers are returning to the profession.

Another facet of criminalisation means women struggle to find other work, Laura adds, so it is harder to leave should they choose.

Whether or not the MPs' recommendations make it into legislation remains to be seen - and any such move would almost certainly be reserved for a calmer period in UK politics.

Although some, like Alice, are able to make prostitution work to their advantage, many struggle with the reality of making a living out of something so intimate.","['copyright', 'caption', 'workers', 'seen', 'image', 'work', 'street', 'selling', 'sex', 'women', 'london']","Image copyright Richard Mutton Image caption Former sex worker Jenny says she fights for women selling sex on the streets.

Why we need a 'nudge' in the right direction,"In this week's Scrubbing Up, economist Professor Paul Dolan says government has a role in ""nudging"" our behaviour in the right direction.","['Professor Paul Dolan', 'Department Of Social Policy', 'London School Of Economics']",None,"Image caption What makes you choose to have that extra drink?

Whether or not we opt for ""healthy"" choices is largely down to our environment according to the LSE's Professor Paul Dolan. In this week's Scrubbing Up, he says government does have a role in ""nudging"" us in the right direction.

Did you have a couple of beers too many again at the weekend? Did you skip the gym again last night? Did you buy and then devour that giant size chocolate bar on special offer for a quid?

Such choices might make you happier, but they might not.

In fact, you might be behaving in all sorts of ways that are not consistent with your overall happiness. And, as an academic interested in human behaviour and happiness, I care about that.

I care that, as a result of lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol misuse and poor diet, many people get sick and die prematurely.

Behaviour 'not thought about'

Policy-makers care too, of course. For decades, they have provided us with more information about health risks and have used a range of financial and legal incentives that change the consequences of our behaviour.

But these interventions can only get us so far, and they nearly always widen the health gap between rich and poor.

In contrast to models of rational choice suggesting that we respond to information and incentives in very considered and thoughtful ways, recent behavioural insights suggest that human behaviour is actually led by our emotional and fallible brain, and influenced greatly by the context or environment in which many of our decisions are taken.

Behaviour is not so much thought about; it simply comes about.

At the same time as the limitations of traditional approaches have become apparent, policies that change the context or ""nudge"" people in particular directions have captured the imagination of policy-makers.

I have been involved in translating the lessons from the behavioural sciences into practical policy tools. There are some particularly robust effects that influence behaviour in largely automatic ways, which we have gathered up under 'MINDSPACE', and which is now being used by policy-makers when thinking about effective nudges.

These are the ways we are influenced:-

M essenger - we are heavily influenced by who it is that communicates information to us. So HIV prevention interventions work best when information comes from people in a similar position.

'Choice architects'

Recent behavioural insights shift the policy focus from the idea of an autonomous individual making rational decisions to a ""situated"" decision-maker, whose behaviour is largely automatic and influenced by context and ""choice architecture"".

We should be doing what we can to construct an environment likely to improve wellbeing rather than worsen it Professor Paul Dolan,, LSE

This raises questions about who decides on this architecture and on what basis.

Many people dislike the thought of government intruding into areas of personal responsibility but they also realise that the state should have a role in behaviour change, especially when one person's behaviour has consequences for another person's well-being.

So we don't want the government to stop us enjoying a few beers with our mates, we do want them to do something about anti-social drinking on the streets.

There are some complex political and ethical issue here but one thing is certain - we are being influenced - and influencing others - all the time.

The choice environment is rarely neutral and ""choice architects"" will always be shaping decisions whether they like it or not.

Given the importance of context on our behaviour where possible, we should be doing what we can to construct an environment likely to improve wellbeing rather than worsen it.

It is hard to disagree with that.","['nudge', 'need', 'environment', 'direction', 'behaviour', 'ways', 'work', 'likely', 'information', 'shape', 'increase', 'right', 'hiv', 'influenced']","In this week's Scrubbing Up, he says government does have a role in ""nudging"" us in the right direction.

Woolwich murder: Who are the suspects?,"What do we know about the two men arrested over the murder of a serving soldier in a street in Woolwich, south-east London on 22 May?",[],None,"Image caption Michael Adebolajo (centre) appeared in court in Kenya in 2010 on suspicion of planning to join a terrorist group

One of the two men held over the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in a street in Woolwich, south-east London, on 22 May was previously arrested in Kenya, the Foreign Office has confirmed.

Michael Adebolajo appeared in court after reportedly preparing to train and fight with Somali militant group al-Shabaab in November 2010.

He is currently being treated in hospital after being shot by police before his arrest in Woolwich.

Michael Adebowale, who was also shot at the scene, has been discharged from hospital and taken into police custody.

Police have never formally named the pair but their identities are now well known.

Michael Adebolajo

Minutes before the men were arrested in Woolwich, one of them was filmed by a member of the public with his hands bloodstained and holding a knife and meat cleaver.

Sources have told the BBC he is Michael Adebolajo, 28, from Romford, in east London.

Mr Adebolajo left school in 2001, where he was described as bright.

Havering Sixth Form College in Hornchurch, Essex, told the BBC a student named Michael Adebolajo studied for A-levels there from 2001-03.

The University of Greenwich has confirmed records show Mr Adebolajo was registered as a student between 2003 and 2005. It said his academic progress was ""unsatisfactory"" and he did not complete his studies there.

Like the other suspect, Michael Adebowale, Mr Adebolajo is a Briton of Nigerian descent and a convert to Islam.

Mr Adebolajo is understood to come from a Christian family and converted after attending university.

A neighbour from Romford, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Guardian: ""They were very pleasant, a very ordinary normal family.""

His family moved to Lincolnshire, where a house in Saxilby was searched after the attack and residents say Mr Adebolajo spent some time there.

He's been very outspoken about his concerns and grievances before and he has been arrested for those beliefs as well Mizanur Rahman on Michael Adebolajo

The address is believed to have been where he, his parents, and his younger brother and sister lived, according to local people, although it appears he may have moved away some time ago.

Mr Adebolajo's family issued a statement of condolence to Drummer Rigby's family.

""As a family, we wish to share with others our horror at the senseless killing of Lee Rigby and express our profound shame and distress that this has brought our family,"" it said.

""We wholeheartedly condemn all those who engage in acts of terror and fully reject any suggestion by them that religion or politics can justify this kind of violence.""

The statement added: ""We unreservedly put our faith in the rule of law and, with others, fully expect that all the perpetrators will be brought to justice under the law of the land.""

Sources have told the BBC Mr Adebolajo was known to the security services.

He is said to have attended demonstrations of the now-banned Islamist group al-Muhajiroun.

Mizanur Rahman, who was jailed after a 2006 protest against cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad, told the BBC he was sure the police would know who Mr Adebolajo is.

""He's certainly not a lunatic who's hiding his beliefs,"" he said.

""He's been very outspoken about his concerns and grievances before and he has been arrested for those beliefs as well.""

Footage uncovered by the BBC shows Mr Adebolajo taking part in an al-Muhajiroun demonstration in April 2007 against the arrest of a man from Luton.

He can be seen standing in a crowd of men outside Paddington Green police station, holding a placard reading Crusade Against Muslims.

In pictures from 2009, Mr Adebolajo can be seen at a counter-demonstration to a march held by the right-wing English Defence League in north-west London.

A member of the public has told the BBC she saw Mr Adebolajo handing out leaflets and preaching in Powis Street, in Woolwich, a main shopping street.

A friend of his, Abu Nusaybah, who said he met him in Romford in early 2002, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme he noticed ""a change"" in Mr Adebolajo when he returned from a trip to Africa last year.

He said his childhood friend had been detained by security forces in Kenya.

The Foreign Office later said Mr Adebolajo had been arrested in Kenya in November 2010 and it gave consular assistance ""as normal"" in the circumstances before he was deported.

Mr Nusaybah said MI5 asked Mr Adebolajo to work for them after he returned from Kenya, but he refused.

Human rights group Cageprisoners Ltd said Mr Adebojalo approached it last year to complain he and his family were being ""harassed"" by British security services.

Mr Adebojalo and his family claimed they had received numerous phone calls, text messages and visits from British security agents pressuring them to co-operate, Cageprisoners said.

ITV News has said it understood that Mr Adebolajo became a father a few days before the attack.

In the footage from Woolwich obtained by ITV News, the man says in a London accent that as long as British troops are in Muslim countries ""you people will never be safe"" and ""We swear by almighty Allah we will never stop fighting you"".

Ingrid Loyau-Kennett, a cub scout leader who confronted Mr Adebolajo after the attack told The Daily Telegraph: ""He was not high, he was not on drugs, he was not an alcoholic or drunk, he was just distressed, upset.""

Michael Adebowale

The second suspect, 22-year-old Michael Adebowale, grew up in south-east London.

According to the father of Damilola Taylor, the schoolboy stabbed to death in Peckham in 2000, Mr Adebowale's mother is a probation officer and his father a representative at the Nigerian High Commission.

Mr Taylor told ITV News he acted as a mentor to Mr Adebowala, who was known to his friends as Toby.

Image caption Michael Adebowale was photographed brandishing a knife and speaking to a woman at the scene

He said he had known him since the age of 10 after his mother got in touch to say he was experiencing problems in school and was being bullied.

""He was a young, loving boy"" but later it appeared there was issues around gangs and drugs, said Mr Taylor.

He said he last spoke to Mr Adebowale about two months ago. He told him he had changed his ways after becoming a Muslim.

A story in the Guardian said Mr Adebowale was stabbed in January 2008, when a man attacked him and two friends at a flat, killing one of them.

Sources have told the BBC he was known to the security services.

At the time of the Woolwich attack, Mr Adebowale was understood to have been staying with his girlfriend in her flat on a Greenwich housing estate later raided by police.

Nicola James, who lives in the same block, said he had been there for ""at least the last three weeks"", while another neighbour confirmed he had seen both suspects at the flat ""two or three times"".

One resident said he often saw Mr Adebowale in the lift and described him as a ""nice, quiet guy"".

Another said from what he knew of Mr Adebowale, ""he wouldn't go from a normal bloke to doing that. He must have been brainwashed into doing it.""

According to a report on Sky News, he was among a group of men who preached from a stall on a shopping street in Greenwich from 2012 and store owners report seeing him detained by police about two months ago.

Cub scout leader Ingrid Loyau-Kennett said she also spoke to Mr Adebowale at the scene of the attack and described him as ""much shier"" [than Mr Adebolajo].","['security', 'murder', 'arrested', 'adebowale', 'woolwich', 'told', 'family', 'bbc', 'michael', 'suspects', 'adebolajo', 'mr']","Michael Adebolajo appeared in court after reportedly preparing to train and fight with Somali militant group al-Shabaab in November 2010.

"Newspaper headlines: Assange guard, Stones' TVs and hoverboard law","The decision to end the round-the-clock police guard at the embassy where wanted Wikileaks' founder Julian Assange has been since 2012, the Rolling Stones' TV needs and hoverboards feature in Tuesday's papers.","['Rob Corp', 'Bbc News']",None,"The Metropolitan Police's decision to end its round-the-clock guard at the Ecuadorian embassy in central London, where Wikileaks' founder Julian Assange has sought refuge since 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden, is covered in most of the papers.

""The sight of these empty steps will delight fugitive whistleblower Julian Assange"", says the Daily Mirror, beneath a picture of the embassy entrance where police officers once stood in case the 44-year-old Australian decided to leave.

Image copyright Getty Images

""Taking the Wiki"" is the Sun's headline. The paper says the Met believes the cost of guarding the embassy is ""no longer proportionate"".

The Times reports that maintaining the police operation since June 2012, when Mr Assange first entered the embassy having failed to persuade the UK Supreme Court to block his extradition, has cost the Met £12.6m. The force will now focus on ""covert surveillance"", the paper says.

The Daily Telegraph says Scotland Yard ""has admitted it cannot guarantee"" the arrest of Mr Assange should he step out of the embassy's front door. Mr Assange's lawyers, the paper adds, ""have claimed that if he was sent to Sweden he would subsequently be at risk of being extradited to the US, where he believes he would face persecution for Wikileaks' disclosures of sensitive information"".

The Daily Mail poses the question ""what happens next?"" While three of the four Swedish sexual assault allegations he originally faced when he fled to the embassy have expired after reaching their five-year limit for prosecution, he faces one allegation of rape. However, that too will expire in 2020, and the Mail says Mr Assange is ""considering sitting out the remaining years as well"".

Ecuadorian officials ""reportedly considered smuggling [Mr] Assange out of the embassy by disguising him in fancy dress, allowing him to hop across the Kensington rooftops to a helipad, or become lost in the crowds in Harrods"", reports the Guardian, citing Buzzfeed UK.

Eye-catching headlines

""Sweeter beers for generation brought up on sugary drinks"" is the troubling headline for any beernoisseur in the Daily Telegraph. In a troubling throwback to the alcopops ""revolution"" of the 1990s, analysis for the Grocer magazine finds the market share of sweet-tasting alcoholic drinks has risen 50% in the past decade. ""Drinkers new to alcohol with 'sweeter palates' are opting for mojito or guarana beers"", says the Telegraph. This is enough to drive your paper reviewer to drink.

""We're too tired, say French elite police"". The Times reports French officers responsible for protecting the country's politicians ""are so tired they risk shooting a VIP by mistake"". While the police are banned from going on strike, the officers are suing the government because ""overwork was undermining their concentration and causing accidents"". Officers have accumulated 1.3 million hours of overtime as well, for which they have not been paid.

""Court battle over 'stolen' Jimi Hendrix guitar valued at $1m"" - The Independent reports on a lawsuit filed by Hendrix's estate, calling on a guitar shop owner in Arizona to return the Acoustic Black Widow instrument, which it alleges was ""stolen by an erstwhile member of Earth, Wind and Fire"". But the current owner's lawyer has told an Arizona newspaper his client bought the guitar ""in good faith from a private seller"".

""Brew-haha over mum putting 172 Teasmades up for sale"", reports the Daily Express. It's quite a boast, but Sheridan Parsons of Royal Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire, has ""the world's biggest collection of the once-trendy bedside automatic tea makers"". The BBC cannot independently verify that claim, but would like theirs white with two sugars, please.

Labour 'chaos'

Papers of the left and right reflect on shadow chancellor John McDonnell's U-turn over the government's charter of fiscal responsibility.

Having backed the plan, which would force future administrations to run a budget surplus during ""normal times"", the Guardian reports Mr McDonnell has written to Labour MPs saying ""things have moved on"" amid ""economic challenges facing the global economy as a result of the slowdown in the emerging markets"".

The Sun says Labour has been ""plunged into chaos"" and anonymous ""insiders"" have told the paper Mr McDonnell ""may not have clearly understood what he was committing Labour to"". However, the shadow chancellor has said signing up to the budget charter ""could restrict a future Labour government from borrowing to invest in national infrastructure"".

Image copyright AFP

According to the Daily Mirror ""Labour had originally hoped to amend the charter to allow borrowing for investment, but were told by Commons clerks the changes would not be possible"".

The Daily Mail says Labour's change of heart is ""a serious blow"" to its ""remaining credibility"" and quotes Chancellor George Osborne as saying the opposition's policy ""has lurched from chaos to incredibility"".

Writing in the Independent, Labour MP Chuka Umunna - a member of the shadow cabinet before Jeremy Corbyn won the party leadership - accuses Mr Osborne of staging a ""political stunt"" by launching the budget charter, saying he had branded previous attempts to force governments to run budget surpluses as ""vacuous and irrelevant"".

What the commentators say

Start me (TV) up

Time was when the most a rock star wanted from their hotel room TV was the gratifying sound it made when it crashed into the ground after being tipped out of a penthouse suite window.

But as rockers age, their requirements change, and the Daily Telegraph reports as well as a ""never-ending flow of alcohol and cigarettes"", the Rolling Stones requested a set of written instructions on how to use the electronics in their hotel rooms during a recent US tour.

The Times takes things further: there was also a demand for after-hours dry-cleaning services, the paper says. This ""could perhaps indicate plans for wild debauchery, but could equally betray the natural concern of men in their eighth decade who wish to dress properly for dinner"".

Laundry aside, the Independent reports that BBC creative director Alan Yentob hopes to feature an historic gig by the Stones in Cuba for his arts strand Imagine. Mick Jagger has been ""filmed dancing at Cuban nightclubs and visiting areas of Old Havana as he scouted potential venues"", the paper says.

Hoverboard hoo-ha

You've as much chance of bumping into a hoverboard (pictured above) within the pages of Tuesday's papers as on the streets of the UK. Fleet Street cannot get enough of the craze which means there are numerous headlines based on variations of ""hover"" and ""bovver"".

It's an announcement about the legality of using hoverboards (or ""self-balancing scooters"", or swegways) that has brought them to the attention of the daily press.

""Using a hoverboard on a pavement is illegal"", says the Daily Mail, while the Daily Telegraph believes ""the 180-year-old Highways Act"" could stop the craze in its tracks. The Sun adds that they should only be used on private land.

""When Marty McFly travelled to the year 2015 in Back to the Future, he jumped on a hoverboard to escape his arch-nemesis Biff,"" waxes the Times. ""Had he been in England or Wales he would have been arrested.""

The Independent's Rachael Pells has test driven one of the £599 contraptions.

Like a line from Craig Thomas's Cold War novel Firefox, Pells writes, ""I was amazed at how intuitive the board is - to turn a corner all I had to was use my mind"". Her only issue was coming to a stop: ""I froze with the same panic of stopping oneself from a fall and the board stopped too. This was a revelation.""

The Guardian dedicates part of its leader column to the ""self-balancing platforms with wheels at each end"", asking why anyone would want one?

""They don't actually hover. They are not the enchanting air surfboards that Back to the Future promised us... it is anarchic in an infantile way"", says the paper, before declaring owners of swegways are ""making a statement that they are rich enough or lucky enough not to have grown up"".

As voters go to the polls in the general election, the papers take the opportunity to deliver their final messages on the front pages.

The BBC, like other broadcasters, is restricted to reporting only factual accounts of the election in line with polling day rules.

With the election understandably hogging the headlines and dominating the opinion, it leaves an eclectic mix of other stories in the papers.

While the country goes to the ballot box, the Times reports on another slightly less weighty poll.

The paper says ornithologist and writer David Lindo has organised an online vote, which closes at midnight, to find Britain's favourite bird.

The Times says feathers will certainly be ruffled and may even fly if the robin is selected, as it has done previously.

For Mr Lindo favours the blackbird and has expressed disappointment that the robin is the odds-on favourite.

Image caption The robin: Very territorial and quite violent

Mr Lindo says the robin's friendliness to humans does not extend to other birds and they are known to kill not only other members of their species but other species who enter their territory.

Robins are ""very territorial and quite violent, even the females,"" he says.

On the front of the Times, there is a warning from psychologist and government adviser Prof Sir Cary Cooper that emails are sapping the life out of Britain's workforce and contributing to a lack of productivity.

Sir Cary says British productivity is the second lowest in the G7 group of nations partly because the country embraces digital technology ""a bit too enthusiastically"".

IT staff should shut down servers to discourage employees from checking and replying to emails in the evenings and at weekends, so that they arrive fresh for work on Monday morning, he argues - adding that checking inboxes on holiday is ""sick"".

The Times says he told the British Psychological Society conference in Liverpool: ""Emails now dominate us. People think when they have checked their emails they have done a day's work. Emails are not work - they are getting in the way of real work.""

Ultra-smooth frontman

The papers mark the passing of the lead singer of Hot Chocolate, Errol Brown, who has died at the age of 71.

In an obituary, the Telegraph says the group's funky and harmonious sound was defined by Brown's seductive voice and charismatic stage presence.

""Bald-headed and slinky-hipped, Brown was a master of the art of the come-hither look (and gently come-hither lyrics),"" it says.

The Guardian recalls that the band, who got together in Brixton, had fans in high places and in 1981 they played at a pre-wedding bash in Buckingham Palace for Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer.

Image copyright PA Image caption Bald-headed and slinky-hipped Errol Brown

The Independent says the ultra-smooth frontman of Hot Chocolate became one of Britain's most successful musicians.

""With their irresistible bass lines and seductive vocals, the band were the uncontested disco kings of the 1970s and 1980s,"" it continues.

""After a less-than-stellar solo career, Brown and his former bandmates enjoyed a revival when You Sexy Thing featured in The Full Monty.""

""With his distinctive moustache and shaved head,"" says the Mail, ""Brown entered the Top 10 with the band in 1970 and went on to have more than 20 chart successes - many of them written by the father of two.""

'Astonishing gift'

The Times tells the tale of a millionaire businessman who disliked travelling at sea, who has left two classic Ferrari sports cars worth a total of £8m to the RNLI.

The paper says Richard Colton, who died in March at the age of 83, was a regular if nervous passenger on board cross-channel ferries as he often drove his classic cars to rallies and other events in Europe.

The RNLI says the proceeds from the sale of the cars will be used to pay for a new lifeboat named after Mr Colton and his late wife Caroline.

The Telegraph says Mr Colton bequeathed the proceeds from his ""lifelong passion"" in what could become the most generous gift the charity has received.

Image caption Richard Colton was a supporter of the RNLI for at least 25 years

""Although there is no official estimate on the cars, two similar vehicles recently sold for a total of £8m,"" says the Telegraph.

""An equivalent sum would make the bequest the most generous legacy ever accepted by the RNLI, following an anonymous gift of £7.4m in 2013.""

The Mail says Mr Colton collected and raced classic cars for 40 years but friends said he was always nervous on boats.

Calling it an ""astonishing gift"", the Express says the Northamptonshire businessman, part owner of the Colton Brothers shoe empire, had been a member and supporter of the charity for at least 25 years and even put an RNLI sticker in the back window of his 250GT.

In an editorial, the Express says: ""Britain's coast will soon be safer thanks to Richard Colton. What a wonderful legacy for such a very worthwhile organisation.""

Cashing out, cashing in

Very often in the paper review we have a section called ""making people click""... well now experts believe they have found what makes dolphins click, in more than one sense.

The Times reports that marine researchers have discovered that dolphins engage in complex social networking just like humans.

The paper says a study of about 200 bottlenose dolphins along the Indian River Lagoon in Florida found that the animals exhibit both preference and avoidance behaviour, selecting who to associate with, and who to shun.

Elizabeth Murdoch Titcomb, a research biologist at Florida Atlantic University, says: ""It's really interesting, especially now with the popularity of human social networks like Facebook, to also see how social networking applies in the dolphin community.

""There is a lot to be learned from establishing who hangs out with who, and where and when.""

The fermented honey drink, it continues, with a solid claim to being the oldest alcoholic beverage in the world, is undergoing a renaissance with sales rising on both sides of the Atlantic.

Producers of the tipple say a combination of the fantasy TV series Game of Thrones and the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta has refreshed the drink in people's minds.

Alesha MacPhail murder: The schoolboy who became an opportunistic killer,"Aaron Campbell told a psychologist he was ""quite satisfied"" with the opportunistic murder of Alesha MacPhail.","[""Paul O'Hare"", 'Bbc Scotland News Website']",None,"Image caption Campbell admitted thinking about doing ""something excessive"", including rape, in the 12 months prior to the murder

Aaron Campbell was looking for cannabis when he entered the flat and discovered Alesha MacPhail sleeping in her bed.

For the duration of his trial he had denied ever meeting the six-year-old, let alone being responsible for her abduction, rape and murder.

But as Campbell, 16, faced a criminal psychologist, who was preparing a pre-sentencing background report, he finally admitted one of the most horrific crimes in Scottish legal history.

The detail of his account was chilling.

It was known Campbell left his home on the Isle of Bute after a party as he wanted to get ""stoned"".

He had previously bought cannabis from Alesha's father and had been to the flat where he lived on Ardbeg Road, Rothesay.

The jury heard that a key had been left in the door in the early hours of 2 July last year.

What remained a mystery was why Campbell took Alesha from her bed?

It has now emerged that in the 12 months prior to the murder the teenager thought about ""doing something excessive"" including rape.

And when he set eyes on the child he saw it as a ""moment of opportunity"".

Campbell told the psychologist: ""At any other time in life, murder wouldn't have been the conclusion. If I was a year younger I don't think I would have done it.

""All I thought about was killing her once I saw her.""

Image caption Campbell told a psychologist how Alesha woke after he had carried her from her room

Image copyright Facebook Image caption Robert MacPhail and his girlfriend Toni McLachlan with Alesha

There were emotional scenes in the public gallery at the High Court in Glasgow as more horror was heaped on Alesha's family.

They heard the schoolgirl was initially ""drowsy"" but as Campbell carried her out of the flat and along the shoreline she became more awake.

Alesha asked who he was and where they were going.

Campbell told her he was a friend of her father and that he was taking her home.

He even gave the child his top as she was cold.

The details of what happened at the end of their journey were, mercifully, not aired in court.

But as Campbell was sentenced it was disclosed he told the psychologist he was ""mildly amused"" police took two days to arrest him after Alesha's body was discovered.

'Quite satisfied'

The teenager also admitted he had to ""zip his mouth"" to stop himself laughing during the trial.

Perhaps the most disturbing revelation he volunteered was that he was ""quite satisfied with the murder"".

It was an astonishing about-turn for a killer who had initially lodged a special defence of incrimination in which he blamed 18-year-old Toni McLachlan, the partner of Alesha's father.

This was particularly cruel as she was old enough to be named in the media while he remained anonymous, until that restriction was removed after the verdict.

Prosecutor Iain McSporran QC branded the schoolboy a ""confident liar"" who had spun a web of deceit.

When Campbell was convicted by a unanimous jury verdict last month he did not show a flicker of emotion and remained impassive in the dock.

He wore the same blank expression as he was ordered to spend a minimum of 27 years in prison and warned he may never be released.

Lord Matthews described him as a ""cold, callous, calculating, remorseless and dangerous individual"".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The murder shocked the island community

Family life

Campbell had first appeared on the police radar shortly after midnight on 3 July last year

The previous morning Alesha's naked body had been discovered in the grounds of a former hotel on the Isle of Bute.

It was Campbell's own mother who contacted detectives after reviewing footage captured by the CCTV cameras outside the family home on Ardbeg Road, about a mile outside Rothesay, the main town on the island.

After being sworn in as the first defence witness Campbell said he had lived on Bute since the age of four or five with his parents and younger sister.

A previous police statement shown on the court screens confirmed he was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, on 7 May, 2002.

His father Christopher, 42, was a supervisor in the oil industry and often worked away from home.

Campbell's QC, Brian McConnachie, questioned the accused about his relationship with his mother Janette, 54.

He said they argued, normally when she was drinking.

Asked if she had a alcohol problem, Campbell said: ""I would say so. I don't know about now but certainly back then.""

Mr McConnachie later described his client's upbringing as ""less than ideal"" but stressed there were no mitigating factors which could explain his appalling crime.

Emotional state

Campbell had spent Saturday 30 June camping on Ettrick Bay to mark the first weekend of the school holidays.

The following day he used Snapchat to invite 15 friends to a party at his home, a seven-bedroom detached property which looks onto the Firth of Clyde.

That night the teenager told the court he drank a bottle of Mad Dog fortified wine and shared a bottle of Echo Falls wine with a friend.

He said: ""I got drunk. I was not sick. I was just having a good time.""

But as the party drew to a close, at about 00:30 on 2 July, his mood changed.

Campbell admitted: ""I was quite upset as my mum had been arguing with me most of the night.""

A close friend found him in an emotional state and recalled he was ""suicidal"".

The 16-year-old friend said Campbell blamed his mother's drinking for his mood.

He told the jury: ""I felt quite worried for him.""

The friend eventually managed to calm Campbell down before they parted company.

Cannabis debt

At the time of his arrest last summer the teenager claimed he was only smoking the Class B drug once a month.

Campbell named Alesha's father, Robert MacPhail, and his girlfriend, Toni McLachlan as two of the people who had supplied him with ""weed"".

But in February 2018 he fell out with Mr MacPhail, 26, over the quality of his product.

This resulted in an unpaid debt of £10.

Given Campbell's dealer was 10 years his senior, the episode was presented to court as yet another example of the teenager's arrogance.

In the early hours of 2 July Campbell tried to contact Mr MacPhail via Facebook Messenger.

He said: ""Then I remembered I still owed him a tenner so I messaged Toni instead.""

Neither responded so he headed for the flat the couple shared with Mr MacPhail's parents, which was a five-minute walk away.

He was armed with a kitchen knife but discarded it on the shore when he realised he could easily gain entrance to the property.

On his return the first bedroom he encountered at the top of the hall was Alesha's.

'Friends with benefits'

Campbell appears to have been comfortable in the company of girls and claimed he was sexually active.

In evidence he named two teenagers he had been ""talking to"" during his fifth year.

When his advocate, Mr McConnachie, asked what the term meant, he explained: ""It is kind of like the transition period between being friends and being boyfriend and girlfriend.""

In the winter of 2017 he told the court he became involved with Alesha's father's girlfriend, Toni McLachlan.

He said: ""Toni and I began seeing each other, not in a going out sort of way.

""I guess I would call it friends with benefits.""

Campbell claimed the sexual relationship enabled Miss McLachlan to frame him by planting his DNA at the crime scene from a used condom.

Lord Matthews later described his account as a ""cruel travesty of the truth"" and told the court Miss McLachlan was ""completely innocent"".

Horror games

Campbell owned a Playstation 4 and, according to his mother, was ""addicted"" to gaming.

From the age of 12 he wanted to be a YouTube star and posted footage on his channel, including clips of a nightmarish game called Slender Man.

Its focal point is a tall, faceless character who lives in the woods and stalks children.

Another, psychological horror PT, involved exploring a haunted house.

On the videos Campbell is seen playing games and commentating on what is happening.

After his conviction YouTube said it had taken down the footage as a mark of respect for Alesha and her family.

At school Campbell had a large circle of friends and his strongest subjects were maths and physics.

He planned to go to university and his dream was to design games.

The teenager was also a fan of parkour and posted videos online in which he showed off his skills on a trampoline.

To keep fit he lifted weights at home and in the gym.

He was strong for his age and, under questioning by Mr McSporran, said he could bench press 50kg.

The QC then told the court Alesha, who has just finished her second year at primary school, weighed 22kg.

The distance between her grandparents' home and the secluded spot where she was found would have taken up to 17 minutes to cover on foot.

Crucially, the post-mortem examination recorded 117 injuries on the child's body but not a single mark on her feet.

The prosecutor said: ""Alesha was carried to where she died. Toni could not have carried her. You could have.""

Campbell replied: ""I have no experience of carrying people. I have never carried weights for such a distance before.""

Fantasy kill chat

The trial heard from Campbell's friends that he had a dark sense of humour.

The jury was shown a transcript of a Facebook Messenger chat which had been initiated by a female friend after she watched a crime documentary.

During the conversation in 2017 Campbell wrote: ""Might kill 1 day for the lifetime experience.""

When he was asked about the comment during his evidence, he said: ""I think in the next message I said it would be more like a short lifetime experience because it would ruin your life if you killed someone. It would be a stupid thing to do.""

The morning after the murder Miss McLachlan messaged Campbell and asked him to keep an eye out for Alesha as she was missing.

The killer replied: ""Oh damn. Am sure she's not went too far x"".

That afternoon he filmed a video in his house which ended with his reflection being revealed in a bathroom mirror.

It was then shared with a Snapchat group with the caption: ""Found the guy that done it.""

As he sentenced Campbell, Lord Matthews highlighted the footage.

He told the the teenager: ""Your attitude was clearly demonstrated by the evidence that you posted an image of yourself in a mirror while making a joke that you had found where the murderer was hiding.

""The arrogance and callousness of that is breathtaking.""

Identity revealed

Before officers arrived at his home, the court heard Campbell's iPhone was used to Google ""How do police find DNA?""

Asked how he presented himself, Det Con Gavin McKellar replied: ""Confident. He was quite confident.""

Mr McSporran inquired if the accused seemed overawed or anxious.

The officer said: ""Not at all.""

His alibi was that he had gone out to buy cannabis from another teenager and at no point did he mention meeting up with Miss McLachlan.

Mr McSporran questioned why he gave the police a story that could easily be disproved.

Campbell answered: ""I guess I am not very good at lying.""

He was arrested on 4 July and driven to Helen Street police station in Govan, Glasgow.

Throughout his nine-day trial he could not be named as he was under 18.

After his conviction media outlets, including the BBC, launched a successful legal bid to reverse the court order which had protected his identity.

During the hearing the court was told the teenager had a history of self harm, anxiety and depression and he had been previously tested for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

He does not suffer from any mental health disorders of syndromes but Lord Matthews later observed Campbell was ""completely lacking in victim empathy"".

The teenager will be held at HM Young Offenders' Institute Polmont, near Falkirk, until he turns 21.

He will then be transferred to the adult prison system where he will not be eligible for parole until 2045.

But before he was led from the dock, the judge told him: ""Whether you will ever be released will be for others to determine but as matters stand a lot of work will have to be done to change you before that could be considered.

""It may even be impossible.""","['copyright', 'teenager', 'macphail', 'murder', 'killer', 'caption', 'image', 'court', 'aleshas', 'told', 'alesha', 'opportunistic', 'campbell', 'schoolboy', 'toni']","Image caption Campbell admitted thinking about doing ""something excessive"", including rape, in the 12 months prior to the murderAaron Campbell was looking for cannabis when he entered the flat and discovered Alesha MacPhail sleeping in her bed.

Scotched Earth: Who controls Scotland's economic levers?,There's not much doubt about the direction of travel of the Scotch whisky industry.,"['Douglas Fraser', 'Business', 'Economy Editor']",None,"Image caption Two business experts have suggested the introduction of a whisky bottle tax

There's not much doubt about the direction of travel of the Scotch whisky industry.

The start of last year saw exports dip as higher French taxes kicked in, but distillers are assuming the longer-term trend is strongly upwards.

So in an industry that has to produce now for consumption in five to 15 years from now, they're splashing around the investment.

The world's biggest spirits company, Diageo, last year committed another £1bn of investment over the next five years.

After opening Roseisle distillery near Elgin in 2009, with capacity to make 35 million bottles a year, it's just opened its new bottling hall at Leven in Fife, with plans near there for a big expansion in warehousing.

It says it needs at least one more like Roseisle, and a dozen smaller distilleries are having capacity increased.

Pernod Ricard, the industry's number two, better known in Scotland as Chivas Brothers, is ramping up production as well, expanding existing distilleries and reopening Glen Keith ten years after it was closed.

It has about 60% of Roseisle's capacity.

Barrels of business

In other words, it's a good time to be a coppersmith in Scotland, and not a bad time to be working in a cooperage either.

Along with producer Craig Williams and cameraman Alan Harcus, I was at the Craigellachie distillery recently to film for a documentary, Scotched Earth, which was broadcast this week and is still available on iPlayer.

It showed not only that there's a lot of demand for repaired casks, but it's also a fascinating example of how piecework motivates productivity.

The 14 coopers working there (one of them a Hungarian barrel-maker called Attila, who turned up on his Harley-Davidson one day, looking for work) never stop for a moment, least of all to speak to each other.

Despite the growth in production, the number of jobs doesn't appear to be growing by much. Direct employment remains below 11,000, according to industry figures.

Roseisle operates round the clock on a workforce of only 12 people.

The industry recently put out figures boasting that it's got higher worker productivity than any other industry other than offshore oil and gas, and better than the City of London's financial sector. But that's because you can make so much with so few people.

Bottle tax

And that's why the documentary looked not only at the success of Scotch exports, but asked about the benefits coming back to Scotland.

Venerable business experts Professor John Kay and Sir George Mathewson, both former members of the Scottish government's Council of Economic Advisers, on the government to look at introducing a bottle tax.

They're arguing that that would be a means of getting more value for Scotland and sharing some of the distillers' big profits with the country from which this product has to be produced.

And Sir George pointed out this is not a debate about tax powers: they may already exist, as Holyrood has powers over regulation and pricing of water - the ingredient in whisky which, unlike barley or casks, has to come from Scotland.

Image copyright Other Image caption Despite growth in production, the number of whisky jobs doesn't appear to be growing by much

This has caused quite stir in recent days. Gavin Hewitt, of the Scotch Whisky Association, described it as ""completely harebrained""; why tax success, and why make a product more expensive in markets where distillers of other spirits are eager to knock Scotch off its premium perch?

The Greens' Patrick Harvie liked the idea. Tories hated it. The Scottish government says it's not looking at it, though SNP MPs took divergent lines on it.

One clarification worth making: there's been some confusion about the idea of a bottle tax and the current tax on whisky.

The tax already paid is mainly a consumer tax, and it varies from one country to another. As the main part of the cost of a bottle of spirits, the UK Treasury only gets to tax the 10% or so of production that's sold in the UK, and of course, it charges VAT on top of that alcohol duty.

The other source of tax at present is corporation tax levied on the profits made by distillers, and that should apply to all the production of Scotch.

However, big corporations are rather good at moving the value of production to tax jurisdictions where they pay the lowest possible tax.

It's not clear how much this applies to the multinationals which dominate Scotch whisky. Diageo says it pays 18% tax on profits in the average year, but doesn't break down where that's paid.

The bottle tax proposal differs from these other sources of taxation as being a tax that's levied on production for UK markets and for export. It would not be directly levied on consumers or on profits, but is more easily collected, as it's linked to the volume of whisky as it leaves the distillery or bottling hall.

Modest jobs

The undercurrents of this issue of a bottle tax are several bigger questions about the Scottish economy, particularly in the context of the debate on Scottish independence.

First, how much control can any government have over internationally-mobile business? The Mathewson/Kay argument is that whisky stands out against other products because distillers have to be in Scotland to make it, so here's an opportunity to take advantage of that leverage. You can't, by contrast, do that with electronics or cars.

Second, how would an independent Scotland treat international investors? As a source of tax revenue, expected to share the benefits of operating in Scotland? Or as a source of jobs, however modest the numbers might be?

Third, why are the people who control Scotch whisky overwhelmingly based elsewhere? And fourth, does that matter?

Foreign control

Diageo has more than 35% of the whisky market, and if it can secure control of India's United Distillers, including Whyte & Mackay, that will push up to 40%. (A report in the Sunday Herald suggests that Indian regulators are sticking their oar in as the Delhi authority resists, yet again, opening up to foreign ownership. This debate about foreign control of economic assets is raging much more ferociously elsewhere).

Image caption Scotland whisky industry generates billions each year

Pernod Ricard in France, has around 20%. LVMH, with Glenmorangie, Remy Cointreau, which recently paid a whopping £58m for Bruichladdich distillery on Islay, and Japan's Suntory which has Morrison Bowmore, contribute to another 20%.

There are newcomers on a small scale based in Scotland, along with two Scots headquarters for bigger players, William Grant and the Edrington Group, combined representing around 20% of the industry.

The Business Scotland radio programme this week has also looked at the industry's past, present and future.

The view I found, in widespread discussions, was that, whatever the criticisms of big distillers for taking the benefits of Scotch whisky's success in very large profits, these same companies brought professionalism, marketing expertise, global distribution networks, and it's turned around the industry's dire position in the 1980s.

Tartan ring fence

And while the industry's doing well, it seems a friendly business environment, where smaller players are happy to work with the bigger ones, swapping stock and benefiting from the marketing and advertising reach worldwide.

As part of that investigation, economic commentator Alf Young looked back at where this debate about foreign ownership has come from.

He puts the takeover of Distillers Company in 1987 by Guinness, later to become Diageo, amid the other fundamental changes in the economy at the time, as Royal Bank of Scotland fought off takeover by HSBC, and heavy industries faced huge job losses and closures.

Even in business circles, the issue then was whether to put a ""tartan ring fence"" around strategically-important Scottish businesses.

As he puts it, neither of the two alternatives at that time looked attractive: foreign ownership or oblivion.

It was oblivion for some sectors, foreign ownership for others, and an opportunity for other Scottish firms to go out and acquire business overseas, including, as it happens - and with disastrous consequences - Royal Bank of Scotland.

And to quote Alf Young: ""It's extraordinary we're having this debate about independence, and we don't have a debate about the independence of our corporate base"".

Every university 'needs' Alcoholics Anonymous meetings,,[],2018-07-31 16:54:32+00:00,"Image copyright Getty Images

Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings should take place in universities across the UK, student leaders have said.

Charity AA says the number of younger people attending their meetings is on the increase.

NUS Wales president Gwyneth Sweatman said Cardiff University's sessions for problem drinkers, one of the first of its kind, have made a big difference.

One student said the help she received turned her life around.

Cardiff undergraduate ""Marie"" said alcohol pushed her life at university to the edge.

At her lowest ebb, she drank 15 pints of cider a day, was arrested and risked being kicked off her course.

She said: ""It was affecting my work significantly.

""I wasn't concentrating in meetings, I couldn't focus, I was erratic in my behaviour and my decisions.""

""I wasn't turning up, it was having a really negative effect on my mental health and that was spiralling, really awful anxiety and depression and suicide-based thoughts.""

The latest official data suggest young people are drinking less.

However, Dr Mani Mehdikhani, a trustee at Alcoholics Anonymous, said the number of younger attendees at meetings was on the up.

""Looking at our own internal AA surveys that we conduct every five years, every time a survey is undertaken we have increasingly larger numbers of younger people coming as new-comers to AA.

""The last survey in 2015, about 33% of our newcomers were under 40 and I'm sure a big percentage were in the university student-age group.""

Image caption The weekly AA meeting at Cardiff University's student union is for anyone who wants to stop drinking.

Cardiff University also has a student counselling and a well-being team which provides support for ""some of the underlying difficulties associated with, or directly linked to, alcohol misuse"".

Jennifer Kent, a vice president at the union, said: ""For us it feels like a really good way of integrating the students and the community here, and it's also important that, by bringing it here, the students don't feel stigmatised.""

NUS Wales president, Gwyneth Sweatman said she thought the AA meetings idea was ""absolutely brilliant"", and one which she would ""love"" to see replicated across the UK - similar to the United States, where college campaigns AA meetings are more common.","['student', 'anonymous', 'meetings', 'alcoholics', 'younger', 'universitys', 'really', 'wasnt', 'aa', 'wales', 'needs', 'university', 'president']","Image copyright Getty ImagesAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings should take place in universities across the UK, student leaders have said.

Alcoholics Anonymous was founded 80 years ago. It has spawned a host of other groups dealing with every manner of compulsion, writes Chris Stokel-Walker.

""My name is Peter and I'm an alcoholic.""

It's a familiar phrase even to those who have never attended a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous. When Peter introduces himself to 40 others in a small room just off Newcastle's main shopping thoroughfare, on a sunny Saturday morning, he receives a warm welcome back in unison.

Everyone here shares a drink dependency, though they come from hugely different walks of life. The format of the meeting is simple - an introduction, a reading, one member explaining their story, then a free-for-all discussion for others to share their concerns, their triumphs, and their thoughts.

Peter began to drink at the age of 11. ""By the age of legal drinking in the UK I was being admitted to local alcoholic units; in and out of doctors; in and out of police cells. Everything in my life really deteriorated."" But Peter hasn't tasted alcohol in 34 years, and he attributes his sobriety to Alcoholics Anonymous.

All members talk about ""working through the 12 steps"" that form the cornerstone of the programme. The first of the steps, published four years after AA began, reads: ""We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable.""

The 12 steps outline a plan of recovery to overcome addiction, which involves submitting to a higher spiritual power and admitting that alcoholism is an ongoing problem. Founded by Bill Wilson and Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio, AA grew out of a Christian organisation - the Oxford Group.

The group is marking 80 years from the moment Wilson helped Smith - 10 June 1935 was the latter's last drink. That social element of AA, the importance of ""sponsors"" in the process, is as well known as any of the steps.

Today, there are 115,326 Alcoholics Anonymous groups in 175 different countries, according to the group's latest estimates, with more than two million members. There are 60,143 groups in the United States alone.

According to a study in 1998, 90% of private substance abuse treatment centres based in the US model their treatment on the 12 steps. The principles have provided a basis for other 12-steps groups with no affiliation to mainstream AA.

THE 12 STEPS

We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable

Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity

Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him

Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves

Admitted to God, to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs

Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character

Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings

Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all

Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others

Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it

Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out

Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs

These include Narcotics Anonymous, the more specific Marijuana Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Workaholics Anonymous and Sexaholics Anonymous.

Clutterers Anonymous deals with those with hoarding problems. Underearners Anonymous offers support for those suffering an ""inability to provide for one's needs"". Support for loved ones of those going through addiction is on offer at Families Anonymous.

On Monday alone there were four Narcotics Anonymous meetings in Manchester, a Marijuana Anonymous meeting in Fitzrovia, central London, and an Overeaters Anonymous session in Cannock. For some of the smaller groups, if there's no dedicated meeting available, addicts are advised to go to AA as a substitute.

Across England, Wales and Scotland, 687 different Alcoholics Anonymous meetings took place on Monday, with 113 chapters coming together in London alone.

""If you look at any 12-step programme, the only significant difference really is the first part of the first step,"" says Peter, who attends AA meetings and organises Emotions Anonymous meetings in the North East of England.

The latter group deals with issues as diverse as low self-esteem, resentment, fear, anger, indecision, perfectionism, forgiveness, depression, grief, shame and anxiety.

""I think there's a fellowship for every particular human condition,"" Peter jokes. ""But I can understand that, because apart from the first part of the first step, the rest of the programme is a programme for living.""

Image copyright Other Image caption AA meeting depicted in the House of Cards

Most fellowships offer Skype sessions, where you'll be greeted in the same way, any hour of the day by welcoming peers always happy to listen, and you'll say the same words: ""My name is… and I'm addicted to …""

""The 12 steps are very applicable to any other addiction,"" says Amy Krentzman of the University of Minnesota's School of Social Work, who has conducted research into Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programmes.

""They modify the language, but it's the same basic programme, the same basic steps, and other people have got well from following them.""

The ""helper"" theory, first coined in the 1960s, helps explain AA's efficacy, says Krentzman. The helper ends up feeling better too. Most, if not all, of those running 12-step groups are themselves undergoing treatment for addiction.

In countless movies and TV shows - from the Sopranos to Mad Men to House of Cards to the West Wing - the sponsor-addict relationship crops up. Sponsors act as a spiritual, emotional and practical guide.

Treatment is always ongoing in AA, unlike some other traditional rehabilitation programmes which offer short programmes followed by the addict coping largely alone.

Marijuana Anonymous has ""exactly the same format"", explains Thomas, a member. ""It has the 12 steps, and various stories that illustrate the practical application of those steps, and stories from people who have gone through the experience and gone sober.""

These spin-off groups are not explicitly endorsed by Alcoholics Anonymous World Services (AAWS), which oversees the organisation's copyrights. But AAWS does grant permission for groups to use the 12 steps.

And AA's principles are still regularly criticised. Some dislike the quasi-religious element, others the emphasis on complete abstinence rather than the possibility of moderate consumption. There's also a new film - The 13th Step - about sexual assaults carried out by AA members on other members.

But perhaps the greatest criticism is from those who want concrete evidence that this widely accepted programme actually produces results.

""The evidence is that it works very well for some people,"" says Krentzman. A review of scientific studies of Alcoholics Anonymous' success in aiding sobriety in 2006 found that ""no experimental studies unequivocally demonstrated the effectiveness of AA"".

Dr Lance Dodes, a former substance abuse treatment specialist, wrote in a book about 12-step programmes that: ""Alcoholics Anonymous was proclaimed the correct treatment for alcoholism over 75 years ago despite the absence of any scientific evidence of the approach's efficacy, and we have been on the wrong path ever since.""

Another bone of contention is that porting across the 12-step programme to other areas offers cultural legitimacy to the idea of a wide range of compulsions as addictive diseases.

Scientists continue to be divided over whether food addiction really exists. They are torn as to whether sex addiction is real or not. It does not, for example, appear in the American Psychiatric Association's list of mental disorders.

But for many, the programme is effective. Krentzman notes: ""It works because of a psychological process, a social process, a spiritual process. Because of the way it gives people a sense of community and knowing other people who have the same problem.""

That's something Jennifer, who attends Overeaters Anonymous, agrees with. She joined the group in 2008, when she was 37 years old and 17-and-a-half stone. Today, she is at a more manageable weight, and attributes that to her ongoing relationship with the fellowship of overeaters.

""When I'd been to therapists and they were telling me to try things, they had no experience of it themselves,"" she says. ""There's something about one addict helping another addict. There was an authenticity to what they were saying.""

""It's a very simple programme for complicated people,"" Thomas says, ""and it seems to withstand a lot of questioning from outside and within, which can't be said for a lot of rehab philosophies.""

In the AA meeting in Newcastle, 40 people sit and share stories of addiction. Aftewards, there are firm handshakes and friendly conversations - smiles and shared jokes.

One by one, they file out the door into the crowds toting shopping bags, looking like anyone else. But in their mind, they carry an extra weight with them throughout the week.

Sir Anthony Hopkins opens up on alcohol battle,,[],2018-07-27 09:28:17+00:00,"Image copyright Greg Doherty / Getty Images Image caption Sir Anthony Hopkins shared advice with students at the University Of California

Sir Anthony Hopkins has opened up on his battle with alcoholism, saying he ""should have died in Wales, drunk or something like that"".

The Oscar-winning star admitted he was ""very difficult to work with"" early in his stage career because he ""was usually hungover"".

He said he turned his life around following a talk with a woman from Alcoholics Anonymous in 1975.

Sir Anthony, 80, was born in Port Talbot but now lives in Los Angeles.

Speaking to about 500 students at the University Of California, the Silence Of The Lambs star discussed his problems with alcohol and the impact it had on his early career.

He said: ""Because that's what you do in theatre, you drink. But I was very difficult to work with, as well, because I was usually hungover.""

Sir Anthony added he had been ""disgusted, busted and not to be trusted"" while he was drinking.

The actor told how he started to change following the talk with the Alcoholics Anonymous woman, who asked him ""why don't you just trust in God?"".

From then on the urge to drink was ""never to return"", he added.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sir Anthony - pictured with Dame Diana Rigg in 1972 - said alcohol affected his early career

Sir Anthony, who was knighted in 1993 for services to the arts, said he got into acting ""because he had nothing better to do"", adding he was ""not at all bright"" in school and was often bullied.

""I believe that we are capable of so much,"" he told the students at the 11th annual Leap, Leadership, Excellence and Accelerating Your Potential conference.

""From my own life, I still cannot believe that my life is what it is because I should have died in Wales, drunk or something like that.""

He now lives in Malibu with his actress wife, Stella Arroyave, and advised students to ""say yes to everything. Say yes and take the risk"".

Sir Anthony is widely considered to be one of the world's greatest living actors and is perhaps best known for his portrayal of cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter in 1991's The Silence Of The Lambs, its sequel Hannibal and prequel Red Dragon.","['alcohol', 'anthony', 'students', 'hopkins', 'image', 'work', 'sir', 'usually', 'yes', 'opens', 'wales', 'early', 'life', 'woman', 'battle']","Image copyright Greg Doherty / Getty Images Image caption Sir Anthony Hopkins shared advice with students at the University Of CaliforniaSir Anthony Hopkins has opened up on his battle with alcoholism, saying he ""should have died in Wales, drunk or something like that"".

What happens in an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting?,"Members of Alcoholics Anonymous are marking its 75th anniversary, but what really goes on inside the group's meetings?","['Finlo Rohrer', 'Bbc News']",None,"Image caption The true nature of alcoholism is a controversial subject

Members of Alcoholics Anonymous are marking its 75th anniversary, but what really goes on inside the group's meetings?

David looks, in a word, respectable.

Bespectacled, and in a polo shirt and khaki shorts, he could be any respectable middle-aged man.

He sits in a circle of other respectable-looking people in a church hall in a well-to-do part of Washington. Without knowing the context, as he prepares to speak, one might guess that this was a heritage group, ready to save a historic warehouse, or a meeting of concerned residents, demanding traffic-calming measures.

Instead, when David opens his mouth, he starts to talk about his first use of drugs at the age of 12.

Later he talks about his conscious decision to drink himself to death.

Easy eloquence

There is the revelation of small-time drug smuggling trips to South America and a life of profound lows.

But he has an easy eloquence.

""I have fond memories of the moronic quality of being drunk,"" he says.

People do feel shame and guilt when they do things that are bad - in AA you learn to be shameless and guiltless Jack Trimpey , Rational Recovery

""My story is getting far away mentally. It is almost like the Peloponnesian War now.""

The others in the group also speak enthusiastically, talking of trials and tribulations, of their relationship to drink and how they came to be part of AA.

One gum-chewing, room-dominating woman contrasts life as a high-powered sober Washingtonian with her previous pre-AA life in a series of expansive arm gestures. Another man quietly and movingly recounts his son's troubles with the law.

It's impossible to say whether these individuals were always raconteurs or whether their storytelling matured as they took the 12 Steps.

'Higher power'

Certain lines provoke laughter in the group.

""The only thing I knew for sure about my problem was it wasn't a drinking problem,"" deadpans one man. ""I knew you had to drink too much to have a drinking problem and I could never drink enough.""

Image caption The AA dates its foundation to its co-founder's last drink

There are other phrases that are reverentially repeated. Life became ""unmanageable"" and a ""higher power"" has been at work.

A 70-year-old salesman talks about a life where money was made in computers but years were lost to vodka.

A woman talks of her travels and a reassuring fact. ""There are rooms like this all over the world where crazy people get to talk.""

Of the 11 men and three women in the room, eight have been sober for more than 20 years.

And their meeting is in a long tradition that stretches back to 10 June 1935, to the day Robert Smith - better known as Dr Bob - had his last drink. He had been working with AA co-founder Bill Wilson, now usually referred to as Bill W.

Fictional depictions

The organisation they created has helped millions give up drinking and rebuild their lives.

And the meetings, with the 12-Step Programme that is at the heart of AA, are familiar even to those who have had nothing to do with the group.

The higher power is not just the god of your understanding it is the people in the room Stan, Recovering alcoholic

Countless depictions on film and television have familiarised people with what goes on at the meetings and the familiar formulation ""I'm X and I'm an alcoholic"".

The organisation has its critics. There are those who disagree with the founding idea that alcoholism is a disease, a compulsion that the individual can do nothing about.

Others dislike the Christian nature of the group. The 12 Steps talk of God ""as you understood him"".

Jack Trimpey, who runs his own programme Rational Recovery, is a trenchant critic.

""We do object that it is a bad religion, one in which people profess powerlessness against their bodily desires. We are not powerless. We have a moral duty to cease and desist once it is shown.

""It has been a massive inversion of public thinking that has entered the mainstream media.

""People do feel shame and guilt when they do things that are bad. In AA you learn to be shameless and guiltless.""

He prefers to call himself a former ""bad drunk"" and speaks of an alternative approach that calls for ""zero tolerance in the family"".

Having been sober for many year, he dislikes the typical AA attitude towards that.

""It's not an accomplishment - common decency is no accomplishment.""

Image caption Concerns about binge drinking are now common to much of the world

But for the people at the AA meetings, common decency - and everything else good in life - is an accomplishment.

Jonathan speaks of the single day in 1987 when he first had a moment of happiness. And he knows how it must be maintained.

""I pray and I meditate, and I couple that with working with other alcoholics.""

People at the group seem to have no problem with the varied application of the religious element of AA. There are atheist and agnostic groups, but it's hard to get away from the references to God in the 12 Steps that are at the heart of AA.

The softly-spoken Stan explains: ""The higher power is not just the god of your understanding, it is the people in the room.""

And those other people are the key, one woman admits.

""It works because everything I attempted to do about drinking by myself never worked.

""By coming into AA I was able to get support to not drink - people who think exactly like me, that common bond.""

Some ethnic minority alcohol support services have seen an increase in inquiries following a BBC survey suggesting that, despite Sikhism forbidding drinking, 27% of UK Sikhs had a family member with a problem.

They reported a rise in contacts from both alcoholics and volunteers.

Nottingham's Bac-In has seen an almost sixfold increase in website hits.

And UK Punjabi services the First Step Foundation and the Shanti Project have also seen an increase in interest.

Sohan Sahota, of Bac-In said: ""Average website hits are around 2,000 a month. We've had over 11,500 hits since the article.""

Jaz Rai, director of the First Step Foundation, which works with UK Punjabis across England, said it had doubled the size of its weekly support group and was planning a women-only meeting to address the increased demand.

The Shanti Project, which works to provide culturally appropriate services for the Punjabi community in Birmingham, has also seen an increase.

Tina, a British Punjabi mother-of-two, contacted the BBC after reading its coverage of the issue.

The reports resonated very strongly with her own experiences, she said.

Her husband - a heavy drinker - had been emotionally abusive towards her, Tina said, trying to convince her that she was going mad, and taking out loans in her name to finance his drinking after losing his job as a plumber.

""There's so much going on in Asian families that no-one addresses,"" she said. ""I just want our culture to open up.

""People need to wake up and realise that alcohol is poison,"" she said. ""I don't want my kids to go through what I went through. I don't want my daughter to think that it's normal.""

Sharing stories about addiction can play a key role in the path to recovery, according to Alcoholics Anonymous.

Recovering alcoholic Sanjay Bhandari told the BBC: ""The thing that resonated most with me was to hear other people's stories.

""What they experienced, what it was like, and how things got better gave me hope and inspiration, 'Well I can do that.'""

The BBC's coverage sparked a discussion on social media, involving Sikh MPs, support services, and people directly affected by the issue.

Talking about the issue openly was a good first step towards challenging cultural norms and tackling the problem head on, said Jasvir Singh, on BBC Radio 4's Thought for the Day programme.

""To overcome any fear of shame, it's important to look at alcohol misuse as a health condition and treat it with empathy and understanding rather than condemnation and judgement of the person or their family.""

Eminem has revealed he's been sober for ten years.

On Saturday, in between headlining Coachella, he posted a photo of himself with an Alcoholics Anonymous coin which signifies sobriety.

""Celebrated my 10 years yesterday,"" the rapper wrote on Instagram - which received more than 1.6 million likes.

Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, was addicted to prescription medication and nearly died of an accidental methadone overdose in 2007.

At the height of his addiction the rapper was reportedly taking up to 20 pills a day.

The 8 Mile actor credits his children for helping him recover and previously revealed he replaced addiction with exercise.

The 45-year-old said running and working out was key to giving him endorphins, which also meant he managed to sleep.

People tweeted him messages of congratulations, including rapper Royce Da 59.

Everybody thinks they know what an ""alcoholic"" is, but what about those who drink too much but fall short of the common definitions of alcoholism? Should there be a word that bridges the gap between alcoholic and non-alcoholic?

The term alcoholic - on its own to denote someone addicted to alcohol - was first used in 1852 in the Scottish Temperance Review.

Since then, millions of heavy drinkers have been confronted by friends and families with the stark question: ""Are you an alcoholic?""

And millions have denied it. Rejected the label. Confessed only to maybe, possibly drinking too much. But utterly denied the A-word.

Alcoholics are people who fall asleep in skips. Alcoholics get into fights. Alcoholics start the day with a shot of whisky. Alcoholics are drunk all the time. Alcoholics can't hold down jobs.

None of the above is necessarily true, but the intensely negative nature of the word alcoholic leaves some people scrabbling for an alternative.

""There is so much stigma,"" says Kate, author of the blog The Sober Journalist. People are so frightened of it - their head fills with images of men drinking under bridges. ""There is this huge number of people out there who don't fit that stereotype but perhaps their drinking isn't quite normal.""

Warning signs Image copyright Getty Images In their book Almost Alcoholic, Robert Doyle and Joseph Nowinski identify five signs that someone may be an ""almost alcoholic"": You continue to drink despite at least some negative consequences

You look forward to drinking.

You drink alone.

You sometimes drink in order to control emotional and/or physical symptoms.

You and your loved ones are suffering as a result of your drinking

Kate went to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings when she started to think she was drinking too much, about four or five years ago. ""I felt I was out of place, I wasn't alcoholic enough. I felt that everyone else had worse problems with drinking than I did,"" she says.

There are other words for people who drink a lot. There is everything from the lightly derogatory ""lush"" to the more flowery ""bibulous"" to the prosaic ""heavy drinker"".

But there is nothing as succinct as alcoholic. And some believe that this gap has an effect.

Professionals have started using other terms that would not be as negative as alcoholic because ""many doctors feel that it is quite difficult to engage a patient if you talk to them about alcoholism"", says Dr Sarah Jarvis, a consultant for Patient.co.uk.

People have such vivid mental images of what it means to be an alcoholic that they measure themselves against that standard and do not seek help.

""They all have an idea of what an alcohol or problem drinker is but there is a different pattern for every drinker,"" Jarvis says.

Not all experts share this view, however.

There's a danger that avoiding the term ""alcoholism"" will only serve ""to reassure people their drinking is OK when it isn't"", says Moira Plant, emeritus professor of alcohol studies at the University of the West of England.

Image copyright Hulton Archive Image caption The term inebriate was popular in the 19th Century

She agrees the widespread impression of the alcoholic as a vagrant or street-drinker prevents higher-functioning people with drink problems from seeking help. But she says the best way to tackle this is to correct false stereotypes, not downplay the situation faced by such individuals - many of whom are already in denial.

""People normalise heavy drinking,"" she says. ""They tend to overestimate what everyone else drinks. They say, 'I don't drink as much as my friends so it's OK.'""

There have been other words to describe someone drinking too much. In the 19th Century ""inebriate"" was a popular term and the word ""drunkard"" goes all the way back to the 15th Century.

England's Department of Health recommends that men should not regularly drink more than three to four units of alcohol a day and women should not regularly drink more than two to three units a day.

But drinking above these recommendations does not necessarily mean that the person is an alcoholic. It just means increased risk of health damage.

""An alcoholic is anyone who is dependent on alcohol and who is drinking to a level that will endanger their health,"" Dr Jarvis says.

The term alcoholic is very much alive in the vocabulary of ordinary people, says Tim Leighton, director of professional education and research at Action on Addiction.

""In Europe and in the UK, there was a move away from the term in the 1960s; it was seen as derogatory. We now talk about 'alcohol dependence', but you don't hear people in the street saying he is an 'alcohol dependent,' they say he is an 'alcoholic,'"" he says.

Dr Jarvis says it is a shame the words ""hazardous"" or ""harmful"" drinker aren't used more widely.

The issue with the use of the word ""alcoholic"" is that it is narrow. ""You are either one or you are not,"" Leighton says. ""This is why some people prefer the term 'alcohol dependence'. You can be an alcoholic without drinking too much - it is all about dependence, about losing control.""

For a long time, it was a strict category, there were specific criteria and if you fulfilled these criteria, you were an alcoholic, says Joseph Nowinski, one of the authors of the book Almost Alcoholic.

This is a stage for a lot of controversy - as long as you didn't meet the alcoholic criteria, you would say, ""I am not an alcoholic so I don't have a drinking problem"", he says.

""There has never been a word for people who come to the point of asking themselves the question, 'Do I have a problem or not?'""

Based on this, Nowinski and Robert Doyle came up with the concept of being an ""almost alcoholic"" to describe people who are not alcoholics but who ""fall into a grey area of problem drinking"".

""The almost alcoholic zone is actually quite large. The people who occupy it are not alcoholics. Rather, they are men and women whose drinking habits range from barely qualifying as almost alcoholics to those whose drinking borders on abuse,"" they wrote in the Atlantic.

""An expanded view of drinking behaviour in terms of a spectrum as opposed to discrete categories might be viewed by some as opening the door to over-diagnosing the associated problems. We believe the opposite will prove to be the case: that this paradigm shift will allow people to recognise problems earlier and to seek solutions without having to be labelled as alcoholics.""

""There is a huge range of alcohol problems,"" Leighton says. ""A lot of people with alcohol problems are not alcoholics.""

Until a new label is popularised there will be people who struggle to admit they have a problem, he says.

But for Kate, the existing term has come to make sense as her recovery has progressed.

""I feel that eight months ago I wouldn't have said that I was an alcoholic and now I could say I am because I know what it means,"" she says.

"Love in Recovery, Series 1, Fiona",An ex-banker worries she has more in common with the group than she would like to admit.,[],None,"A competitive and snobby ex-banker tries to come to terms with the fact that she might have more in common with the rest of the group than she would like to admit.

Comedy drama by Pete Jackson, set in Alcoholics Anonymous and inspired by his own road to recovery. Starring Sue Johnston, John Hannah, Eddie Marsan, Rebecca Front, Paul Kaye and Julia Deakin.

The programme follows the lives of five very different recovering alcoholics. Set entirely at their weekly meetings, we hear them get to know each other, learn to hate each other, argue, moan, laugh, fall apart, fall in love and, most importantly, tell their stories.

There are funny stories, sad stories, stories of small victories and milestones, stories of loss, stories of hope, and stories that you really shouldn't laugh at - but still do. Along with the storyteller.

In the first programme, Fiona (Rebecca Front), a competitive and snobby ex-banker, tries to come to terms with the fact that she might have more in common with the rest of the group than she'd like to admit.

Writer Pete Jackson is a recovering alcoholic and has spent time with Alcoholics Anonymous. It was there he found, as many people do, support from the unlikeliest group of disparate souls, all banded together due to one common bond. As well as offering the support he needed throughout a difficult time, AA also offered a weekly, sometimes daily, dose of hilarity, upset, heartbreak and friendship.

Inside an anonymous support group for the children of alcoholics,"Exclusive music news, big interviews, entertainment, social media trends and video from the news people at BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra.",['Declan Harvey'],None,"Newsbeat has been given rare access to an anonymous support group, Alateen, for children with alcoholic parents.

Self consciousness, feeling alone and feeling different are what's being discussed and could just be considered being part of being a teenager.

But where as most 16-year-olds will have the support of a parent to get them through, these teenagers don't.

It's estimated there a 2.6 million people across the UK dealing with alcoholic parents.

""Other people - they can go home and talk to their parents, who can help them,"" some of the group's members tell Newsbeat.

""But if we have a problem and [our parents] have been drinking they're not going to be fully there for us.

""They might be aggressive, they might be silent, they might not want to talk to us at all.""

We're gathered in a small room above a church hall. It's cold so we've all kept our coats on.

Here people discuss the feelings most of us have learned to hide.

Whoever is holding a Little Miss Chatterbox soft toy gets to talk.

Everyone's head nods when the topic of fake smiles comes up.

""I try not to fake smile any more,"" someone says. ""It's exhausting. It happens because I'm afraid other people won't understand.""

""It's been a bad week emotionally for me,"" someone else says.

""More things happened with my dad and brother.""

I get the feeling this is an update on something everyone here knows all about.

As Little Miss Chatterbox continues to be passed around we hear how ""my step-mom is still a bitch"" and ""I feel like I've lost my mum"".

But no-one seems shocked.

Although they've all had different experiences, they share common emotions.

Sadness is one of the main topics of this week's meeting - the other is peace of mind.

(We discuss sadness first because it's good to finish on the more positive topic, someone says.)

One girl explains how she's still battling depression.

In fact, she's adamant she ""wouldn't still be here"" were it not for Alateen meetings.

Just like Alcoholics Anonymous, which helps alcoholics recover, Alateen thrives on anonymity.

It makes people feel safe.

There's an echo of chatter coming from another meeting downstairs.

That meeting is an Al-Anon meeting, which helps slightly older relatives of alcoholics.

Alcoholism ""is a family disease because it affects all the members emotionally and sometimes physically,"" according to a page of instructions read out at the start of each meeting.

The group is also reminded weekly that ""everything that is said here must be held in confidence.""

As I watch the group interact it's clear to me they trust each other totally.

They also seem to genuinely like each other - there are jokes and as someone wells up, she's given a hug.

Suddenly, Little Miss Chatterbox is placed in front of me.

I thought I'd only be watching this evening but I get the feeling if I refuse to take part I'll somehow ruin the atmosphere.

So I share my thoughts of sadness and I'm surprised by how it feels.

The group listen to me intently. I don't get the feeling they are faking an interest or just being polite.

For a moment I forget about the job I'm here to do and open up.

It's a nice feeling - a mixture of nerves, adrenaline and feeling special.

As I talk I spot a card on the table in front of me. It's the Alcoholics Anonymous ""serenity prayer"".

God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,

Courage to change the things I can,

And wisdom to know the difference.

""Although we cannot change or control our parents, we can detach from their problems while continuing to love them,"" which is another quote from the group's instructions.

It's almost half nine, the meeting has run over a little (mainly because of my questions) and instead of feeling tired, I'm feeling uplifted.

Lynne who organises the group gives me a hug goodbye.

I think it's a sign of how emotional everyone is.

I take out my phone and call a friend but I struggle to explain how I'm feeling.

Perhaps that's the power of these groups, you have to go to understand.

Adrian Chiles 'horrified' at drinking 100 alcohol units a week,,[],2018-08-21 10:03:38+00:00,"Image caption Presenter Adrian Chiles speaks about alcohol after revealing he sometimes drank 100 units a week.

Presenter Adrian Chiles has urged people to track their alcohol intake after revealing he sometimes drank 80 or 100 units a week.

The BBC 5 live host said it was ""horrifying"" to add up his alcohol consumption, which was well over the recommended weekly 14 units.

He was told by a doctor he ""can't carry on like this"" and his liver damage could cause cirrhosis or death.

Chiles, 51, has tackled the issue of drinking in a new BBC documentary.

Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Chiles said: ""I was just staggered what I was putting away"".

He said most of his drinking was ""completely mundane and harmless"", adding: ""I don't really get drunk, I don't misbehave, I don't drink during the day, I don't drink alone, I don't particularly stay up late.

""I just drink something every day.

""There are loads of us who just drink too much and I just wondered why I was so dependent on it in a small way, or is it a big way.""

Chiles' comments have prompted many people to speak about their own drinking habits. Actress Linda Robson told ITV's Loose Women she thought ""maybe I could have been on the way to being an alcoholic"" when she used to drink a bottle of wine a night.

She said: ""My big thing was because I didn't drink in the daytime then I didn't have a problem and I could make myself wait until that time every night so I obviously didn't have a problem.

""But I was still functioning, I was still coming into work.""

'We are the problem'

Chiles - who sees himself as a social drinker and not an alcoholic - said he wanted to make the programme after being interested in people's ideas of what type of drinking counts as alcoholism.

For the documentary, called Drinkers Like Us, the TV and radio broadcaster recorded how many units he was drinking.

In an interview with the Times, he said on one morning he calculated that he had drunk more than 100 units in the previous week, whereas other times his weekly amount was 80 units.

The NHS advises men and women not to drink more than 14 units a week - equivalent to six pints of average-strength beer or 10 small glasses of wine.

Chiles said people like him - the ""constant drinkers, the toppers up"" - are ""the problem"".

Although his blood tests were completely normal, a scan showed he had mild to moderate fibrosis of the liver - a type of damage that includes scar tissue forming - and significant liver fat.

The doctor told Chiles: ""You can't carry on like this. You're at risk of disease progression to cirrhosis, liver disease and failure - and death.""

Image caption In his documentary, Chiles is warned by a doctor: ""You can't carry on like this.""

Chiles said it might be easier to ""stop completely"" rather than moderating his drinking, which he said requires planning.

He said: ""I think middle-aged 'supposedly moderate' drinkers need to take a look at ourselves.

""I encourage anyone, don't judge yourself, don't panic you're not going to drop dead, but go on an app like 'Drink Less' and measure what you're drinking, be honest with yourself for three weeks.""

Chiles, who used to present ITV Breakfast show Daybreak until 2011, has also spoken about his struggle with anxiety and depression.

He told the Radio Times that after first leaving the show he was ""self-medicating with alcohol"".

Drinkers Like Us will be broadcast on BBC Two next Monday 27 August at 21:00 BST.

Recovery movement helps addicts kick the habit in Liverpool,"How former addicts in Liverpool are trying a new programme to kick the habit, as figures show deaths from alcohol are on the increase.","['Andy Gill', 'Bbc North West Tonight']",None,"Image caption Addicts on the Recovery programme are hoping to kick the habit for good

""Ah boom chikka boom!"" sings the choir leader. ""Ah boom chikka boom! "" sing back the twenty or so members of the choir.

The Raucous Caucus Recovery Chorus is made up mainly of former drug users and alcoholics from Liverpool.

They rehearse in a small room at an addiction charity office and you have to be sober to sing: all members pledge that they've been off drink or drugs for at least 24 hours.

Being in the choir is part of the treatment for these former users, doing something normal like singing with other people.

But the choir has a wider significance as the public face of a new programme in tackling addiction called Recovery - a movement in which Liverpool is playing a leading role.

Rather than manage an addiction with drug substitutes or controlled drinking, people go through detox and then practise total abstinence.

'Animal existence'

Drink-related deaths in the North West are among the highest with men accounting for two-thirds of such deaths in the UK.

And figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the problem is getting worse.

In the Land of Recovery, it's the guinea pigs that wear the white coats. Mark Gilman , NHS Treatment Agency

More people in the UK died from alcohol-related conditions in 2010 than in 2009 with the figure rising by 126 to 8,790 from 8,664.

But to understand why Liverpool is leading the way in this new idea, we need to go back in time.

In the 1980s, it was one of the cities to bear the brunt of a new drug problem - the arrival of brown powder heroin.

Addicts stole to feed their cravings, and transmitted HIV and other infections by using dirty needles.

To cut crime and improve health, Liverpool was one of the first places to pioneer harm reduction treatments.

Users were prescribed methadone to keep them off heroin. It worked, but many people spent years on methadone, and remained addicts.

Raucous Caucus singer Colin used drugs for 22 years, and was on methadone for 17.

""I'd have done anything for my drugs."" he said. ""I lived an animal existence.""

Now, being in the choir is vital for him.

""I love it,"" he said. ""It's really positive for me.""

Children of addicts

The idea of Recovery, of staying off drink and drugs for good, has been around for some time.

Image caption Former addict Colin has been off drugs for two years thanks to the Recovery programme

It started in America, but is now taking hold in the UK.

Liverpool is still a relatively poor city with high unemployment and poor housing which partly explains why drug and drink addiction is so high; there are twelve Alcoholics Anonymous meetings here every week.

It also explains why Liverpool is at the forefront of the movement in England.

Jacquie Johnston-Lynch, of Action on Addiction, said: ""Liverpool has the highest number of [Recovery] Fellowships per head of population in Europe.""

Liverpool was where the UK's first Recovery March took place in 2009 and Action on Addiction has opened an alcohol-free bar called The Brink.

But the idea of ""Recovery"" has sparked furious debate in drug treatment circles.

Some don't like the idea of users taking more responsibility for their own treatment.

Mark Gilman, leader of the NHS Treatment Agency, said: ""In the Land of Recovery, it's the guinea pigs that wear the white coats.""

But Martin says Recovery is important because it could put an end to the problem where the children of addicts become addicts themselves.

""If you get this right, you're the firewall between the intergenerational transfer of addiction,"" he said.

""It sounds grand, but that's the prize on offer.""","['treatment', 'addicts', 'drugs', 'liverpool', 'habit', 'drug', 'users', 'idea', 'movement', 'kick', 'addiction', 'recovery', 'helps', 'choir', 'boom']","Image caption Addicts on the Recovery programme are hoping to kick the habit for good""Ah boom chikka boom!""

Russia: Government mobile app to help alcoholics,New government app aims to help recovering alcoholics and drug addicts.,"['News Elsewhere...', '...As Found Bbc Monitoring']",None,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Russia has one of the highest alcohol-related mortality rates in the world

The Russian government is trying to tackle the country's notoriously high alcoholism rate with the launch of a free mobile app.

The app will provide information for ""people battling addictions that are very hard to fight"" in order to help them to stay clean, says Yevgeny Bryun, the health ministry's leading narcotics official. He tells the M24 news website that it will offer details of nearby support meetings for recovering alcoholics and drug addicts, medical advice on keeping the problem under control, and access to online radio programmes run by Alcoholics Anonymous.

The app should be up and running next year, but Mr Bryun says other resources are already being made available, including a new radio network for rehabilitation clinics, where ""specialists and alcoholics will talk about recovering"".

Experts are lining up in support of the plan, which they see as a serious attempt to tackle what Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has called Russia's drinking-culture ""national disaster"". ""Information technology can play a very important role here, as you can't change these patients with pills,"" Dr Oleg Zykov, a leading Moscow drugs specialist, tells M24.

Russian men are estimated to drink about 70% more pure alcohol than their American counterparts, and United Nations figures suggest alcohol was the main culprit in 30% of all deaths in Russia in 2012. Government incentives, penalties and price hikes seem to be making little difference. But the ideas keep on coming. In Moscow, a pilot scheme will see the city's health department issue certificates to people who stay clean, and the head of Russia's anti-drugs service has even suggested devoting a television channel to helping people beat their addictions.

The Spiritual Approach To Addiction



Programmes to help drug and alcohol addicts abstain from addictive substances are more effective if they have a 'spiritual component', according to researchers in the United States.



A study of how recovering addicts fared a year after treatment has found that spiritual programmes, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, were more effective than treatment in a hospital clinic. BBC Science reports.



Recovery Programmes

Addiction recovery programmes like Alcoholics Anonymous emphasise a 'spiritual approach' to recovery from addiction.



The Stanford University study found that recovering addicts were more likely to abstain from drugs and alcohol if they were attending a spiritually oriented programme, like Alcoholics Anonymous, than if they were attending a hospital outpatients' clinic.



Spiritual And Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy

Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) was founded in the 1930s, and its 12-step programme encourages members to turn to God or a Higher Power for help in overcoming addiction. Whilst the group does not keep official membership lists, it estimates that there are currently 99,020 groups in operation across the world, with a total membership of 1,995,804.



Clinical treatment, on the other hand, emphasises cognitive skills training and psychotherapy. With a scientific focus, patients rely more heavily on professional counselling services that are likely to deal with teaching people how to deal with situations that may lead to drinking and how to cope with the negativity of alcoholism.



The study found that people attending meetings styled on the AA approach were more likely to be abstaining from drugs or alcohol a year after first seeking help, compared to addicts who were given clinical treatment.



Dr Keith Humphreys, professor of psychiatry at The Stanford University School of Medicine, California, and leader of the research, says spiritual programmes have been widely criticised for not being based on medical science. But, he says, these programmes are just as effective as hospital-based treatment and could in fact be cheaper than conventional medicine.



Support Groups

Whilst Dr Humpreys identified that the costs and length of treatment were comparable, the focus of the study examined the care provided in the year after discharge from inpatient treatment, when costs are very different.



'The study showed that the faith-based approach significantly lowers post-treatment costs by about two-thirds.'

Groups such as AA and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) encourage their members to rely on their support groups, as opposed to doctors, after leaving hospital.



The study suggests that in making connections with other people who have been through similar situations and treatment, individuals are more likely to abstain from drink and drugs and consequently reduce the chances of hospitalisation and costly psychiatric treatment.



Speaking on the cost saving benefits of the spiritually orientated programmes, Dr Humphreys has commented:



'We, as a society, are fortunate to have a developed system of self help organisations that do not cost the taxpayer or the health-care system a dime.'



'Organisations like AA not only reduce human misery, they also take a big burden off of our increasingly resource-strapped health care system. Hence it is important for health care professionals to learn about these organisations and develop connections with them.'

12-Steps To Recovery At the heart of the Alcoholics Anonymous programme are the following 12-steps to recovery:



1 We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable.



2 Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.



3 Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God, as we understood Him.



4 Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.



5 Admitted to God, to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.



6 Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.



7 Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.



8 Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.



9 Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.



10 Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.



11 Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.



12 Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs.

Writer Pete Jackson is a recovering alcoholic and has spent time in Alcoholics Anonymous. It was there he found support from the unlikeliest group of disparate souls - with one common bond. As well as offering the support he needed throughout a difficult time, AA also offered a weekly, sometimes daily, dose of hilarity, upset, heartbreak and friendship.

There are lots of different kinds of AA meetings. Love in Recovery is about meetings where people tell their stories. There are funny stories, sad stories, stories of small victories and milestones, stories of loss, stories of hope, and those stories that you really shouldn't laugh at - but still do, along with the storyteller.

Church rebuilds 1960s singer's life,A 1960s singer songwriter tells an audience in Redruth how his faith helped him to rebuild his life.,[],None,"Image caption John Gaughan worked with many big names in the 1960s but hid his alcoholism for many years

From his early teens John Gaughan decided that he wanted to be a singer/songwriter and aim for the very top in the world of popular music.

By the time he was 19 years old he had achieved that goal.

Mr Gaughan was rubbing shoulders with the most successful writers and publishers of the day.

He was also singing with the top stars of the 1960s, as part of the band Herman's Hermits.

Mr Gaughan said: ""I was working with Billy J Kramer and Gerry Marsden and in America with Peter Noone and the Bee Gees.""

But there was one problem, as he will tell an audience at Redruth's Penventon Park Hotel on Friday 28th October.

""My life had really changed, but the only thing that remained constant was that I was an alcoholic. I had the money, and most of the time the alcohol was free.""

Mr Gaughan said he felt a huge ""emptiness inside that was increasingly being satisfied by alcohol"".

Image caption John Gaughan worked with bands, including the Bee Gees

""On the surface it looked absolutely fantastic. Behind the scenes I had to have a quarter bottle of vodka. I was walking a fine line between not having too much alcohol in my body and having just enough to stop me from shaking on stage.""

Eventually his dependence on alcohol took over and within a few years he was a broken man, ""in body, soul and spirit"".

Mr Gaughan said: ""I thought I could control it. I would give up drinking for a day, apart from the shakes. I went to my doctor and he said I would just have to give up drinking. I tried clinics, I tried hospitals. But nothing seemed to help. The desire was still there.

""Finally I couldn't cope. My marriage failed and my father died. That just left me devastated.""

Mr Gaughan eventually reached a point of total desperation and tried to end it all by throwing himself from the top window of a three storey building.

Life changing moment

He said: ""I thought I had no hope and no future. So I tried to take my own life. But I landed on my feet. I broke all the bones in my feet. Bones in my back were crushed. Yet my spinal chord remained intact.""

During the following months many people called to see him.

Mr Gaughan said: ""I was sat their drinking one night, watching the television, thinking I'm just going to lose everything again. But words came back to me about the time my Grandma told me about God. So I went to church that night. Nobody spoke to me, and I came away disappointed and went back home and sat there drinking.

""That night a man came to see me and said you don't need to be like that, there is a way out. As he was walking passed my flat he said he felt the need to come and knock on my door and tell me about Jesus. He invited me to his church. I went, and that night my life started to change.""

For the past two decades John said he had been given songs by the Lord and his heart's desire was ""to continue to touch people's lives through testimony and song"".

He said his broken bones healed and he has had ""total deliverance from his acute alcoholism"".

Mr Gaughan now travels around the UK singing and sharing his life story.","['alcohol', 'bones', '1960s', 'church', 'john', 'tried', 'night', 'rebuilds', 'singers', 'went', 'drinking', 'came', 'life', 'gaughan']","Image caption John Gaughan worked with many big names in the 1960s but hid his alcoholism for many yearsFrom his early teens John Gaughan decided that he wanted to be a singer/songwriter and aim for the very top in the world of popular music.

Devon SMART Recovery groups for addicts to expand,A group which offers science-based support for addicts plans to expand its service in Devon.,[],None,"Image caption There are 80 SMART recovery groups in the UK and about 650 worldwide

A group which offers science-based support for people with alcohol, drug and gambling addictions plans to expand its service in Devon.

Self Management and Recovery Training (SMART) uses motivational, behavioural and cognitive methods.

The NHS Devon Drug and Alcohol Action Team is spending £4,000 to help it form more groups in the county.

SMART Recovery currently has seven groups and hopes to open a further 10 in the next two years.

The organisation said it gives people alternatives to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA).

'Addictive behaviour'

SMART Recovery uses a four-step plan which helps participants decide whether they have a problem, builds up their motivation to change and offers a set of techniques to support recovery, a spokesperson said.

Richard Phillips, director of SMART Recovery, said: ""We have evidence that all the individual techniques work.

""Clearly AA and NA work very well for some people, for other people SMART Recovery might work better.

""Our approach is very much to place the responsibility of change within the individual, they've got the ability to choose to change their addictive behaviour.""

Kristian Tomblin, from the Devon Drug and Alcohol Action Team, said it was important to have a range of services in place to accommodate different needs.

Mr Phillips said there was 650 groups worldwide with 80 in the UK.

Pakistan battles growing alcohol addiction,"Alcoholism is a growing problem in Pakistan despite it being illegal for the Muslim majority to drink, reports the BBC's Charles Haviland.",[],None,"Image caption Pakistan is supposed to be officially ""dry"" because of its Muslim majority

Alcoholism is a growing problem in Pakistan despite it being illegal for the Muslim majority to drink. The BBC's Charles Haviland finds lives ruined and clinics and therapy groups trying to overcome a taboo subject.

Late one night, the beat of dance music drifts down from an upper storey of an apartment block on the edge of a Pakistani city.

Inside the flat, the music is pulsating around a dance floor. There is a bar where a range of liquor is being served and cocktails shaken. Under flashing stroboscopic lights, dozens of people laugh, dance and enjoy the drink.

This is one of the parties that are now commonplace in the cities but are highly discreet.

The liquor is bought illicitly from bootleggers - or from the regular alcohol shops that are supposed to sell only to minorities holding permits but also sell illegally to large numbers of Muslims.

Pakistan even has its own breweries which officially produce only for non-Muslims - or for export.

'Increasing trend'

Image caption Mr Ahmed was formerly an alcoholic and now runs a rehabilitation organisation

The subculture of liquor enjoyment belies Pakistan's status as officially ""dry"". That is, the 96% of Pakistanis who, according to official figures are Muslim, are not supposed to drink.

The penalty if they do so is 80 lashes but it is not strictly enforced.

Although there are many harmless social gatherings, there is also a growing problem of addiction to the bottle.

Officials have told the BBC - while not wanting to be quoted - that alcohol-related diseases have risen by at least 10% in the past five years.

Tahir Ahmed, a former alcoholic who now runs a rehabilitation organisation, Therapy Works, detects ""a visibly increasing trend"". Six years ago, when he started this work, most drinkers were in at least their 20s; now, some are as young as 14, he says.

I would wake up and I would not remember the last two or three days of my life because I was so intoxicated - and that really frightened me Sara, Alcoholic in Lahore

Sometimes alcohol is taken in conjunction with narcotics.

He says alcohol has a much firmer presence in the home - especially for the affluent - and at social occasions like weddings.

And he says that if a Pakistani drinks, it is usually in large quantities because it is, he believes, a response to the massive social pressures here, including the threat of political violence and high unemployment.

""Unfortunately drinking in Pakistan is not recreational,"" he said. ""It's much more escapist and much more relief-seeking. That means drink till the bottle is emptied.""

Now 65, this is the way he himself used to be. He watched two of his friends die of cirrhosis of the liver and nearly died himself.

He decided to stop drinking but went into clinical depression for a year. Only then did he receive therapy, later setting up his organisation, which is registered with Britain's Counselling and Psychotherapy Central Awarding Body.

'Taboo for women'

Drinking among the affluent is especially noticeable. Some senior politicians are rumoured to drink, and alcohol is served at some high-society events, though never on camera.

But it affects everybody. Last month, at least 12 people in Karachi died after drinking toxic home-made liquor.

Some Pakistani alcoholics are women. For them, the stigma is all the greater.

In Pakistan's second city, Lahore, Sara - whose name we have changed - recounts her story.

Five years ago, aged 33 and with two teenage children, she got divorced. Then alcoholism just sucked her in. She would go binge-drinking for days at a time and suffer blackouts.

""I would wake up and I would not remember the last two or three days of my life because I was so intoxicated. And that really frightened me.""

Image caption Mr Umer said a strict and austere regimen helped him overcome drinking

As word got around and she became an embarrassment to her children, Sara wanted to go to a rehabilitation clinic. But being a woman made this very difficult in Pakistan.

""Some men will turn around and say, 'Okay, I have a problem.' But it's a taboo for women. A woman will never stand up and say I have a problem and I need help. That's not acceptable.""

Nine months ago, she finally sought assistance and was able to get medicine and therapy-based help at home, from Therapy Works. Now she is recovering.

In an unregulated medical market, there are other clinics whose approach to treatment is much more strict. The BBC visited one in Karachi, called Willing Ways, where a group of current and former residents were in a session with the doctor who founded the establishment.

Clients are admitted with their families' consent, but they do not always realise they will be confined for three months. While living there, they are deprived of all addictive substances including tobacco, and of all external communications.

One former patient contacted the BBC and said he felt the set-up was excessively draconian.

But a satisfied former client, businessman Yousuf Umer, says the austere regimen worked for him.

""It has changed my life and I am a very successful man now.""

'I'm listening'

Image caption Dr Mamsa, right, conducts a radio show using a mix of English and Urdu

While clinics and therapy-based groups tackle alcoholism, the media is now doing so too.

On Karachi's Radio 1 91 FM a psychiatrist-broadcaster, Dr Faisal Mamsa, takes calls every Thursday and Friday night on all sorts of social taboos - including this one.

""Go ahead. I'm listening,"" he tells callers in soft tones. Sporting a mop of unruly hair and a beard, he wears shorts in the studio.

There follows a conversation in a mix of English and Urdu.

Calls or texts from affected family members are encouraged. A woman says her husband has been drinking for 13 years but she cannot persuade him to seek help. The doctor suggests they contact Alcoholics Anonymous.

The next caller is an addict who admits he is violent.

Dr Mamsa says the anonymity of radio makes it ideal for this subject.

""I'm not concerned about the name,"" he said.

""If they're talking about a problem, it's not just them who's benefiting out of it but whosoever is listening to the radio is listening about it. What matters is that the problem is being discussed.""

There is no chance of Pakistan's legally ""dry"" status changing in the near future. Yet there is an alcoholism problem, which officials and doctors say is growing.

Serial drink-driver avoids jail 'for being a woman',,[],2019-04-12 18:51:44+00:00,"Image copyright Paul Beard Image caption If Victoria Parry had been a man ""it would have been straight down the stairs"" to prison, a judge said

A judge gave a serial drink-driver a chance to avoid jail because she is a woman.

Victoria Parry, 30, hit three other cars after downing a bottle of wine.

Judge Sarah Buckingham said Parry, an alcoholic who had escaped an abusive relationship, would have gone ""straight down the stairs"" to jail if she were a man.

Although Parry ""deserved"" a prison term, the judge gave her three months to address her issues.

The comments are being investigated by a judicial watchdog.

Prosecutor Tim Sapwell said Parry caught a van's rear bumper, a Vauxhall Insignia's wing mirror, then the side of a BMW ""very heavily"" in the crash.

'Shocking case'

He told Warwick Crown Court it caused her Fiat to spin off the A46 near Stratford-upon-Avon into a wooded area where it caught fire.

An off-duty police officer pulled her from the car, and Parry, who was banned from the road at the time, told him she had drunk a bottle of wine and ""shouldn't be driving"", Mr Sapwell said.

She was arrested, and registered a reading of almost three times the legal limit at a police station.

Lucy Tapper, defending, said Parry had a ""considerable drink problem"" after a 15-year abusive relationship, but had begun to tackle her alcohol intake.

The judge said: ""If Miss Parry was a man, there is no question it would have been straight down the stairs, because this is a shocking case of dangerous driving against a background of two previous convictions for excess alcohol.""

But, she said, the offence had been committed in May 2018, and Parry, who had admitted dangerous driving, had not been in trouble since.

""She has clearly got an alcohol problem. She is, whether she admits it or not, an alcoholic,"" the judge said.

Deferring sentencing for three months, judge Buckingham told Parry she ""richly deserved"" an immediate custodial term of 18 months.

""I want to see whether you can really address the issues rather than paying lip service,"" she said.

She ordered Parry to abstain from alcohol, attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and pay for private counselling.

If Parry complied, she said, the custody would not be made immediate.

"Love in Recovery, Series 3, Ivy",Award-nominated comedy drama by Pete Jackson set in Alcoholics Anonymous.,[],None,"Third series of the award-nominated comedy drama set in Alcoholics Anonymous. Written by Pete Jackson and inspired by his own road to recovery. Stars Rebecca Front, John Hannah, Sue Johnston, Paul Kaye and Johnny Vegas.

Love in Recovery follows the lives of five very different recovering alcoholics. Johnny Vegas is Andy, the sweet but simple self-appointed group leader. Sue Johnston plays straight talking Julie, who's been known to have the odd relapse here and there - and everywhere. Rebecca Front is the snobby and spiky Fiona, an ex-banker who had it all and then lost the lot. John Hannah is Simon, a snide journalist who’s not an alcoholic – he got caught drink driving, his boss made him attend the meeting, but he fell in love with Fiona and stayed. And, despite her best efforts, she fell in love with him too. Paul Kaye is Danno, a down and out two-bit chancer with a shady past but a lot of heart, who’s desperate to turn his life around.

As we follow their weekly meetings, we hear them moan, argue, laugh, fall apart, fall in love and, most importantly, tell their stories.

In episode four, Oscar has dropped in to the meeting on the way to see his son. Oscar’s recently lost his wife and wants to share her story. But Oscar’s tale is far from what any of the group expected.

Writer Pete Jackson is a recovering alcoholic and has spent time in Alcoholics Anonymous. It was there he found, as most people do, support from the unlikeliest group of disparate souls, all banded together due to one common bond. As well as offering the support he needed throughout a difficult time, AA also offered a weekly, sometimes daily, dose of hilarity, upset, heartbreak and friendship.

Love in Recovery doesn’t seek to represent an AA meeting exactly as it might happen in real life, but to capture the funny stories, the sad stories, the stories of small victories and of huge milestones, stories of loss, stories of hope, and most importantly, the many highs and lows in the journey of recovery.

"'So drunk my daughter, 12, made my meals'",,"['Annabel Rackham', 'Bbc News']",2016-11-17 11:44:15+00:00,"Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Women's alcohol consumption is catching up with men

""My daughter told me she didn't like the fact that I always smelt of wine. That was probably the point I thought I may have a problem.""

What started as a few glasses of wine in the evening with her husband quickly developed into full-blown alcoholism for Alice, a mother of one from Birmingham.

She's one of a growing number of women dealing with a drink problem, with recent statistics showing women are nearing equality with men in alcohol consumption.

But as the shame of her addiction eventually forced her to seek help, she found several barriers in her way as a woman and mother seeking treatment.

Her problems with alcohol started at the age of 33 when she married and had a child.

""My then husband used to like popping to the local for one or two drinks before bed. Once our child was born this led onto opening a bottle of wine each evening and this is when the pattern started.

""Over the years it went from sharing one bottle to sharing two-plus. Then it moved to having a drink as soon as I got home from work about 4pm.""

Need help or support?

Need help or support?

Her marriage eventually broke down, and Alice sought more comfort from the bottle.

Alcohol was no longer a treat in the home, but became part of her daily routine, regularly drinking alone. She didn't see as dangerous at the time.

""We hear horror stories of binge drinking but not about the middle class consumption of wine or a gin and tonic in the evening.

""When I grew up men went out to the pub and drank, women less so because alcohol was not generally available in the home except for special occasions. Things have equalised.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alice said Alcoholics Anonymous meetings were too 'male dominated'

Alice was signed off work with depression whilst dealing with her divorce, and after a day of drinking would often be inebriated by the time her daughter came home from school.

Her daughter often had to do the household chores she was unable to complete. ""She made tea on a number of occasions,"" recalls Alice.

""I had taken an 'overdose' on a couple of occasions - never serious attempts just feeling drunk and wretched. My daughter was about 12 at the time and she was becoming increasingly fearful about how much I was drinking.""

This, combined with GP blood tests, made her realise how much damage she was doing to herself and those around her.

Alice initially tried to seek help at AA meetings, but struggled with their 'male dominated' environment and could never find childcare for her daughter.

""There needs to be women only groups and support groups to help with childcare so they can attend appointments and meetings.""

""I think that women, especially single women, have more of an issue because they fear social service involvement and losing their children"".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alcohol related problems are increasing amongst women

After finding AA unsuccessful, she was referred to a support worker from the charity Change, Grow, Live who helped her with recovery on an individual basis near her home in Birmingham. They helped Alice set goals to help her see beyond drinking.

""One of the goals I set in early recovery was to join a choir, which I am still enjoying. I have now had a whole raft of excellent experiences.""

Knowing the risks

Defeating alcoholism also made Alice find some compromises in her life, which involved stepping back from career aspirations to focus on her family.

""I don't need to overdo it by working full-time. I spend more, and less stressful, time with the kids.""

The theme of Alcohol Awareness Week 2016 , which ends on 20 November, is ""knowing the risks"" - getting people thinking about why they drink, and ""how it affects us as individuals, families, communities and society as a whole.""

Sian Warmer, head of services at CGL, the charity that helped Alice, says they help people identify why they are turning to drink.

""The reasons people use substances, whether they are drugs or alcohol, are endless and often very unique to the individual.

""We recognise that these people may have complex needs, involving things such as domestic violence, pregnancy, mental health and sex work.""","['meals', 'alcohol', 'women', 'alice', 'wine', 'image', 'work', 'helped', 'daughter', '12', 'occasions', 'help', 'drunk']","Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Women's alcohol consumption is catching up with men""My daughter told me she didn't like the fact that I always smelt of wine.

The unspoken alcohol problem among UK Punjabis,Alcohol consumption is glamorised across different aspects of Punjabi culture and shame stops many seeking the help that they need.,"['Anusha Kumar', 'Aidan Castelli', 'Chayya Syal', 'Bbc Digital Pilots']",None,"Image copyright Vik Kainth

For many British Punjabis, alcohol abuse is an open secret. Alcohol consumption is glamorised across different aspects of Punjabi culture and shame stops many seeking the help that they need.

Harjinder read her daughter Jaspreet one last bedtime story, then kissed her goodnight. She was exhausted after a long day, and drifted off next to her daughter. Her toddler son was already asleep in the next room.

The next thing she remembers is her husband yelling. He was drunk and furious that when he returned from the pub she wasn't in their marital bed. In a rage, he flipped the child's bed throwing his wife and daughter to the floor. Harjinder hit the radiator hard with Jaspreet landing on top of her.

Incidents like this were a regular feature of Jaspreet and her brother Hardeep's childhood. ""It was heartbreaking,"" Jaspreet says.

So when Harjinder found Hardeep, now aged 16, drinking whisky in his room after an argument with his alcoholic dad, she was terrified that he was following in his father's footsteps.

There are around 430,000 Sikhs in the UK, making up a significant proportion of the British Punjabi population. Harjinder herself is Sikh and amongst her community her experience isn't unique.

A new survey, commissioned by the BBC to investigate attitudes to alcohol among British Sikhs, found that - although drinking alcohol is forbidden in Sikhism - 27% of British Sikhs report having someone in their family with an alcohol problem. It's a problem which is rarely talked about openly in the community.

More than 1,000 British Sikhs responded to the survey - find out more using this interactive tool:

Harjinder moved in with her husband's family after their arranged marriage - both common practices within Punjabi and wider South Asian communities. She was shocked to find out how much her newly acquired family's social life centred around the men's excessive drinking.

The family, along with young children, would go to a friend's house and would stay there until two or three o'clock in the morning waiting for the men, and she started to feel increasingly isolated.

Rav Sekhon, a British Punjabi psychotherapist who works with ethnic minority communities, says: ""There is really strong pride and honour for the family name. They don't want anyone to perceive them as having something wrong with them or any form of weakness.""

Sanjay Bhandari is from a Hindu Punjabi family, a partner at a multinational city firm in London and a recovering alcoholic. After his father died when he was 15, he says he started drinking and never really stopped.

By his mid 30s, he realised that he hadn't been a single day without a drink for over seven years, and he'd been dependent on alcohol for much longer. He says his Punjabi background played a big part in discouraging him from admitting he had a problem.

Sanjay, who has been sober for 16 years, says he didn't feel that he could admit he had a weakness, nor that he was feeling lonely and self-medicating with alcohol. He didn't look to the Punjabi community for help, but eventually found Alcoholics Anonymous.

""It would never have occurred to me to go to the community for help with drinking. It was almost the last place I would have gone.""

When the first immigrants, who were mostly men, came to the UK from Punjab in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, many found themselves struggling to assimilate being in a new country, often working long hours to send money home to their families.

The stresses of moving to a new culture, the associated language barriers and the racism they faced meant many of these men turned to alcohol to cope. This reliance on alcohol has had generational repercussions.

Jennifer Shergill, an alcohol practitioner from the West Midlands, works with Sikh men and women to manage and overcome addiction. She points to the combination of British binge drinking and the culture of drinking in Punjab, which together create a perfect storm for some of the people accessing support services.

For Harjinder, her husband's heavy drinking had worsening consequences. Although he was becoming increasingly violent towards her, she was still reluctant to seek help.

She says his behaviour was normalised by his family, leaving her feeling almost brainwashed by them into hopelessly accepting the situation. It wasn't until she went to her GP with injuries from the abuse that she realised that what she was experiencing wasn't normal.

Eventually Harjinder called the police and she and her children moved out of the family home to stay with her parents. Even then her husband didn't acknowledge the impact that his drinking was having.

""I think [my husband] knew deep down that what he was doing was wrong but it was almost as if his male pride couldn't admit it.""

Image copyright Vik Kainth

Jennifer Shergill thinks one of the barriers for people seeking help is the fear of someone finding out. ""There is stigma associated with chronic alcohol misuse and they don't want their reputation to be tainted... if there is a dependent drinker in the family what might people think of our family?""

The Shanti Project, where Jennifer works, is just one scheme working to tackle this stigma and to provide culturally appropriate services for the Punjabi community in Birmingham.

Others include a volunteer-led Sikh Helpline, the Derby Recovery Network, BAC-IN, and First Step Foundation, which are all doing their part to help tackle alcoholism in a culturally sensitive way.

The Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute Harjinder's husband due to a lack of evidence and, six weeks later, Harjinder and her children returned to the home she shared with her husband.

Her husband's family had visited her to assure her he had stopped drinking and things would be different - so feeling the pressure from both his family and her own, she and her children returned home.

But Harjinder struggled with depression. Her husband hadn't stopped drinking. It was at this point that - prompted by a community psychiatric nurse - she started talking to a counsellor. ""I felt quite desperate at times,"" she says, ""but the counselling really helped, I felt that I could carry on.""

Harjinder is still living with her husband after more than 20 years of marriage, but their lives are very separate now. Her daughter, now in her 20s, constantly urges her to leave him.

""I've thought about it a lot. A part of me thinks, why bother at this age? But then another part of me thinks: well, if I've got another 20 years of this, that's not good. I think it could happen.""

Harjinder and her family members' names have been changed.

AA: America's Gift to the World,,[],2015-04-01 13:36:32+00:00,"AL Kennedy's new Radio 4 documentary - America's Gift to the World - tells the story of Alcoholics Anonymous and its methods, and asks whether AA is still the best 'cure' for addicts given new science and treatments. This is the background to the story, and how the making of the programme impacted on its presenter.

The initials AA are peripherally familiar to many, as is perhaps the name Alcoholics Anonymous. Nevertheless, I think a lot of people don’t know much about AA or the story of its creation – when Bill Wilson, an alcoholic wall street trader with a big idea about staying sober, met an alcoholic doctor, Bob Smith. They talked and understood each other, helped each other get sober and worked out a way they could pass that on. I’ve seen friends ruin their own lives and those of all around them through dysfunctional drinking: the idea of two people finding a way to unravel that nightmare is truly beautiful and fascinating.

AA’s desire to preserve its members' privacy and to make no grand statements on issues, meant we had to be sensitive about interviews. It’s also probably one reason why AA isn’t well-known outside its membership. AA’s also an intentionally disorganised organisation. I loved looking at a huge association which seems to do exactly what it intends and yet which is specifically engineered to concentrate power and responsibility downwards and to avoid creating authority figures, funding drives, advertising drives and so forth. It seems to reverse modern thinking about success, but has millions of members, has lasted 80 years and still rolls on.

With so many products and experiences now designed to exert an addictive or pseudo-addictive influence, I suppose AA pushes against some powerful trends in society. As was pointed out during my research, alcohol use is central to many of our social occasions, celebrations, even some religious ceremonies. Anyone trying to stay away from drink isn’t going to have it easy. AA isn’t for everyone, but it seems to work very well for those who do use it.

What I was struck by most of all was the generosity, honesty and compassion of all our contributors. We have hours of wonderful stories and insights that we just couldn’t fit into the programme. The professionals we spoke to were genuinely passionate about trying to understand alcoholism and help alcoholics to recover. AA members were searingly frank about themselves – and very funny - and really had a grip on who they were and how they could meet the world. We also interviewed Al-Anon and Alateen members – those affected by the drinking of others. Their experiences and bravery were startling, humbling. It was really a privilege to meet them all.

Alcohol dependency: When social drinking becomes a problem,"Alcohol-related health issues among baby boomers are on the rise. Daily drinking can start off as a social event, but turn into dependency and addiction, experts say.","['Melissa Hogenboom', 'Bbc News']",None,"Alcohol-related health issues among baby boomers are on the rise. Daily drinking can start off as a social event but turn into dependency, addiction experts say. So when does social drinking become alcoholism?

In the festive season, with office parties, Christmas, and new year, there is opportunity aplenty for yet another tipple.

Since the 1950s, alcohol consumption in the UK has gradually increased. The NHS now spends more on alcohol-related illness among baby boomers than any other age group, with £825m spent on 55 to 74-year-olds in 2010-11 compared to £64m on under-24s.

Alcohol addiction When someone becomes dependent or addicted to alcohol, they: Develop a strong sense of compulsion to drink

May drink shortly after waking to reduce feelings of alcohol withdrawal

Develop a reduced capacity to control how often and how much they drink

Organise their lifestyle around drinking

Continue to drink despite physical or social problems Source: BBC Health The long-term effects of alcohol

Estimates also suggest about nine per cent of men and three per cent of women in the UK show signs of alcohol dependence.

But it is the functioning alcoholic that can slip under the radar - before their health issues are severe enough to need treatment.

Straight vodka

Dr John Marsden, an alcohol and drug dependency expert from King's College London, says a typical functioning alcoholic can manage to hold down a job despite having a ""very severe drinking problem that they have been incubating over a very long period"".

""Alcohol problems are difficult to understand because they do not occur overnight. They are hidden from view which makes functioning alcoholics a group we cannot easily help.""

Rob C, who is 61, was one of them. At his worst he was drinking 1.5 litres of straight vodka per day.

""Then I began to suffer blackouts, losing whole days and not remembering anything.""

He would be first to arrive at work, which made him able to set out his ""drinks for the day with what looked like a bottle of mineral water"".

""I would hide bottles around the office. You think nobody else knows, that it doesn't smell, that you're getting away with it. But of course they did notice.""

Life saver

For several years, maintaining a full-time finance job, he drank increasingly more during the day.

There was work, there was money and increasingly the motivation to alter ones mood quickly. Alcohol has been the drug of choice to do that Dr John Marsden, Addiction expert

What started as a social pastime nearly cost him his relationship. Now sober for eight years, looking back he says that even if a colleague had said something at the time, he would not have listened.

""I resented the changes at work and told myself I deserved a drink. I would buy wine at lunchtime and drink it from a polystyrene cup.""

Wine turned to vodka for a ""bigger kick"" and lunchtime turned to morning through to night.

Early retirement on medical grounds made his addiction worse. It was only when his partner threatened to kick him out that he sought help with Alcoholics Anonymous, who he says saved his life.

Rob is not alone. In the last decade there has been a 63% increase in prescriptions for the treatment of alcohol dependency in England, as well as a 20% rise in deaths from liver disease.

Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, a liver specialist and chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance, believes the number of people dying from liver disease will keep rising.

The majority of people who have alcohol-related health problems are middle-aged, which Sir Ian says is a consequence of chronic alcohol misuse - many years of frequent heavy drinking, rather than binge drinking - a session of drinking large amounts of alcohol in a small space of time.

But he says that though there is a big overlap, it is important to remember not all heavy social drinkers are dependent on alcohol.

""Some people can control their drinking after work, others can't. If people are frequently drinking harmful levels of alcohol - over 50 units a week for men, 35 for women - most will end up suffering some form of physical, mental or social harm.""

A lifetime's worth of drinking is catching up with baby boomers, says Emily Robinson from the Alcohol Concern.

The charity hopes that their campaign, Dry January, will help get people thinking about how much they drink, especially at home when units are harder to measure, and crucially, before they reach a stage where drinking is affecting their health.

""The issue of people drinking every day is worrying as it's a way of slipping into dependency, as you need to drink a little more each time to feel the same effects,"" she says.

Dr Marsden suggests the line between social drinking and dependency is clear. He says the first question that needs to be asked by clinicians or family members is: ""Has anyone expressed concern to you about your drinking?""

What's a unit? Half a pint of standard strength (4%) beer, cider or lager

A single pub measure of spirit (25ml)

Half a standard glass of wine (175ml) Alcohol units guide

This question assesses whether a person's behaviour has negatively impacted on someone close to them, he adds.

""If your alcohol consumption has caused a problem for someone else - I'm not rushing to label you an alcoholic but suggesting you need to take a closer look at your behaviour.""

There is a clear reason the baby boomer generation is now most at risk from alcohol-related problems, argues Dr Marsden.

A hard-working generation led to an appetite for entertainment and relaxation.

""There was work, there was money and increasingly the motivation to alter one's mood quickly. Alcohol has been the drug of choice to do that.""","['alcohol', 'baby', 'problem', 'dependency', 'drink', 'work', 'drinking', 'social', 'health', 'alcoholrelated', 'problems']","Daily drinking can start off as a social event but turn into dependency, addiction experts say.
So when does social drinking become alcoholism?
""Alcohol problems are difficult to understand because they do not occur overnight.
In the last decade there has been a 63% increase in prescriptions for the treatment of alcohol dependency in England, as well as a 20% rise in deaths from liver disease.

Concerns are growing for former England footballer Paul Gascoigne who has been struggling with an addiction to alcohol.

The 45-year-old was shaking and slurred his words on stage at a charity event in Northampton on Thursday and his agent, Terry Baker, says he now fears for Gascoigne's life.

Alex Best, widow of football legend and recovering alcoholic George Best who died in 2005, is also concerned.

She told The Sun newspaper: ""Seeing Gazza in such a bad way brings back the most horrible memories of George when he was in the grip of the drink that eventually killed him.

""It's heartbreaking to see Paul so deeply gripped by his addiction again.""

Relapse can be part of recovery. That's when they really learn to move on. I've worked with people who have relapsed 20 or 30 times and have got there in the end Julie Rogers, Substance misuse manager

Dependency

NHS figures suggest nine in every 100 men and four in every 100 women show signs of alcohol dependence.

Drinking alcohol becomes a focus in daily life, meaning the person no longer has control over their drinking and depends on it to get through the day.

You don't necessarily have to be rolling around drunk to have a dependency on alcohol - people may be able to hold down a career and drink in a way that is damaging.

Dependency mean you are physically and psychologically tied to booze - you feel compelled to drink and this takes its toll on your physical and emotional health.

Julie Rogers has been working in the addiction field for 12 years, helping people who are hooked on alcohol.

Ms Rogers, who works with the charity Foundation 66, says problem drinking is a complex and incredibly difficult behaviour to break. No two people are the same and there is no single approach that is guaranteed to work.

""Alcohol addiction does not have any boundaries. It affects all types of people alike. It doesn't matter if you are wealthy or poor.

Warning signs of alcohol dependence Worrying about where your next drink is coming from and planning social, family and work events around alcohol

Finding you have a compulsive need to drink and finding it hard to stop once you start

Waking up and drinking - or feeling the need to have a drink in the morning

Suffering from withdrawal symptoms, such as sweating, shaking and nausea, which stop once you drink alcohol

""And there are so many different reasons why people drink. But the thing they do have in common is that, for them, alcohol has become more than just a drink.

""It becomes something that you need to do to cope and get through. That's when it becomes a problem.""

For some, the trigger is stress or anxiety - a demanding job or a traumatic divorce, for example.

She said for others it is a learned behaviour - something they have been exposed to during their childhood and have grown up to follow the same path.

Genetics can also make some people susceptible, experts suspect.

Breaking the cycle

Regardless of the cause, the first step to tackling addiction is the same.

Ms Rogers said: ""Recognising you have a problem and then seeking help is the first step.

""It sounds simple but, in reality it's not. It can be hard to admit you have a problem and actually do something about it.""

The former Newcastle, Tottenham and Lazio player has tried hard to fight his addiction, spending repeated spells in rehab over the last decade.

Alcohol harms Short term health risks include alcohol poisoning and accidents and injuries

Long term health consequences include an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, liver disease (which can cause jaundice), pancreatitis and certain cancers

Drinking too much can also affect your relationships and your ability to hold down a job

It can lead to anxiety, depression and suicidal feelings

Gazza's drinking problems started during his playing days.

In 1998, shortly after his divorce from wife Sheryl, he was admitted to the The Priory Hospital in Marchwood, near Southampton, to receive treatment for stress and drink problems.

In 2001, whilst playing at Everton, Gascoigne admitted himself to an alcohol rehabilitation clinic in Arizona on the insistence of his then manager Walter Smith.

Four years after retiring, in 2008, he was arrested in Newcastle and detained under the Mental Health Act and was later sectioned following reports that he was acting strangely in Hemel Hempstead.

More recently he has been treated at The Priory again and the Providence Projects treatment centre in Bournemouth.

Ms Rogers says relapses are incredibly common, and they shouldn't be seen as a failure.

""It's important that we do not judge relapse because that just compounds the shame and guilt people feel about it.

Dennis' story I took my first drink in my early teens. There were consequences from my drinking from the beginning, very small at first: arguing with friends, turning up late for social appointments, losing keys, urinating in alleyways, and general behaviours I would not engage in when I wasn't drinking. As I reached my 20s I had destroyed a marriage by now, and I was well on that alcoholic slippery downhill slope. I was starting to lose jobs as I could not be trusted to turn up for work. Into my 30s, my drinking very subtly but progressively got worse; the dry spells between my binges got shorter and shorter. I had started too waken up in strange places and also in A&E hospitals and couldn't remember how I got there. The last 10 years of my drinking, I had tried many avenues of escape in order to stop drinking completely and failed every single time. At 40 years old I was truly beaten by alcohol. I had heard and of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and had visited AA meetings in the past but nothing else, I would visit and then leave and eventually always drink again. I did not know what it was to be an alcoholic, and I had not fully admitted to myself that I was an alcoholic. Now, through AA's 12-step recovery programme, I have a productive, contented life with complete abstinence from alcohol.

""Relapse can be part of recovery. That's when they really learn to move on. I've worked with people who have relapsed 20 or 30 times and have got there in the end.

""Even if it is your thousandth relapse, it can still be the last. It's important not to give up.""

She said in order to break the cycle some people need to hit a critical point where it's ""stop drinking or die"".

Help on hand

But for others, abstinence is never an option.

Instead, they might work towards curbing their intake, even if it means they are still drinking far too much for good health.

""Some people reduce the harm rather than stop drinking.

""Some relapse every few months but still lead a fulfilling life. Even if you get a month of sobriety at least it's a month.""

She said there is plenty of help available to anyone struggling to keep their drinking under control.

""Your first port of call should be your GP who can direct you to your local alcohol services.""

Support may include home-based and community detoxification programmes, counselling and group work.

Friends and family also have a role to play.

Friend and former England player Alan Shearer has said: ""It won't be easy, but he [Gazza] needs to dig deep and find the energy and the will to do it.

""What he needs to know most of all is that he is loved.""","['rogers', 'alcohol', 'thats', 'stop', 'need', 'drink', 'work', 'addiction', 'drinking', 'alcoholic', 'grip', 'living']","Drinking alcohol becomes a focus in daily life, meaning the person no longer has control over their drinking and depends on it to get through the day.

Football star Paul Gascoigne has revealed he thought he was going to die during his most recent spell in rehab.

The former England midfielder has flown back to the UK after more than a month at a clinic in Phoenix, Arizona, that specialises in treating alcoholism.

The 45-year-old told the Sun newspaper that he heard three doctors conclude he was going to pass away, before he slipped into a three-day coma.

His life was saved, but Gascoigne said: ""I thought I was on my way out.""

Fresh fears for the health of Gascoigne, who has battled against alcoholism for several years, emerged at a public appearance in Northampton in January.

'Total wreck'

Within days, he had been flown to the private clinic in the US and Gascoigne - nicknamed Gazza - said he begged its doctors at the clinic to save his life as he went through the detox process.

""Three doctors didn't think I would make it,"" he said.

""It has got to inspire me to never let this happen again. I've come through that - death. I was dead.""

He added: ""I thought I was on my way out. I looked like a corpse. I was a total wreck.""

Gascoigne, whose football clubs included Newcastle United, Tottenham, Lazio, Rangers and Everton, has had a long-term battle against alcohol addiction.

He said his latest problems started in Dubai last summer when he started drinking alcohol again after 17 months ""dry"". The ex-footballer said he followed that by staying off alcohol for the following six months, but his own despair at his lapse meant that he failed to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and isolated himself, barely eating. ""I was living like a dry drunk,"" he said.

Eventually, he succumbed and started drinking heavily again, a situation which came to public attention at the Northampton charity event when he broke down sobbing on stage.

On his admission to the US treatment centre, Gascoigne's management company said he was alcoholic with ""complex issues"" which were being dealt with by professionals.

It has since emerged that the public appearance could still raise thousands of pounds for charity.

Gascoigne said he had no recollection of being there.

'Another chance'

Gascoigne's drinking problems started during his playing days - he was admitted to the Priory Hospital, near Southampton, in 1998, shortly after his divorce from wife Sheryl.

Three years later, while playing at Everton, Gascoigne admitted himself to an alcohol rehabilitation clinic in Arizona on the insistence of his then manager Walter Smith.

In 2008, four years after retiring, he was arrested in Newcastle and detained under the Mental Health Act.

He was later sectioned following reports that he was acting strangely in Hemel Hempstead.

More recently he has been treated at The Priory again and at the Providence Projects treatment centre in Bournemouth.

Gascoigne told the Sun that the way forward for him now was to start attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings again.

""Meetings are really important. I was too weak, I stopped going to them. I have to start going.

""I should be dead. The doctors said I would not make it. But I'm here, I have another chance - and I'm going to take it.""","['alcohol', 'drama', 'problems', 'started', 'doctors', 'thought', 'public', 'gascoigne', 'way', 'rehab', 'going', 'paul', 'gazza', 'clinic', 'reveals']","Image caption Concerns for Gascoigne's wellbeing were raised again earlier this yearFootball star Paul Gascoigne has revealed he thought he was going to die during his most recent spell in rehab.

People recovering from drug and alcohol addiction in Gwynedd and Anglesey have been boosted by a new charity which offers support day and night.

The Anglesey and Gwynedd Recovery Organisation (AGRO) uses activities like gardening and group sessions to support people in their bid to give up drink and drugs.

More than 70 people have already approached AGRO's Holyhead and Bangor groups for help since it was set up last September, just through word of mouth recommendation.

Its founders are now starting to publicise their work and have secured funding from the Safer Anglesey and Gwynedd partnerships to set up groups in Amlwch, Llangefni and Caernarfon.

Huw Harries, who is a support worker for the dug and alcohol rehabilitation organisation CAIS by day, co-founded the charity in his spare time using his own funds.

Image caption AGRO hope to soon launch groups in Amlwch, Llangefni and Caernarfon

As a former alcoholic himself, Huw feels able to reach out to those who are also fighting to get sober.

He said: ""I haven't had a drink in 15 years. I used to be a nightclub manager and I suppose I'm on the other side of the fence now.

""I gave up because my wife gave me an ultimatum, saying she'd go back to Scotland if I didn't. I'm so glad I did because she died of cancer two years later and I was able to nurse her with a clear head.""

But after working for CAIS for eight years, Huw realised that those in need had nowhere to turn to in the evenings or weekends.

Now AGRO offer 24-hour phone support to help an addict avoid having another drink or talk them through a period of anxiety.

But AGRO's other aim is to help people to recover through getting involved in new activities.

They have already turned a piece of Holyhead waste ground into a productive vegetable garden and have future plans to acquire more allotments and open a shop to sell their produce. They will plough any profit back into the community.

They also organise walks, kayaking sessions and fishing at weekends to help people get active and have something else to think about.

""It gives people something else to do when they come out of rehab after three or six months,"" explained Huw.

""And people really want to do it. It isn't often you have alcohol and drug addicts working on something together.""

He was spurred on to start the groups on Anglesey after figures suggested more people from the island were admitted into Bangor's Ysbyty Gwynedd with alcohol-related problems than from anywhere in Gwynedd.

But from small beginnings, he see big demand for AGRO's work.

""We have all sorts of members,"" said Huw. ""Students, people who own their own businesses, housewives, unemployed people.

""The days of people drinking all day haven't completely gone, but mostly now people binge-drink when they get stressed, or have a glass or two, or a bottle every night.

""And the price of alcohol doesn't matter. If you want a drink you'll get it, even if there are no buses and you have to walk a long way.

""It's easier to get some alcohol than call a doctor for help at night.""

Although Huw is happy to help those who want to recover, he thinks that educating those who are yet to find themselves in trouble is ultimately the way forward.

""We want to go into schools or go to the WI to educate people about the side-effects of alcohol,"" he said.

""If you catch people early enough, then you'll avoid spending money on A&E or on unemployment, divorce or sorting out the effect on the kids.""

""I've seen the suffering it can cause and want to help people early on.""

Demi Lovato thanks fans as she marks five years sober,"Exclusive music news, big interviews, entertainment, social media trends and video from the news people at BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra.",[],None,"Demi Lovato has thanked her fans as she marks five years without an alcoholic drink.

The singer posted a heartfelt Instagram message alongside a progress tracker from the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous.

""So grateful. It's been quite the journey. So many ups and downs,"" she wrote.

The 24-year-old has been open about her struggles with substance abuse, eating disorders and depression.

The former Disney Channel star says she turned to drugs and alcohol to cope with the pressures of fame.

In 2010 she checked herself into rehab after a violent argument with a friend and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

Since then she's found help and has become a spokesperson for mental health awareness.

She was honoured with the Artistic Award of Courage earlier this month in LA for her work as a mental health advocate.

Demi's also released a book and a documentary about people who struggle with mental health problems.

""So many times I wanted to relapse but sat on my hands and begged God to relieve the obsession,"" she continues in the Instagram post.

""I'm so proud of myself but I couldn't have done it without my higher power (God), my family, friends, and everyone else who supported me.

""Feeling humbled and joyful today. Thank you guys for sticking by my side and believing in me.""

Comedy drama by Pete Jackson, set in Alcoholics Anonymous and inspired by his own road to recovery. Starring Sue Johnston, John Hannah, Eddie Marsan, Rebecca Front, Paul Kaye and Julia Deakin.

The programme follows the lives of five very different recovering alcoholics. Set entirely at their weekly meetings, we hear them get to know each other, learn to hate each other, argue, moan, laugh, fall apart, fall in love and, most importantly, tell their stories.

There are funny stories, sad stories, stories of small victories and milestones, stories of loss, stories of hope, and stories that you really shouldn't laugh at - but still do. Along with the storyteller.

In this second episode, Julie's (Sue Johnston) husband comes back to her after six years and it's up to the rest of the group to pick up the pieces.

Hooked on alcohol,Three alcoholics share their experience of addiction and treatment at Sunderland's Lazarus centre.,[],3/30/2005 0:00,"Andrea is an alcoholic. She's been going through a re-hab programme at the Lazarus Centre in Sunderland for the past 10 weeks. She's in her late 20s and her drinking became a problem about six years ago.

Andrea's story Andrea's story

""It started when I met my husband. He's a violent person, not that I'm with him now. I started drinking to look as if I was happy.

""I knew there was a problem: I had to have it. I was drinking between four to six cans and half a bottle of vodka a day"".

Things got worse. Andrea had separated from her husband by now, but Social Services knew about her problems.

""Social Services were going to make orders to take the children, to have them removed if I didn't change my ways, change my drinking, but I just couldn't stop. Even the thought of the children going into care didn't stop me"".

""It's a cycle - you get up, drink, pass out, wake up, drink."" Keith Family troubles

Her two young daughters were eventually taken into care. Andrea's hoping that if she gets through the programme, she will eventually get them back, but she knows she can't leave the Lazarus Centre until both she and her social worker are confident she won't lapse back into drinking.

""At the moment, they don't want to put me back into society - it might trigger me off into going for a drink again. I've got the children to think about - the court date is soon. I want to prove to the judge and the court that I've stopped drinking"".

Andrea knows she can never have an alcoholic drink again.

""It's the first drink - once you have that, the cravings come back and you want another and another, and it just leads you back down that road again. I've wasted five years of my life on drink"".

Help and treatment

The Lazarus Centre uses a 12-step programme developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, but in group sessions, and all the clients are residential for the course of their treatment, which can last from three months to a year.

As clients start to progress and realise they want to change their lives, they are allowed home at weekends, but random alcohol tests mean that if they do lapse, they have to leave the programme. The centre claims a high success rate for those who do stay the course.

Keith's story Keith's story

Keith hasn't had a drink for over two years now. He went through the programme at the Lazarus Centre, and now works there looking after the maintenance of the building.

With some distance from his lowest point, he is able to look back with a great deal of self-knowledge.

""I could go through a bottle and a half of vodka a day and eight to ten cans. It's a cycle - you get up, drink, pass out, wake up, drink.

""It's alright people saying it's a question of willpower - it goes beyond that. It's addiction in the true sense of the word.

""I begged a doctor to section me. You reach a point - rock bottom - when you're so desperate to get out of it you'll do anything. It's either that or die"".

Andy's battle

Andy has just joined the programme at the Lazarus Centre after ending up in hospital in April. He's been battling with drink for 15 years. Now that he's finally admitted he has a problem, he can see the bizarre logic he used to apply to his life.

Andy's story ""I don't smoke because it's bad for you, but I'll drink a bottle and a half of whisky. I don't take drugs because I know I have a compulsive nature.

""But this is the good one - I don't take paracetamol because someone told me they damage your liver. So when I had a headache coming out of an alcohol stupor, I wouldn't take paracetamol in case I hurt my liver. After 30 bottles of Scotch!""

Your comments

The Have your say section is now closed, but here are some of your comments:

James

Lots of material on alcoholism seems to be blaming someone or something for 'triggering' the addiction. I believe my alcoholism was a latent disease waiting to be 'triggered' by my first drink. So much treatment is centred around a defined period of time - sign up, do treatment, signed off cured. My experience is that alcoholics and addicts for that matter, need the support of a twelve step programme and other recovering people for the rest of their lives. Relapse rates are very high with this support and without it alcoholics seem to often slide back into active addiction. 'Professionals are often well intentioned but nothing helps an alcoholic like another recovering alcoholic. This is how I have stayed sober for more than 8 years.

Gavin Ackroyd

The recent statistics that have prompted tonights news story are the affect of past drinking habits, not recent ones. You don't drink heavily for a few months and then die, it is the result of past drinking habits, take Andy's story he has been ""battling with drink for 15 years"". People should look at the bigger picture.

Project5000

I know that there are many differnt reasons why people drink excessively. We are a pub culture and this has got to change. There has to be an alternative. This is why there is a group of us who have set up a compnay to create a non-alcoholic bar for young people 12-25 years. All we need is a property that is as attractive as a pub and off course the money.

Recovering Durham alcoholic starts blog to help others,A recovering alcoholic from Durham is sharing his experiences in beating his addiction in an online blog designed to help others.,[],None,"Image caption Martin Prest drank 83 units in two days

A recovering alcoholic from Durham is sharing his thoughts and experiences in an online blog to help others beat the addiction.

Martin Prest has been sober for 18 months following his daily battle with drink for the past eight years.

He regularly used to drink about 18 pints a day.

He has now set up the informative blog, Open Alcoholic, to catalogue his experience battling alcohol addiction.

""I thought that alcoholism is so difficult sometimes to understand from the outside if you haven't lived it, and after speaking to people over my 18 months sobriety... family members or people who care about them, they can't necessarily understand,"" Mr Prest said.

""They've asked me what it's like and to try an explain this process, this mindset, that they've watched destroy someone and I really wanted to use the website to try and explain it better.""

My entire body was falling apart, I had nothing left in life but the drinking Martin Prest

The 26-year-old uses his blog to explain how he came to terms with his addiction and overcame it, but how it still troubles him.

Mr Prest unknowingly had his first taste of alcohol when he was just seven-years-old.

""It was funny because I didn't know it was alcoholic and I knew I wasn't allowed to drink it,"" he said.

""I started stealing sips of it in the morning when I was seven, it was on a top shelf on a cupboard and I could nip up and get it and have a sip, just because I liked the taste of it, I didn't know what it was or anything.""

Following this early taste his drinking habits became out of control from the age of 18 and he went from being a social drinker to drinking alone and getting drunk.

""I drank until I was drunk and could finally fall asleep, everyday for years. The only time I actually noted down how much I drank was my last weekend drinking,"" he said.

""I knew I was going to stop drinking, I was sort of saying farewell to it and I drank through 83 units in two days, I was drinking mostly bitters and real ale and that's 18 pints and I wasn't drunk - I could still walk straight and I was still holding conversations and stuff, I mean how much I drank when I did get drunk I have no idea, more than that.""

'Spontaneously haemorrhaging'

After years of destroying his body through drink, his health problems became visible.

""My entire body was falling apart, I had nothing left in life but the drinking,"" he said.

""I was spontaneously haemorrhaging, I was bleeding out of my face from the damage that was being done, my head was just exploding in pain constantly my body was just wrecked. I knew I had to stop drinking.""

Mike Scott, a GP in Newcastle, said: ""Liver disease can lose the blood's ability to clot, so therefore you tend to bleed more easily.

""A cut or damage to the skin is arguably going to bleed more with an unhealthy liver.""

Mr Prest, added: ""It's such an insane process because you lose everything and it ruins your life essentially, I mean I've obviously picked back up again but you still want to drink you still want to get drunk, it never ever goes away, it's just engrained in your personality.""

Can a parent save their child from addiction?,The death of Amy Winehouse has once again highlighted the danger of drink and drug addiction.

The death of Amy Winehouse has once again highlighted the danger of drink and drug addiction. Mitch and Janis Winehouse's battles to cure their daughter of her addiction are shared by thousands of parents up and down the country.

Many parents reading of the death at the weekend of singer Amy Winehouse will have thought to themselves: ""What would I do if my son or daughter was an addict?""

Some people, like Tom Methven, know only too well what they would do and whether it would work.

His son, Jason, 29, is an alcoholic.

Mr Methven, from Surrey, said: ""When I heard about Amy Winehouse I thought, 'It's finally got her'.

'Slave to the addiction'

""Drugs and alcohol damage a receptor in the brain. You become a slave. Why else would she have kept taking it? She was a very similar age to my son.""

Hannah Meredith was 17 when she died of a heroin overdose in October 2009.

Image caption Teenager Hannah Meredith wrote a ""letter to heroin"" a month before her death in 2009

A month before she died, she wrote a ""letter to heroin"". Her aunt, Lisa Moore, read out excerpts from the letter on BBC Radio Five Live last year.

Ms Moore told the BBC: ""It takes years to recover but it only takes seconds to relapse.""

She said: ""We heard about Amy Winehouse's death on Saturday and it brought back feelings of what happened to Hannah. It was two years ago, but it's still raw.""

Ms Moore said: ""I've read stuff on Facebook about Amy like 'one less junkie', and it is so ignorant and insensitive. Families feel helpless, they feel like failures, they think, 'How can we fix it when that person is choosing to do it'?""

""What people don't realise is that no matter how badly someone is on drugs nothing ever prepares you for the knock on the door or the phone call, nothing prepares you for their death.""

She said Hannah had been given an ecstasy tablet on her 14th birthday, ""liked the feeling"" and by the age of 15 was on heroin.

Two years later she was ""clean"" but then had her fatal relapse.

""She had been in recovery for four months and was sure she was in control of heroin. She might have thought she would try it one more time,"" said Ms Moore.

Both Ms Moore and Mr Methven said there was a lot of ignorance about substance abuse.

Tough love

They said many people thought they could just lock their son or daughter in a room and make them go ""cold turkey"" - completely denying them drink or drugs - to exorcise their demons.

The cold turkey scene has cropped up in films like Trainspotting and soap operas like EastEnders, where a parent uses so-called ""tough love"".

But Mr Methven says the reality is that it very rarely works.

He has tried almost everything to rescue his son from his alcoholism:

Rehab - two sessions in a £500-a-day private clinic.

Medication - Antabuse, or disulfiram, a tablet which makes the taker sick if he or she drinks alcohol.

Sectioning - a compulsory week in a mental health unit.

Psychiatry - several sessions with a top specialist.

At his worst point Jason, who weighs 19 stone (120kg), was drinking huge quantities of vodka and would become violent and aggressive.

""One time he smashed a piece of glass at his girlfriend's house and cut an artery. I had to follow the trail of blood to find him. They broke up about a month later. She couldn't cope with it,"" said Mr Methven.

He said: ""Another time he was self-harming. He burned himself with an iron and was then banging his head against a table.

""He tried to cut his wrists once with a knife. The police were called and he was taken to hospital.

""He was so drunk he was fighting with the security guards and he got one of them, a big guy, on the floor. Eventually he was given a very strong tranquilliser.""

Mr Methven said his son, who is an only child, had a normal childhood and was very intelligent.

He went to university and got a first with honours before embarking on a PhD.

Out of control

But his drinking, which had started as a teenager, got out of control and he never completed it.

Jason is now unemployed and gets £20 a week in Disability Living Allowance.

""That is supposed to be given to his mum for laundry and shopping but it is in many respects money for alcohol,"" said his father.

Mr Methven said: ""He was about 24 when we realised he had a real problem. We went to the doctor and got a referral.

""We wanted to get him into rehab but it took so long on the NHS that we panicked and went private.""

Jason has been into rehab twice.

There is no alcohol in the house now. I used to have some good quality wine. It was very well hid. I was going to give it to a friend as a present but it was gone. He had drunk it John Methven, Father of an alcoholic

On one occasion Mr Methven spent £18,000 and he said: ""Before the cheque was even dry he was back on the drink.""

He said: ""There is no alcohol in the house now. I used to have some good-quality wine. It was very well hid. I was going to give it to a friend as a present but it was gone. He had drunk it.""

Mr Methven said his son had stolen money from him and his wife and had also taken DVDs and other property and sold it at cash converter shops to provide drinking money.

'Secretive' drinking

""It's always secretive drinking. He doesn't go to the pub. He just drinks in his room. He hid it in rucksacks or under the hedge in the garden,"" he said.

Jason has now joined Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and has a sponsor, but he is still drinking.

""He is trying to take it down. Yesterday he had six cans (of beer) and today it's four. He is still drinking but it's far less,"" said Mr Methven.

But he said the crucial thing was that Jason has now said he wants to stop.

Image caption Nicholas Mills (pictured) hanged himself after a drug-fuelled argument but his twin brother survived and is now clean

""If they are going to get well they have got to go to AA or NA (Narcotics Anonymous). The individual is powerless, but collectively they can do it. It's a spiritual thing. AA is about giving it up altogether.

""Once you are an alcoholic or an addict one is too many and 100 is not enough.""

Asked how he feels about his son now, he said: ""It's not so much shame as disappointment about what he could have done with his life.""

While Mr Methven can understand the addiction, Elizabeth Burton-Phillips knows the heartbreak of what she calls the ""double whammy"" of addiction and death.

Her twin sons, Nicholas and Simon, both became heroin addicts.

Nicholas died in 2004 but Simon survived and has kicked the habit.

Mrs Burton-Phillips, from Buckinghamshire, has since set up a charity, DrugFam, and she told the BBC: ""We are trying to help families who are struggling to cope with the addiction of their loved ones, like Amy and my son.""

She said she met Amy's mother in 2008 and added: ""I have been in text contact with her since Amy passed and they are obviously going to be terribly badly affected.""

Mrs Burton-Phillips travelled to Llanelli on Monday to give her moral support to the Hannah Meredith Foundation, which launched a support group for the families of those in the Carmarthenshire area coping with substance abuse.

Anyone wanting to contact the foundation should do so through their Facebook page.

Sadie Frost says Mirror hacking caused 'living hell',"Actress Sadie Frost tells a hearing phone hacking by Mirror Group journalists made her life ""a living hell"" for many years.",[],None,"Image copyright BBC Sport Image caption Frost said hacking by Mirror journalists affected her relationship with fellow actor Jude Law

Actress Sadie Frost has told the High Court that having her phone hacked by Mirror Group journalists made her life a ""living hell"".

Describing the experience as the ""lowest of the low"", the 49-year-old actress and businesswoman said she did not know who to trust.

In 2003, she had a breakdown and went into hospital, which was a ""terrible"" incident but ended up in the papers.

Ms Frost is among eight high-profile figures claiming damages for hacking.

She told the court: ""Your father is dying, you are going through divorce, you have postnatal depression, you are in and out of hospital, my baby was ill, he was born premature.

""I was at breaking point, I could not sleep, or eat, and I did not know who to trust as information kept getting into the media.

""I needed my loved ones around me. I was very upset, I was a very, very unhappy person.

""Every time I turned to someone to confide in them, it ended up in the newspapers, which added to my distress and trauma.""

""I couldn't go and sit with my mum and have a cup of tea because I thought she was selling stories. I didn't trust my own mother.""

'Panic attacks'

Ms Frost said her separation from fellow actor Jude Law was very difficult.

""I thought it might be Jude, trying to make me look bad for custody reasons, or my friends or family using me for their own gains. Either thought was heartbreaking.

""This was a deeply stressful time in my life and the fact my insecurities were being publicised obviously made it worse.""

She described how friends, particularly model Kate Moss, questioned whether they could trust her.

""Even worse than that, Jude, the father of my children, thought for years that I was selling stories which created an animosity between us that has only really disappeared since the revelations about phone hacking.""

Image caption Sadie Frost said she was 'humiliated' when a story emerged about her attending an AA meeting

Ms Frost said: ""I couldn't take my youngest son to the park for two years because he was photographed. He would cry and I would get panic attacks.

""I lost two to three years of my life, they wanted me to fail.

She told the hearing that it felt like she and those closest to her were ""being monitored and hunted down by a sort of secret police"".

""Every area of my life was affected. There was nowhere I could go that was safe.""

""If I went to the doctor or gynaecologist, details would be in the newspaper.""

'Embarrassed and humiliated'

Ms Frost said she was left ""incredibly embarrassed and humiliated"" when a story emerged about her attending an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

She said she had been advised to go a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous ""because it was a safe place"".

""Someone quite high-profile took me there and I went there after everyone said it would be safe and anonymous,"" she told the court.

""I was portrayed as troubled, sad, as a party-girl. That's not why people go to AA, they go there to get help and be in a safe place.""

She added: ""I was portrayed for so long as a complete mess that I have had to overcome people's perception of me to rebuild my reputation as a successful businesswoman. I can only guess at the position I would be in if none of this had happened.""

She said that the apology she had received from Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) was ""rather too little too late"".

The hearing at the High Court in London is considering what compensation should be paid by MGN to Ms Frost, alongside BBC creative director Alan Yentob, soap stars Shane Richie, Shobna Gulati and Lucy Taggart, former footballer Paul Gascoigne, TV producer Robert Ashworth and flight attendant Lauren Alcorn.","['trust', 'jude', 'mirror', 'caused', 'thought', 'court', 'sadie', 'told', 'went', 'safe', 'hacking', 'frost', 'life', 'hell', 'living']","Image copyright BBC Sport Image caption Frost said hacking by Mirror journalists affected her relationship with fellow actor Jude LawActress Sadie Frost has told the High Court that having her phone hacked by Mirror Group journalists made her life a ""living hell"".

Angela Wrightson: Killer girls bid to extend anonymity,The two girls were just 13 and 14 when they murdered vulnerable Angela Wrightson in 2014.,[],None,"Image caption Angela Wrightson suffered more than 70 separate slash injuries and 54 blunt-force injuries

Two girls who were 13 and 14 when they murdered a vulnerable alcoholic in her own home are taking legal action to remain anonymous into adulthood.

Angela Wrightson, 39, was subjected to a seven-hour attack in her Hartlepool home by the pair in December 2014.

Both girls, who were not named in court because of their age, were jailed for a minimum of 15 years in April 2016.

The High Court is due to consider whether the ban on identifying the killers can be extended indefinitely.

The girls' legal team has already obtained an interim injunction extending their anonymity, although one of them has now turned 18.

Image copyright Cleveland Police Image caption The two girls returned to Ms Wrightson's home in the early hours of 9 December, where they would continue the attack

The original trial judge, Mr Justice Globe, imposed reporting restrictions preventing the media from identifying the girls, on account of them being under 18 and due to their vulnerability.

The issue will go before the High Court next month, where their legal teams will argue the media's ban on reporting their identities should be extended.

The current interim injunction applies to media reports, and all other internet postings.

Mr Justice Globe halted a first trial at Teesside Crown Court and imposed a ban on reporting the second hearing months later in Leeds after he was alerted to hundreds of social media posts written about the girls.

He later described them as ""a blitz of extreme and disturbing comments posted on Facebook by members of the public"".

Ms Wrightson, known locally as Alco Angela, was attacked after allowing the girls into her Stephen Street home to drink alcohol.

A subsequent inquiry into the case found care home staff could not lock doors to prevent the older girl from running away and it heard that she had a chaotic family life.

The younger girl had been placed in foster care after her parents complained of being unable to cope.

Both girls were known to drink and take drugs.

After the attack, the girls boasted to friends about being given a lift home by police, who were unaware of the murder.","['anonymity', 'wrightson', 'reporting', 'caption', 'killer', 'image', 'court', 'legal', 'ban', 'girls', 'extend', 'media', 'angela', 'bid']","Image caption Angela Wrightson suffered more than 70 separate slash injuries and 54 blunt-force injuriesTwo girls who were 13 and 14 when they murdered a vulnerable alcoholic in her own home are taking legal action to remain anonymous into adulthood.

How jeans giant Levi Strauss got its mojo back,The US clothing firm is now enjoying five years of profit growth as it recovers from past woes.,"['Russell Hotten', 'Business Reporter', 'Bbc News']",None,"Image copyright Levi Strauss

Chip Bergh has the air of man at ease with the world. But things could have turned out very different, given what he calls his ""dysfunctional"" childhood.

The 60-year-old chief executive of Levi Strauss, dressed in regulation blue jeans and denim shirt, readily admits to be being ""blessed and lucky"".

Six years into his successful turnaround of the once struggling US clothing firm, he says the job still gives him a ""wow"" feeling.

Mr Bergh and his family also love their San Francisco lifestyle, where the vegan boss pursues a passion for marathons and triathlons.

So, professionally and personally, things are going well for the former Procter & Gamble (P&G) executive.

But growing up in the suburbs of New York City there were times when he felt neither blessed nor lucky.

Mr Bergh's father was an advertising salesman working 14-hour days. He was also an alcoholic.

Image copyright Devaki Knowles

There could be ""lots of screaming and yelling"" at home, Mr Bergh recalls. ""Mum and dad were always getting in fights.""

One day his mother threatened to throw out his dad. ""That was a wake up call,"" says Mr Bergh.

His father then finally went to Alcoholics Anonymous, cleaned himself up and never touched another drop.

""I'm proud that my dad recovered,"" says Mr Bergh. ""He rebuilt his life.""

Mr Bergh's childhood wasn't unhappy. ""I had a lot of friends, played a lot of sport, and went to a great school,"" he says. But as the eldest of three children he says he shouldered much of the domestic discord, and grew up fast.

It left its mark and is in part behind his drive to succeed, he thinks. It also left a determination not to repeat some of his father's mistakes.

""I'm pretty level-headed,"" says Mr Bergh. ""There's not a lot that really upsets me. I'm not a yeller and screamer, at home or work. I'm pretty relaxed."" And he doesn't drink.

Image copyright Levi Strauss Image caption Levi Strauss emigrated to the US from Germany in 1853 when he was 18

So, how does Mr Bergh sum up his management style? ""Very open, honest, transparent. What you see is what you get.""

He insists he's ""really down to earth"", adding: ""I put my pants on the same way everybody else does - one leg at a time.""

Just don't confuse this regular-guy image with a lack of steel, as Mr Bergh's overhaul of Levi's has been radical, some might say brutal.

The company was created in 1873 when San Francisco-based wholesale merchant Levi Strauss and a business partner patented a way to strengthen denim trousers using copper rivets. The rest as they say is history.

Through slick advertising and campaigning on social and political issues (such as donating millions to HIV/Aids charities), Levi's punched above its weight for decades.

Stories were common in the 1960s and 1970s of young Westerners packing Levi's jeans in their luggage to help barter their way through holidays behind the Iron Curtain.

If ever a brand deserved the label ""iconic"", Levi's was it.

Image copyright Levi Strauss Image caption The Levi 501 jeans are arguably the company's single most important product

But by the time Mr Bergh took over in 2011, the company he calls the original Silicon Valley start-up ""had lost its way"".

Annual sales peaked in 1997 at $7.1bn (£5.3bn). ""We were bigger than Nike then,"" says Mr Bergh. ""Nike aspired to be like Levi's.""

But Levi's lost its knack of combining heritage with changing trends, and by the early 2000s sales had fallen to $4bn.

Competition from the likes of Walmart and Gap had increased rapidly. Levi had also borrowed heavily, chiefly to buy out scores of Strauss family descendants, and consolidate ownership.

The result, says Mr Bergh, was that the firm found it had to ""cut costs, cut marketing, to save cash"".

Levi's board ultimately decided it needed a fresh pair of hands, and so turned to Mr Bergh, who had the brand expertise and international experience it wanted.

After 28 years at P&G, most latterly working on the Old Spice deodorant and razors accounts, Mr Bergh saw a chance to fulfil an ambition to become a chief executive.

""It was too good an opportunity to pass,"" he says. ""It was an opportunity to make a difference, and leave a legacy.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chip Bergh is not afraid to ""double denim""

All too aware that Levi's was struggling, Mr Bergh sent the firm's then top 60 managers six questions about the pros and cons of the business - and started interviewing each of them.

""But by about the 15th interview it was pretty clear what needed to be done,"" he says. ""There was no strategy, there was no alignment across the organisation... People were frustrated.""

More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world:

Mr Bergh invested in facilities, broadened the clothing range (especially womenswear), and expanded in relatively untapped markets such as Russia, China and India.

The ecommerce operation, previously outsourced and treated almost as an after-thought, was brought in-house, modernised and expanded.

Mr Bergh also changed the top team at the business. Within 18 months of his appointment, nine of the 11-member executive team had left. Of the current 150 senior managers, two-thirds have been with the company for three years or less.

He says: ""We needed to change not just the business but the culture, and the best way to change the culture is to change the leadership.""

Mr Bergh admits the clear out was dramatic, sometimes traumatic, but says: ""You always have to do the harder right than the easier wrong.""

Did he learn such decisiveness in the army, which he joined for two years after school? Making quick decisions was certainly part of the skill-set, he says. But the army also taught him about leadership.

""It's wrong that the army is all about deference and saluting seniors,"" he says. ""You have to earn respect, build trust, be willing to make decisions, coach people and train people - all those skills are transferable to the corporate world.""

The army's downside was that promotion moved slowly, and Mr Bergh wanted to ""move ahead quickly"". A recruitment firm found him a job at P&G.

Levi's turnaround seems to be succeeding, with 2017 expected to see the fifth consecutive year of profits growth.

State must 'go further' to help addicts,"The state should do more to help addicts and make them employable, Iain Duncan Smith says, with removing benefits a ""hypothetical"" option.",[],None,"Image copyright SPL Image caption Some say withdrawing benefits from drug users would lead them into crime

The state should intervene further to help drug and alcohol addicts recover and make them employable in future, a senior cabinet minister has said.

In a speech to Alcoholics Anonymous, Iain Duncan Smith argued that addicts who are unable to work are being let down by the welfare system.

The BBC understands removing benefits from people refusing treatment will be an option but a ""hypothetical"" one.

One drug charity said such a move would set a ""dangerous precedent"".

In 2010, the Home Office considered plans to remove benefits from addicts who refused treatment as part of the government's drug strategy but these were not pursued.

According to the Department for Work and Pensions, 40,000 people claim incapacity benefits - citing alcoholism as their primary condition. Of these, about a third have been claiming for more than a decade.

The government also says 80% of the UK's 400,000 ""problem drug users"" are claiming out-of-work benefits.

'Road to recovery'

In a speech in Parliament, Mr Duncan Smith said ""the outdated benefits system fails to get people off drugs and put their lives on track"".

""We have started changing how addicts are supported but we must go further to actively take on the devastation that drugs and alcohol can cause.

""We want to do more to encourage and support claimants into rehabilitation for addiction and starting them on the road to recovery and eventually work.""

There is no evidence that using the stick of benefit sanctions will help people to positively engage with treatment and support their recovery Martin Barnes, DrugScope

Mr Duncan Smith said the introduction of a single, consolidated benefit known as Universal Credit from next year - more details of which will be published on Thursday - will simplify the benefits system and provide more financial incentives for employment, helping all claimants.

""Getting people into work and encouraging independence is our ultimate goal,"" he added.

""Universal Credit will put people on a journey towards sustainable recovery so they are better placed to look for work in future.""

The BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason said Mr Duncan Smith, in his speech, hinted that a lack of willingness to seek help for addictions could lead to a cut in benefits.

But a source close to the minister emphasised that the universal credit would make it easier to ""track people through the system"" and ensure they get the help they need.

""Hypothetically people could lose benefits,"" the source told the BBC. ""You do have to have sanctions. But very few people refuse treatment.""

'No evidence'

Charities said many addicts were not receiving the support they needed at job centres and through the government's flagship welfare-to-work programme.

One of these, DrugScope, said it would be asking ministers to ""clarify"" their position on sanctions for refusing treatment.

""We are surprised and concerned at reports that ministers believe that stopping benefits is an appropriate or effective way of engaging people with drug or alcohol treatment and supporting their recovery,"" said its chief executive Martin Barnes

""If accurate, this would be a reversal of the government's publicly stated position.""

It said ministers had dropped plans, proposed by the previous Labour government, to require all those attending job centres to answer questions about possible drug and alcohol use.

""There is no evidence that using the stick of benefit sanctions will help people to positively engage with treatment and support their recovery,"" Mr Barnes added.

""Indeed, the risk is that people will disengage from support services, potentially worsening their dependency and the impacts on their families and communities. Linking benefit to a requirement to undergo treatment would set a dangerous precedent for people with physical or mental health problems.""

All those claiming employment and support allowance - which has replaced incapacity benefit - are currently being re-assessed under plans aimed at getting more people into work and reducing the welfare bill.

Critics have complained that the medical tests being used are flawed and too many people are being deemed fit to work when they are not.","['treatment', 'addicts', 'benefits', 'drug', 'work', 'state', 'smith', 'help', 'recovery', 'benefit', 'support']","Image copyright SPL Image caption Some say withdrawing benefits from drug users would lead them into crimeThe state should intervene further to help drug and alcohol addicts recover and make them employable in future, a senior cabinet minister has said.

Former alcoholic 'scared' by rise in young drinkers,"A recovering alcoholic from Norfolk says he is ""scared"" by the rise in the number of young people with drink problems.","['Jo Thewlis', 'Bbc News']",None,"Image caption Recovering alcoholic Patrick Martin is 'scared' by the rise in the number of young drinkers

A recovering alcoholic from Norfolk says he is ""scared"" by the rise in the number of young people with drink problems at his support group.

Patrick Martin, 64, once drank a litre of vodka a day at the height of his alcohol addiction.

Mr Martin, who has been sober for three years, has lost two partners to alcohol-related illnesses.

Now he is worried by the rise in the number of young people at his Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

""We are getting more young people at meetings, particularly young women,"" he said.

""They are getting really ill through drinking and it scares me for future generations.

""My heart goes out to them. I wish I could tell them what I've been through.""

'Wallowed in sadness'

Mr Martin, who lives in Norwich, said he has seen a sharp rise in young people aged between 22 to 28 coming to the group.

I just locked the door, drew the curtains, pulled the telephone wire out and just wallowed in my own sadness Patrick Martin

Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show the rate of alcohol-related deaths for 15 to 34-year-olds in the UK has almost doubled in nearly 20 years.

In 1991, 137 young people aged between 15 and 34 died of alcohol-related problems. Of those, 48 were women.

By 2009, the total number of alcohol-related deaths had risen to 261, of which 94 were women.

""The stories we hear from these young people are harrowing to say the least,"" Mr Martin said.

""They let their hair down at weekends but these weekends tend to get out of hand for a lot of them.""

Mr Martin said his drink problem started to escalate in his late 20s, when he drank as a way to escape the pressure he felt in his work as a pottery designer.

At the height of his addiction, Mr Martin said would sometimes go without eating for two weeks when on a drinking binge.

""I just locked the door, drew the curtains, pulled the telephone wire out and just wallowed in my own sadness,"" he said.

""When you are drinking, your only thoughts from the moment you wake up until the moment you pass out is where you can get your next drink from. Nothing else matters.""

'Rock bottom'

Mr Martin said his alcohol problem has shortened his life and robbed him of his marriage and his relationship with his son.

Two former partners have also died of alcohol-related illnesses in the past six years, he added.

Despite attending Alcoholics Anonymous for almost 30 years, Mr Martin said he decided to stop drinking quite suddenly three-and-a-half years ago.

""I just put the drink down one day,"" he said. ""I had reached my rock bottom and climbed back up but a lot of people don't.""

Mr Martin, who has now retired for health reasons, is calling for better education to help stem the rising tide of young drinkers.

""You are not going to stop people drinking by putting alcohol prices up,"" he said.

""If you are desperate for alcohol, you will steal to get it.

""I don't think the health services or Government take the problem seriously enough or realise how serious it will be in a few years.

""If they carry on drinking, a lot of these young people will be in the same boat as me in 10 years time.""","['martin', 'alcohol', 'rise', 'problem', 'drinkers', 'drink', 'young', 'alcoholic', 'drinking', 'scared', 'number', 'alcoholrelated', 'mr']","Image caption Recovering alcoholic Patrick Martin is 'scared' by the rise in the number of young drinkersA recovering alcoholic from Norfolk says he is ""scared"" by the rise in the number of young people with drink problems at his support group.

'How I lost my dad to alcohol addiction',"Exclusive music news, big interviews, entertainment, social media trends and video from the news people at BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra.",['Interview Hannah Moore'],None,"When Charlotte's dad was taken to hospital he couldn't open his mouth any more.

His face was paralysed and his heart and liver had become enlarged after years of drinking far too much alcohol.

Then one by one, his internal organs shut down. He died just before Christmas last year, aged 59.

But Charlotte, 27, tells Newsbeat she feels like she lost him to alcohol addiction years ago.

""In your teenage years you become more aware of your parents' behaviour,"" she says.

""I'd realise that finding bottles of wine hidden behind the sofa isn't normal. Finding dad passed out in front of the television at two o'clock in the morning isn't normal.""

I'd realise that finding bottles of wine hidden behind the sofa isn't normal

Hiding it

Charlotte was about 15 when she realised her dad, Iain Hayman, was having problems with alcohol.

""The older I got the more I realised his relationship with alcohol was incredibly unhealthy because he was hiding it. He'd lie to mum and say, 'I haven't had a drink today' and you'd think, 'I saw you earlier. Yes you did.'

""We never knew how much he was drinking. It started off with a bottle of wine a night and then it would go up to three or four.

""Every time you find a bottle of wine you struggle with 'Do I dob him in and cause an argument or do I lie to my mum?'

""The more you tidied, the more you found out about dad.""

'It's quite an embarrassing illness'

Charlotte explains how her father was effectively ""living two lives"".

""I'd come home from school and he'd be asleep in bed. He'd be really down,"" she says.

""It was a slow deterioration. Every time he felt positive you really wanted to get behind him and support him, which is what he needed..

I'll have days when I remember the nice things, and then there are days when I have the horrible memories

""But the more it happened and the more he failed, it became difficult to put that aside.

""He was living two lives because until I was 18 it didn't really come out that he was an alcoholic

""He hid very well that he wasn't paying the mortgage [on our house].

""It came out that we were really close to losing the house. We had bailiffs knocking on the door.

""I was working in the village pub and you'd often be told stories like 'Charlotte, I saw your dad passed out on the path and I almost tripped over him.'

""It's quite an embarrassing illness for your parent to have because they lose their inhibitions and don't care what people think of them.""

Daddy's girl

""I was a proper daddy's girl. We were very close.

Your teenage years are difficult enough. To have that as an extra worry, you just don't need it.

""I have so many nice memories of him. I'll have days when I remember the nice things, and then there are days when I have the horrible memories and I think of him drunk, and I think of him not able to stop for us.

""It's a mixed bag of emotions because you have the anger that he did this to himself.""

Role reversal

""It was a role reversal because you end up looking out for him and making sure he gets ready for the day. And then always worrying about what he was doing.

""Your teenage years are difficult enough. To have that as an extra worry, you just don't need it.

""You should be able to rely on your parents to help you and support you, and it just wasn't there [from him]. Emotionally it's very difficult.""

I distanced myself from him

After years of struggling with the effects of Iain's addiction, Charlotte's mum decided she couldn't take any more. She asked him to move out of their home last year.

Sadly, that's when his drinking increased. He'd lost his job and even began stealing alcohol.

""In the last year I distanced myself from him because I found it too difficult. You really wanted to get behind him and support him, but the more he failed [to stop drinking] it became difficult to put that aside.

""He was in a bad way again, he was out of breath. And then he ended up fainting, got an ambulance to the hospital, and then he never came out.

""He couldn't even talk for the last three weeks of his life.

""You have this anger that he's done this to himself. But we all just had to put it to one side and we just had to be forgiving.

""Now we can grieve the man we lost when I was a teenager.""

Heavy drinking by older people is causing a major public health risk in the UK, yet the issue often falls below the radar.

While alcohol consumption among the young is falling, the over 60s are drinking more, and more harmfully, with one in three developing problems with alcohol for the first time in later life and alcohol-related hospital admissions among the old rising alarmingly.

BBC reporter Leala Padmanabhan investigates, starting with the story of her own father who developed alcoholism in his 70s while caring for her mother, who has alcoholism-related dementia. Despite his background as a doctor and his long experience of witnessing his wife's alcoholism, Leala's father was unable to rehabilitate himself, and his drink problem helped contribute to his death in 2010.

Leala's family is the starting point for a programme telling her own and similar stories.

A large number of people are developing problems in later life, partly because of social factors associated with their age, such as loneliness, bereavement, depression and boredom.

In addition to these late-onset drinkers there is a large number of ""baby boomers"" who are carrying heavy drinking patterns into old age.

And yet alcohol problems are less likely to be detected in older people, and where problems are detected, they are less likely to be referred to an alcohol service for treatment.

Smashed: Mary Elizabeth Winstead on playing an alcoholic,An independent film about an elementary schoolteacher with a drinking problem has been tipped as a potential awards contender. BBC News speaks to its director and stars.,"['Neil Smith', 'Entertainment', 'Arts Reporter', 'Bbc News']",None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Leading lady Mary Elizabeth Winstead tells the BBC why she took on her most dramatic role to date

A low-budget independent film about an elementary schoolteacher with a drinking problem has been tipped as a potential awards contender. BBC News spoke to its director and stars.

Movie awards voters tend to be impressed by hard-hitting studies of alcoholism, regularly rewarding films that have highlighted the perils of the demon drink.

Ray Milland won an Oscar in 1946 for playing a drunkard in The Lost Weekend, as did Nicolas Cage, 50 years later, for imbibing himself to death in Leaving Las Vegas.

Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne and Jeff Bridges were also given Hollywood's highest accolade for playing characters partial to a tipple.

It can work for actresses too. Elizabeth Taylor received her second Oscar for playing a boozy harridan in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, while Lee Remick got a nomination for going blotto in Days of Wine and Roses.

All of which bodes well for Mary Elizabeth Winstead, whose portrayal of Kate, a young wife trying to stay off the sauce in the independent film Smashed, is being tipped as a dark horse in this year's awards race.

Only last month, she was nominated for a Spirit award, alongside Jennifer Lawrence (from Silver Linings Playbook) and child performer Quvenzhane Wallis (from Beasts of the Southern Wild).

Could an Oscar nomination follow in January? During a visit to London last month, the 28-year-old was studiously playing down her chances.

'Wonderful imagination'

""I'm very aware my chances are not very high so I'm not getting my hopes up,"" says the actress, previously seen in quirky movies like Scott Pilgrim vs The World and Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof.

""But it's lovely to hear anyone say anything like that about a performance I've done, and I certainly can't help but fantasise about the idea of being a part of it in some way.""

""I had seen Mary in big action films like Die Hard 4.0 and the remake of The Thing,"" says Smashed director James Ponsoldt, whose work won a special jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival last January.

""But spending time with her, I realised what a wonderful imagination she has and how willing she was to really prepare for this role.""

Those sentiments are shared by actor Aaron Paul, who took a break from playing a crystal meth dealer in TV's Breaking Bad to appear as Charlie, Kate's free-spirited, perennially intoxicated husband.

""The goal in this business is to get lost in the scenes and truly feel like you're living moments as if they were your own,"" says the 33-year-old.

""That happened pretty much every day on set with Mary. It was great and a wonderful experience.""

Should accolades come in Smashed's direction, it would be quite a coup for a film shot in just 19 days for a reported $500,000 (£312,557).

Not only that, but it would also surely be the first movie so honoured to feature a teacher publicly relieving herself on a convenience store floor.

For Winstead, used to projecting glamorous self-assurance on red carpets and in photo shoots, fabricating something so indecorous and unladylike must have posed a challenge.

Apparently, though, such considerations were secondary compared to the need to make an artificial bladder function on cue.

'Not propaganda'

""What's funny in scenes like that is that sometimes the technical aspects end up overriding everything else,"" the actress smiles.

""I was wearing this... 'device', and when I sat down I had to put my arm on my leg to activate it.

""And it wasn't working - every take it wasn't working. On every take everyone was behind the camera going, 'Is it going to work?'

""So it really got rid of all of the humiliation of doing that scene, because all the focus was on hoping that it worked and that we could actually get the scene done.""

Winstead's character is driven to seek help from Alcoholics Anonymous, much to the chagrin of her hard-drinking husband.

Image caption The cast of Smashed includes Octavia Spencer (right), who won an Oscar this year for The Help

The film takes a fairly uncritical view of the organisation, which is depicted by Ponsoldt and his co-writer Susan Burke as a benignly tolerant force for social good.

""Susan and I have very complicated feelings towards AA,"" says the director. ""We both know people whose lives have been saved by it, and we know people who left because they thought it was a cult.

""We didn't want to glorify it; this is certainly not a propaganda film. Nor did we want to take easy shots at it.

""We just wanted the scenes at AA to feel honest and true, so we went to great lengths to make sure they were accurate.""

As graphic as Smashed becomes, particularly when Paul and Winstead's characters are at their most inebriated, it is not inconceivable the film could benefit the organisation.

Winstead is happy for it to have a dual purpose, saying it would be ""fantastic"" if the film was ""used in any sort of positive way"".

""People have come up to me after screenings who work with alcoholics and feel it would be a great tool for them to use,"" she says.

""I think the reason they feel that way is it feels more real than other films on the subject, and a lot more relatable to people of this generation.""

'Recovery point'

Smashed is not the only film around at present to have an alcoholic protagonist. Another is Flight, out in the UK in February, in which Denzel Washington plays an airline pilot waging his own battle with the bottle.

Winstead admits it is ""interesting"" for the two to emerge at the same time but insists that they are ""very different films"".

""Smashed is about a person getting their life together, while Flight is about somebody in the throes of alcoholism who can't get to that recovery point,"" she muses.

Image caption Denzel Washington plays a pilot in Flight found to be harbouring a dark secret

""Although they are both anchored and rooted in alcoholism, they tell very different stories.""

""I think it's funny in a quirky, cosmic way that they both came out so close to each other,"" laughs Ponsoldt. ""I just wish we had Flight's marketing budget.

""But I see it as a win for everybody. The world is better when both the independents and studios are making movies for adults that deal with serious issues that pertain to everyone's lives.""

So how does one set about playing an addict? For Aaron Paul, the most effective route to finding his character was also the simplest.

""What I did for research was drink - a lot more than I had ever in my entire life,"" he reveals. ""I filmed myself getting severely intoxicated and I studied the tapes.

""I also went onto YouTube and typed in 'drunk people acting crazy',"" he continues. ""It's incredible what you can find out there.""

Elizabeth Taylor received her second Oscar for playing a boozy harridan in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, while Lee Remick got a nomination for going blotto in Days of Wine and Roses.
All of which bodes well for Mary Elizabeth Winstead, whose portrayal of Kate, a young wife trying to stay off the sauce in the independent film Smashed, is being tipped as a dark horse in this year's awards race.

Harrogate schools to use drama to tackle teenage drinking,Schools in North Yorkshire are piloting a theatre scheme which aims to educate children about the dangers of alcohol.,[],None,"Image caption The play tells the life-story of the American millionaire who founded Alcoholics Anonymous

Schools in North Yorkshire are piloting a theatre scheme which aims to educate teenagers about the dangers of alcohol.

Harrogate has one of the highest levels of alcohol-related hospital admissions for under 18s in Yorkshire, according to the Centre for Public Health.

The play, by Bryan Bounds, is about the life of Bill Wilson the found of Alcoholics Anonymous.

Mr Bounds said the drama allowed students to learn about alcoholism and its destructive effects.

'Growing concern'

My Name is Bill, which is performed by Mr Bounds, the founder of the Leeds-based Amerrycan Theatre, was shown to critical praise at the Edinburgh Fringe and has been adapted for use in education.

Mr Bounds, himself a recovering alcoholic, said: ""I've watched with growing concern about how alcohol has become such a big issue for young people.

""A lot of alcohol education is quite patronising and condescending but students are very switched on, very sophisticated.""

The Centre for Public Health said Harrogate was second only to Wakefield in Yorkshire for alcohol-related hospital admissions for under 18s.

The drama is being shown to Year 12 students at Ashville College and St Aiden's School.

Marion Farrar, business liaison officer at St Aiden's School, said: ""I think young people see alcohol as a norm these days which is a worrying trend.

'What I learned from confronting my alcoholic mum',"Exclusive music news, big interviews, entertainment, social media trends and video from the news people at BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra.",['Hannah Moore'],None,"Caitlin Croft was 12 when she first tried to talk to her mum Tracey about her alcohol problem.

Every afternoon after work, Tracey would lock herself in her room and drink until she fell asleep, normally having a bottle of vodka a night.

Caitlin, now 17, found it hard to confront her mum. But it was worthwhile because, after more than a decade of addiction, Tracey's now in recovery and hasn't had a drink for eight months.

Here's what Caitlin has learned.

Anyone can have alcohol problems

Seeing her mum's struggle with alcohol made Caitlin realise that anyone can get addicted.

""When you picture an alcoholic you don't think of an 'ordinary' person,"" says Caitlin.

""You'd think of a homeless person having those problems, not a normal average person with a family and home.""

But it's not uncommon. The government says around 1.6 million adults in England have some level of alcohol dependence.

And almost 11 million are drinking enough to harm their health.

Despite drinking heavily every night, Tracey managed to keep her job.

So from the outside it may not have been obvious she had a problem.

Ignoring the addiction won't make it go away

For several months Caitlin avoided talking to her mum about her addiction.

""Every night I'd be in my room on my own, and I knew my mum would be next door drunk,"" she explains.

""I told myself so many times that if I just ignore it she'll get better. But I just saw it getting worse.""

I told myself so many times that if I just ignore it she'll get better

So Caitlin says she learned to confront Tracey in the mornings when she was sober, instead of talking to her while she was drunk.

""Then she could understand me a bit more,"" she says.

""I learned that it's easier to get everything out in the open, rather than hiding it and pretending it will just go away.""

Make sure you've got evidence

Telling someone they've got an alcohol problem is a serious thing to do.

You need to think carefully about what you will say to them, Caitlin explains.

""I couldn't just accuse mum of being drunk.

She thought she was hiding it, but I knew when she was drunk

""I didn't know what type of mood she would be in, so I always used to plan in my head how I was going to [approach her].""

She says she realised that her mum may not have known how much she was drinking.

""She was in denial and she thought she was hiding it, but I knew when she was drunk.

""So I used to tear her room apart looking for bottles.

""I found 10, 20 bottles hidden under her bed, under her pillow, in her drawers.

""Then I had evidence. It was clear she had been drinking, and then it was harder for her to deny it.""

Tracey tells Newsbeat this approach helped her confront her problem. But it wouldn't work for everyone with alcohol dependency.

Encourage them to get help

Tracey started to drink heavily after her husband left the family.

""Over time I started to understand why she had a drink problem,"" explains Caitlin.

A lot of people don't understand that it's an illness

""It affected my mum's health - mentally, physically and emotionally.""

Caitlin and her older brothers encouraged their mum to seek medical help.

Tracey's drinking had left her with an inflamed liver, a condition which can be life threatening.

She was also suffering mental problems, and ended up spending a lot of time in hospital.

""A lot of people don't understand that it's an illness, just like anything else you get diagnosed with.

""So even though it's hard you have to see it from their point of view.""

Get support for yourself, too

Alcohol dependency doesn't just damage the person who is drinking. It affects everyone around them.

""It's not nice to see your mum in that position and there's not really a lot you can do to help,"" says Caitlin.

""It was tiring to see her not making any improvements.""

Caitlin says she found it helpful to talk to her friends and to her older brothers.

And she moved in with one of them when Tracey's illness was at its worst, which helped her concentrate on the other parts of her life like revising for her GCSEs.

Together, the family helped Tracey to get better.

My Brother has been an alcoholic for over 15 years now, coupled with scar tissue from a head injury which is inoperable and cannot be treated but would be manageable without the presence of alcohol. In our opinion he is not safe nor capable of living on his own and carrying out normal daily tasks. He suffers from siezures and we often find him in hospital. He has been admitted to a psychiatic ward for his alcohol abuse, dried out and sent home. He wasnt offered any rehabilitation afterwards because there was no room for him. It has long been our opinion that Mark has been cheated of the chance to beat his addiction because no after care is ever given. Try telling an alcoholic to go home after 10 days in a clinic and don't do it again. How is it that other people get onto programmes such as James Kingham but Mark has been overlooked for years now. We are all trudging a very long emotional road which has, in particular, made my Mother very sick. Mark has on several occassions been ready to quit but hasn't been given the support he so desperately deserves and needs. SEE ALSO

Sex addiction: 'Five times a day wasn't enough',,[],2018-05-01 23:28:50+00:00,"Image caption Rebecca Barker said sex addiction took over her life and ruined her relationship

Sex addiction divides expert opinion, but for some people it is a very real condition that can be shameful and even ""life-destroying"". As relationship charity Relate calls for help to be made available on the NHS, two sufferers speak about the impact it has had on their lives.

""At its worst, even having sex five times a day wasn't enough.""

Mother-of-three Rebecca Barker said the compulsion took over her life in 2014 and ruined her relationship.

Her addiction meant she was constantly asking her partner for sex.

""It was literally the first thing I thought about when I woke up, I just couldn't get it off my mind,"" said the 37-year-old, originally from Tadcaster in North Yorkshire.

""I felt like everything reminded me of it. I think it was linked to my depression and the lack of serotonin. I felt like my whole body was craving it.

""It was giving me the instant hit and five minutes later I wanted it again.

""I became a hermit, I stayed at home because I felt ashamed that it was all I could think about. Even though no-one could read my mind, it still felt very uncomfortable for me to be around other people.""

Image copyright Rebecca Barker Image caption Ms Barker split with her partner and made lifestyle changes in a bid to control her addiction

Ms Barker's addiction caused serious problems in her relationship. Though her partner enjoyed the attention at first, it became insurmountable for the couple.

""At first he was fine with it but towards the end he couldn't understand it at all. After a few months he started to raise questions about why and where it was coming from.

""He accused me of having an affair - he thought I must have been feeling guilty about it and that's why I wanted sex with him.""

In November 2014, Ms Barker ""needed a break"" from the relationship and went to stay with her mother.

""When I left, I told my partner I needed to get better. He let me go, then the relationship broke down very quickly after that.

""I was under the care of a psychiatrist at the time - she kept saying she would alter my medication but she never said there were any support groups or anything.""

Ms Barker was diagnosed with depression in 2012 after the birth of her third child. She said after it intensified in 2014 she changed jobs, split up with her partner and moved to France.

""I made many lifestyle changes in order to get over the depression and the addiction and for me that has worked,"" she said.

What is sex addiction?

Image copyright Getty Images

Relate defines sexual addiction as any sexual activity that feels ""out of control"" .

The Association for the Treatment of Sex Addiction and Compulsivity says its number of sex therapists has doubled in the past five years to 170

A questionnaire completed by 21,058 people since 2013 on the Sex Addiction Help website revealed 91% of those seeking help for sex addiction were male

The largest age group of 31% was aged 26-35, 1% were under 16 and 8% over 55

The World Health Organization is expected to approve the inclusion of ""compulsive sexual behaviour disorder"" in its International Classification of Diseases (ICD) list in May 2019

The NHS says experts disagree about whether it is possible to become addicted to sex and points to Relate for further help

Graham, whose name has been changed to protect his identity, said his compulsion led him to cheat on his wife with ""hundreds"" of sex workers, leaving him with ""rip-roaring guilt"".

""When you are in full-blown addiction you are obsessed with thinking about it - from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep.

""It was a horrible, gross experience - there is nothing sexy about it. When you wake up in the morning with a dose of chlamydia, it is not sexy.

""It is damaging and life-destroying.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Graham said when his wife found out he was relieved

Graham, who is in his 60s, estimates he paid hundreds of pounds a month for sex over several years, even building relationships with some of the sex workers he saw.

""What started with one affair at work led to another - but unlike most office affairs which may stem from one partner being unhappily married, mine was an addiction which I had to feed each day.

""You have one affair and then you want another and another one.

""I soon realised that the quickest and most convenient way for me to feed my addiction was to pay for it. I would be seeing escorts, sex workers, three or four times per week.

""It is just like being an alcoholic, it's a cycle that builds up in your mind - you feel a high from thinking about how it might happen and then you act it out in the way you planned.

""Then when it's over you feel remorseful, you say you're never going to do it again.""

Graham stopped leading his ""horrendous double life"" when his wife found an email and confronted him.

He sought help from Sex Addicts Anonymous (SAA), which has 78 self-help groups around the UK, and said he has abstained from extra-marital sex for several years.

""When I was found out, I remember feeling 'thank God - something might change'.

""I went to SAA which is an abstinence-based treatment. I call it going from shame to grace.

""It is such a relief to go to the meetings and find out there are other people who are just as miserable and sordid as you are.

""For people who are in this situation, I just want them to know that there is a way out and you can break the cycle.""

Peter Saddington, from Relate, said there is some therapy and group work available for sex addicts, but most of it is private.

""[Addicts] realise it is causing harm, but they can't stop and they recognise they need help in changing it.

""For alcoholics, there is Alcoholics Anonymous, but they can also go to the NHS [which] provides support for people who have alcohol or drug problems.

""It would be appropriate that [sex addicts] can go to their GP and get support because it has a crippling effect both on them, on relationships, on their families, their financial situation and their mental health.""

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""People who think they may have a sex addiction can seek advice and help via NHS Choices, which includes contacts at Relate, Sexaholics Anonymous, SAA and ATSAC.""

He sought help from Sex Addicts Anonymous (SAA), which has 78 self-help groups around the UK, and said he has abstained from extra-marital sex for several years.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-england-43921760,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6429/production/_101114652_rebec.jpg
Eight unhelpful things to say to an alcoholic,"Exclusive music news, big interviews, entertainment, social media trends and video from the news people at BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra.","['Interviews Hannah Moore', 'Declan Harvey']",None,"It's painful to see someone you love struggle with alcohol addiction.

And it's easy to get angry about how their behaviour is affecting the people around them.

But if you want to help, you need to know the right things to say.

Newsbeat asked three recovering alcoholics to explain what didn't help them, and what they wish their families had said.

1. Why do you need to drink?

""At first I'd say, 'Because I like it,'"" Tracey says.

Her husband had just left the family and she thought alcohol was helping her numb the pain.

But when her children asked her why she was drinking, she became resentful.

She says as a result she even increased the amount she was drinking.

""They were trying to be helpful but to me they weren't because I was in denial.""

But as time went on, she became scared of the addiction.

""I got more open because I was frightened, and I could say, 'I don't know how to stop any more. I need help.'""

She says it's important to try to understand the reasons behind someone's drinking problem, and try not to be judgemental.

2. Why can't you just stop?

Alcoholics can be physically addicted, meaning their body has come to rely on alcohol to feel ""normal"".

Stopping suddenly can lead to withdrawal symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations and seizures.

""I just couldn't stop. Not at the time. Medically I couldn't,"" says Tracey.

""You can go into fits if you stop just like that.""

She was drinking a bottle of vodka a night and would have panic attacks if there was no booze in the house.

""People need to understand it's an illness,"" Tracey insists.

It can take between three months and a year to fully recover from the effects of alcohol withdrawal.

Tracey managed to quit because her family took her to the GP. She spent time in hospital and was put on medication to help.

3. You're selfish

As families grow tired of an alcoholic's drinking, they can often start to criticise them more aggressively.

This made Tracey's behaviour more spiteful, she says.

""I was selfish,"" says Tracey. ""But at the time I couldn't see that.

""It's dreadful to think that's what I used to do. I should have been coming home and thinking, 'What am I going to cook [my daughter] for tea?'

""But all my mind was fixated on was coming home to have a drink.""

Ambrose, who's been off alcohol for nine months, says: ""I could see I was hurting and upsetting people.

""I couldn't cope with feeling guilty so I ended up drinking more to forget that I felt guilty.""

Tracey says it's best to avoid using combative language if you're trying to help someone with an alcohol problem.

Instead, try to be sympathetic.

""I just wanted them to say, 'Look Mum, we know you've got a problem. We're here to help you.'""

4. Don't you love us?

Tracey says her children asked her this often.

""I thought, 'What a horrible thing to say.'

""I knew I did love them. Why would it change because I've had a drink?

""But obviously I wasn't showing them.""

For Rose, who stopped drinking three years ago, it was ""nothing to do with love"".

""If I was able to have stopped of course I would have.

""It wasn't a choice. It was a necessity,"" she says.

5. How are you able to afford this?

""If I had no electricity I'd ask my mum for help to pay for more,"" remembers Rose.

""And sometimes she'd say, 'Oh - but you can afford drink.'

""Unfortunately she was probably right. But it doesn't help.""

6. Shouting and screaming

""Get yourself together"" and ""you're a mother for God's sake.""

Rose remembers these words being shouted at her but she says she only had time to reflect once the shouting stopped.

""There was silence and it gave me room to think.

""Calmly people said to me, 'We're so worried about you. You're going to die. We don't know what to do.'

""I wanted to die in my sleep. I couldn't see how I could ever stop drinking.

""But the silence let me see the pain my family were going through.""

7. We won't drink either

Rose finds it patronising when she goes for dinner with friends and someone says something like, ""none of us are going to drink either"".

""They make a huge deal about them not having alcohol. Actually it makes me feel uncomfortable.

""I'd much rather they said something like, 'Oh, do you mind if I have a drink?'

""When people are being obviously super careful it can be difficult.""

Tracey still goes to the pub with her friends but she says she would never expect them not to drink on her behalf.

8. Are you strong enough?

Since he stopped drinking Ambrose says he dislikes when people ask if he's strong enough to stay off it.

""When they ask that I think, 'Cheers mate, thanks for having faith in me.'""

He understands history may have taught people recovery can occasionally have setbacks but he says: ""It's people having negative thoughts and passing them on to me.

""It puts a negative thought in my head and I start to wonder if I'm kidding myself.""

Lincolnshire Student Life,,[],None,"Some things worth bearing in mind Now, as students you're here to study but of course unless you abstain for whatever reason the pub and alcohol culture is going to play a major part in your student life. University could be your first sloshed, drunk, ratted, bladdered, inebriated - whatever you want to call it - experience. It could also be the first time you find yourself waking up covered in Marmite (believe me this has happened - although not to me I hasten to add). The main thing to remember is that although you may feel clever drinking alcohol the next day you could feel pretty stupid. Alcohol is great as a social way of getting to know people but be careful you don't up your tolerance level too much. Basically like any drug the more you drink the more you need to get drunk. *WARNING*WARNING*WARNING*WARNING* Frequently drinking can seriously affect your health, causing memory loss and cirrhosis (liver damage). (Am I sounding old saying all this - for some reason I keep thinking of - pot, kettle, black). Calories and weight gain are actually terrible side effects. They're not called 'beer guts' for nothing, and a lot of your work on your BG can be achieved at uni/college if you don't keep yourself fit and healthy in other ways (Wait - I know what you're thinking - and we'll get onto alcoholic sex in a minute). Government guidelines advise safe limits of 3-4 units per day for men and 2-3 for women (half a pint of normal lager or a single whiskey is 1 unit). However, these are only guidelines and do not reflect the drinking habits of young people, especially students. Advice Abstaining from drinking is the only way to not suffer from any drink related side effects, but although sensible it is not realistic for many. Apart from heart disease, weight gain, and unprotected sex through alcohol the worst side effect is probably a hangover. This is your body's reaction to the drink you had the night before. Common symptoms include headaches (caused by dehydration) lack of proper sleep and an unsettled stomach. Preventing dehydration will go a long way to staving off the effects of a hangover, so drink as much water possible. I've usually found a pint at least, with another pint next to the bed is a good measure. Eating light food helps to replenish your body's levels of sugar and salt. Avoid tea and coffee as they tend to dehydrate you, and get plenty of vitamin C - try fresh orange juice. Now you'll probably not be operating at your best for the day so keep an eye on those deadlines - nothing worse than forgetting you had to hand in the essay, concentrate on the 9am lecture and still try and catch his/her eye after the lecture to ask them for a drink that very evening. All this whilst still smelling of Marmite - because you got up too late for a shower (believe me, it did happen). Don't mix too many drinks - whoa that's very bad - Oh yes, you'll be clever whilst you're having them but you'll feel very stupid the next day - give yourself a regular de-tox, to give your liver a break from alcohol for a few days. It will stop you getting bored of drinking and going out and building up the kind of Rasputin - style immunity that will require you to drink a litre of vodka before you go out. After a heavy session remember that you still have alcohol in your system. Many motorists have been convicted of drink-driving when breathalysed the day after a night out. Facts You're more likely to have unprotected sex if you're drunk, and legally, consenting to sex while drunk is still consent. You're four times more likely to have an accident on a bike or in a car if you've had a drink. Each pint of beer contains c.180 calories so watch out for that beer gut. One unit of alcohol =



Half a pint of beer

A glass of wine

A shot of spirits



The reasonable intake for an adult female per week is 14 units. The reasonable intake for an adult male per week is 21 units. It takes approximately one hour to get rid of each unit you drink. Help

Both the Student's Union and the University have an alcohol policy to provide support for students and staff who seek help with alcohol related problems.

LYDIA

I THINK THAT YOU ARE VERY STRONG. Rod

Control is the most important thing! With me, I try to place my limits...I know what not to drink...I stick to beer which is not as damaging as the rest....cheers Kevin

Well done Lani for showing how damaging drink can be. A good insight into the drink cycle. You can be treated at some very good clinics free to all,if you feel your drinking is out of control. Ian

This makes me think twice about some of my friends I see out every weekend. I don't think we really understand how serious being drunk every weekend can be. Andy

I can relate to what you are saying 100%....I recently almost dropped out of college due to drink. I stop for a while then go back to it. I wish you all the best for the future. Kate Bartholomew

Lani chooses to share with us a subject that many would feel ashamed to put into the public arena. Alcoholism is too often associated with older people, and we forget that people of Lani's age suffer from it too. She shows a lot of emotion, particularly when talking about her parents, who appear to be a huge concern for her. Along with a goal of returning to university, her parents may be her aid in battling this illness. Jessica

Thank u for the warnings. I hope things work out for u. Don't give up hope. Graeme

How brave are you ? Well done and please know you inspire me. I know of my problems and I know I can't deal with them yet, allthough I know I must! It has been at least a 14 year battle, since I was married anyway and I have drank since 16 yrs old! My marriage has broken and I have 2 children as well, it is the worst Christmas and general time ever! David Mahon

I hope your doing well, a really truthful and thoughtful video. Karrie - San Jose California.

Lani, You are far more wonderful than even you know. I know when you did this video how hard that was for you to do. I understand that you're motive was to help other people. I wanted you to know that the things you lost (college/University) are still there. I can promise you, as a Mom myself, that you will never lose your Mom and Dad. I just have so much respect for you. Angela

Thanks. How brave you are. In the future society will be condemned for its lack of understanding of the medical condition. Until we all understand that Alcoholism is a desease we cannot improve matters Chan Yew Gin

My friend was an alcoholic. He had many friends with him when he was drinking cause he pays for the drinks most of the time. He will drink until late into the night. During this time he forgets his wife, children and home. He owns a Mercedes but he need not have to drive his car. His friends will come and pick him up. Just last year his health deteriorated. He was warned by the doctor to stop drinking immediately. What happened? All his friends deserted him. Most of them did not even visit him when he was warded in hospital for about a month. I call all of them 'FAIR WEATHER FRIENDS' So please beware of such kind of friends. They know you only during drinking session. Get rid of alcohol and you will automatically get rid of these kind of friends. Jade Shaw

Hi, I have had that experience myself. It doesn't do any good and doesn't help at all but at the end I got through it with lots of help from close family & friends. I hope everything goes alright for you and you get through. Good Luck. x David

I am so pleased to see the links to Alcoholics Anonymous. As a health professional, as well as a recovering alcoholic, I am well aware that most health workers involved with Alcoholics ignore AA despite the fact that it seems to be more effective at helping people recover than anything else. Alcohol misuse is an enormous problem which needs to be addressed more sincerely by the government - thank you for highlighting it Mick Knight

Thanks to Lani for this first-hand view of alcohol and alcoholism. I recently attended a seminar in which the speaker, a person experienced in the field of drug and alcohol abuse, said that of all addictions she feared alcohol the most. The majority of drug abusers will eventually kick their habit, but this is not so with alcoholics. Perhaps that's because there isn't the stigma attached to alcohol and it is a legal stimulant? Julia

Thanks for talking about the dangers of alcohol. It is a drug which causes many problems. I hope things work out for you. Renata Macfarlane

Alot of young people don't realise that alcohol is a deadly addictive drug and it's so easy to get it. When you start feeling depressed and you're longing for a drink in order to improve your mood, that is the sign that u r addicted. Watch out! The only way is down from now on. Thanks for this video. People shoud be warned of the danger of alcohol everyday if possible.","['alcohol', 'video', 'alcoholism', 'lani', 'know', 'good', 'drug', 'drink', 'drinking', 'friends', 'health', 'hope', 'brownett']","WATCH THIS VIDEOTo view the video you will need REALPLAYERALCOHOLISMBy Lani BrownettLani originally wanted to talk about cooking but has more serious issues on her mind.

"John McAfee: Addict, coder, runaway","John McAfee speaks to the BBC about his time on the run after his neighbour was found murdered, his addiction to drugs and why he thinks Silicon Valley needs a shake-up.","['Leo Kelion', 'Technology Reporter']",None,"Who is the real John McAfee? He's the man who went on the run after his neighbour was found dead, face-up, with a bullet in his head. He's the man who jump-started the multibillion-dollar anti-virus industry. And now he thinks he can make you invisible on the internet.

Within tech circles he's long been a legend. But for most people, McAfee came to prominence last year when he fled his Central American home - teeth stained, hair dyed, in disguise - rather than let himself be questioned by authorities he accused of being corrupt.

He tells the BBC he had ""no connection whatsoever"" with his neighbour's death. Police say he remains a ""person of interest"".

Back in the US, after posting footage of young female ""friends"" stroking his naked tattooed torso, he now plans to neutralise the NSA's cyber-surveillance system.

It might suggest a crazed, perhaps even deranged, personality. One journalist who has interviewed McAfee many times described him a ""master manipulator"" who lies and deceives.

Image caption John McAfee returned to the US last December after being released from a Guatemalan jail

""I've been called paranoid, schizophrenic, the wild child of Silicon Valley,"" McAfee acknowledges.

But he has a different perspective: ""I'm an entrepreneur. I always have been. I am curious and I enjoy solving problems.

""I think that it's when we step out of the road, step outside the box, become our own person and we walk fearlessly down paths other people wouldn't look at, that true progress comes. And sometimes true beauty as well.

""We're missing that. We're missing the people who have the courage to walk into the wilderness just to see what's there.""

This is how Amy Emshwiller, the teenage ex-prostitute he lived with in Belize, describes him: ""He's sweet, generous. He likes to like adventures. He's serious and usually he has a dark sense of humour. He's generally a sweet guy. He just doesn't like to be [expletive] with.""

So, who is the real John McAfee?

To have any chance of knowing and gaining an informed opinion of what really motivated his erratic-sounding behaviour after the killing of Gregory Faull, you must travel deep into the 68-year-old's past.

Addicted and expelled

Despite his Southern accent, the bleached-blond and goateed businessman is in fact half-British - the son of an Englishwoman who met an American soldier stationed in the UK during World War II.

When she tried to shoot me in the head, what I saw was a frightened child. I'm deaf in one ear now, but I don't have a bullet in my head John McAfee

""I feel as much British as I do American,"" McAfee says. ""There's not much difference between our countries.""

They moved to Virginia when he was young, where he had a troubled childhood. His father was an abusive alcoholic who, when McAfee was aged 15, shot himself dead. In the following years, McAfee says, he too began drinking heavily and taking drugs, but still managed to maintain a promising academic career.

That came to an end in the late 1960s when Northeast State Louisiana State College terminated his PhD in mathematics after it was revealed that he had slept with an undergraduate he was mentoring.

They later married and McAfee turned his skills to a series of programming jobs with some of the biggest tech organisations of the time including Nasa, General Electric, Siemens, Univac and Xerox, all the while continuing to indulge in his addictions.

Image caption John McAfee played up to his bad boy reputation in a video he uploaded in June

""Most of my bosses also used drugs of some kind,"" he says. ""I was in the tech field, after all, we were the leading edge in technology and the leading age in personal experimentation.

""I had to hide it from my mother and sometimes from my wife. But in the work environment - depending on where you worked - in some companies drugs were taken openly at lunchtime in people's offices. It was a bizarre time.""

Image caption McAfee says he has never used anti-virus software

Matters came to a head in the early 1980s after his wife left him, his most recent employer, Omex, let him go and the scale of his drug dependency forced him to seek help.

""It was 1984, the last time that I took drugs, drank alcohol or sold drugs for that matter,"" he says.

""I simply stopped. I started going to an organisation called Alcoholics Anonymous... and that was my last taste of that world.

""However, it is still with me. My body is covered with tattoos from that period. And I'm afraid some of my ideas and concepts and attitudes that were moulded during that time are still with me. That's why people think, perhaps, I'm a little bit off the wall.""

Anti-virus millionaire

Despite his troubles, McAfee managed to land a job at defence contractor Lockheed Martin, where he worked on a classified voice-recognition program.

There he came across an unusual bit of self-replicating code designed to copy itself on to any floppy disk inserted into affected computers. When examined, it contained the message: ""Welcome to the dungeon. Beware of this VIRUS.""

""When I first read about the Pakistani Brain virus, I'd never heard of a virus before, neither had anyone in technology,"" remembers McAfee. ""It fascinated me.""

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption John McAfee speaks to Leo Kelion about his life and why he fled from the police in Belize

He worked out a way to disinfect the computers and then spread the cure via the bulletin board system, a precursor to the web.

The challenge inspired him to set up a business of his own: McAfee Associates - a firm that would later be sold, years after he had left, to Intel for more than $7.6bn (£4.7bn).

""I knew the field would become extremely large because people being who they are, there will always be hackers,"" he says.

""There's always going to be someone who likes you and someone who dislikes you. Someone who thinks you're a hero and some that think you're a villain John McAfee

""It's why we have graffiti on the walls of the inner city. People like to deface things. They like to disrupt things.

""So, given that fact, computer viruses were not going to go away and were only going to get worse. I just did what I could to be at the forefront of that industry for as long as I could.""

Despite this, he says, he has never himself used any of the products made by the firm that continues to bear his name.

""I'm constantly under attack, yet I use no software protection.

""I protect myself by constantly changing my IP [internet protocol] address, by not attaching my name to any device I use, and by not going on to sites where you might pick up a virus.

""Porn sites, for example, I just don't go there.

""Secondly, I practise safe computing. If someone sends me an email with a link, I'm not going there until I can call the person to verify that they sent me the email.

""It sounds absurd to live that way, but I would rather trust my own devices and thoughts than someone else's software.""

After selling his stake in the business in 1994, McAfee went on to found and sell other companies, including an instant messaging system, a firewall provider and a ranch from which he offered flights in ""trikes"" - low-flying, engine-powered cabins suspended from hang-gliders.

Then he headed south.

Research and raid

In 2008, at an age others might be thinking of putting up their feet, McAfee moved to the jungle of Belize with the stated intention of trying to cure another kind of infection.

""I came across a concept called quorum sensing, which is the technique that bacteria use to communicate with each other.

""Up until about 10 years ago we didn't even know that bacteria did communicate, but we find out they have a very sophisticated communication system. I wanted to explore and investigate that to see if we could come up with new antibiotics.""

He picked the area, he says, because the plants that grew along the country's Rio Nuevo river contained compounds that inhibit bacteria from sending chemical signals to each other and thus thwart their ability to co-ordinate an attack.

Things didn't go as planned.

The first sign of trouble was when journalists invited to his Carmelita, Orange Walk, base wrote stories that made clear they did not know what to make of the operation.

Then a falling-out with the microbiologist he was working with, Allison Adonizio, put the project at risk when she quit.

Dr Adonizio, who is now based in Philadelphia, did not want to be interviewed.

In April 2012, matters came to a head when the Belize police force's Gang Suppression Unit raided the research facility.

McAfee says the officers claimed they suspected it was being used to make the illegal psycho-stimulant methamphetamine.

They shot his dog, he says, confiscated both his passport and licensed weapons on the property, and briefly imprisoned him before dropping the charges.

""Under no circumstances did they really believe it was a meth lab,"" he states.

""Everybody knew it was a biotech lab because I had hired half of the people in the village to work there. They all knew what I was doing.

Image caption McAfee's Quorumex project attempted to create new treatments using plants from Belize's jungles

""It's a pirate haven. It's an extremely corrupt and dangerous place.

""I knew this and my friends all advised me against it. I just thought I was smart enough to sidestep it. Unfortunately, I was not.

""I was there for a year and the local politician sent a representative and asked for $2m for a campaign donation. I said no. Two weeks later they raided my compound.""

McAfee says when he was asked a second time for the cash he went on a publicity blitz, posting messages online, and speaking to local and international press about the incident. It became political.

The Belize Times - published by the leading opposition party - suggested the ""barbaric assault"" on McAfee was a ""global black eye"" for the nation and a threat to its tourist industry.

""I do wish that I were smarter socially,"" reflects McAfee.

""I think I have the ability to solve mathematical equations and programming issues very easily, but I am a little bit naive in some social situations. And certainly in Belize I was way naive.""

Image caption Amy Emshwiller moved with John McAfee to the Caribbean town of San Pedro

At the time of the raid, McAfee had begun an affair with a 16-year-old ex-prostitute he had met on Belize Independence Day.

""I was partying, I was drinking, and I went into this bar and the owner said a friend wants to meet me and likes me,"" remembers Amy Emshwiller, who still lives in Belize.

""[He said] can I have your number, and then two weeks later he called me.""

She says he was unaware she was less than a quarter of his age.

""He didn't know how old I was. I lied to him saying I was 18, and he thought it was OK.

I didn't quite realise that his lifestyle would be this older guy surrounded by young girls and bodyguards with guns Chad Essley, Graphic novelist

""I let him fall in love first before I told him my age.

""When I told him he was so [expletive] shocked that he didn't know what to do. He was baffled. And he was like: 'I still love you, I don't know what to do. I'm in love with a young girl.' That's how that happened.""

McAfee's long-term American girlfriend left him. And like many things in his life, the new affair proved complicated.

One night Emshwiller took McAfee's gun. She aimed it at his head, squeezed her eyes shut and pulled the trigger. She missed.

He continued the relationship.

""Amy, for one - and many girls in Belize - has a horrific story of abuse that if I told you, you could not believe it,"" McAfee explains.

""Of course she's not going to be well. Of course she's going to have issues.

""When she tried to shoot me in the head what I saw was a frightened child.

Image caption After the raid on his Carmelita property, McAfee moved to San Pedro on Ambergris Caye island

""What I saw was a confused girl who had been so abused - physically, sexually, emotionally - beyond any description.

""What are you going to do? Throw her out? That doesn't help her.

""All she did was burst my eardrum. I'm deaf in one ear now, but I don't have a bullet in my head. Forgiveness is one of the graces that we have as human beings. Can I be faulted for indulging in it?""

Emshwiller confirms the event but says she wanted to scare, not kill, him after he had said he wanted another girl. She adds it was not the only such incident provoked by her jealousy.

""One time before, I held him in the corner and I put a knife at his throat,"" she says.

""And he just said: 'Go ahead. Kill me.' And I couldn't do it. I just dropped the knife and walked out.""

Image caption Cartoonist Chad Essley is working on a graphic novel about McAfee which is due for release next year

Following the raid, McAfee and Emshwiller moved to his villa at San Pedro - a town on Belize's biggest island, Ambergris Caye - where they agreed to have an open relationship.

There they were visited by Chad Essley, a cartoonist, who began collaborating on a book about McAfee's life.

""I didn't quite realise that his lifestyle would be this older guy surrounded by young girls and bodyguards with guns,"" he says.

""Many of these girls were former prostitutes or had very rough lives.

""It was expressly forbidden to go out in the town and drink - the smell of alcohol, he could not be around it. He didn't want any of the girls doing any drugs at all.

""I interviewed each of these girls, got their background. They were incredibly sad. They were definitely in a better sort of situation being around John.""

Meanwhile next door, Gregory Faull, an Orlando sports bar owner who had recently divorced and decided to live in his Belize holiday home, was becoming increasingly irate at his neighbour's activities.

'Hatchet buried'

On Thursday, 8 November 2012, McAfee made the local headlines when he donated 40 stun guns, handcuffs and batons to the local police at a press conference.

Mayor Daniel Guerrero thanked him, stating: ""Crime is affecting the tourism industry as we have been listed on travel advisories; it is time to stop this. Let us protect our industry and turn San Pedro into the safe haven once more.""

That night the local TV bulletin declared that ""the hatchet was formally buried"", suggesting the rift between McAfee and Belize's authorities had ended.

Early on Sunday morning, Mr Faull was found dead in a pool of his blood by his housekeeper. Police called to the scene found a single 9mm shell nearby. They said a mobile phone and laptop were missing but there were no visible signs of a forced entry.

Image caption Gregory Faull was found shot dead at his home in Belize

The head of the police's Gang Suppression Unit told a local newspaper that his officers wanted to speak to McAfee as part of the investigation, but when they called at his house he did not appear to be in.

An article posted the following day by Wired magazine revealed why.

McAfee told the publication he had seen the officers approaching and had hidden in the sand of his property putting a cardboard box over his head.

He recalls that his caretaker had told him of Mr Faull's murder, and now he feared for his own life.

""The first thing that came to my mind was, 'Oh, my Lord. The government is finally trying to rid themselves of me,' he says.

""The government does from time to time.

""I had certainly been a huge thorn in their side, and they had simply got the wrong white man.

""Seriously, this is what went through my mind. My friends sort of calmed me down, and later said that's absurd. At the time I did not think so.""

McAfee acknowledges that he and Mr Faull had been at odds, but plays down the idea they hated each other or that he suspected him of being the person who had fed two of Emshwiller's dogs a poisoned tortilla.

""The entire five years I was there, I'd said maybe 15 words to him,"" he says.

""He did not like my dogs and the past two occasions I had seen him walking on the beach he complained. But so did everybody.

""There was no ongoing argument. Yeah, he was mad about my dogs. Maybe as I'm beginning to think now, maybe he was the one who poisoned them. At the time I certainly did not believe that.""

Image caption John McAfee dyed his hair black as part of one of his disguises

In fact, as ABC News later revealed, Mr Faull had filed a complaint to Mayor Guerrero about McAfee the previous month.

It said McAfee's dog had attacked a tourist; that his security guards had ""terrified"" other residents by walking around with shotguns and shining lights in their eyes, and that taxis and other traffic had been arriving at his property ""at all hours"", causing a disturbance.

""I did not find that out until weeks after I came back to the States,"" says McAfee when pressed about this.

""Belize is not like America where you file a complaint and then the police come out and chase things out. You file a complaint and it goes into a drawer.""

Hiding out

McAfee then went on the run, saying he feared he would be ""silenced"" if he was caught and thrown in jail.

It made headlines worldwide, in no small part due to the fact that he was posting updates to a blog and giving frequent interviews - actions he says were designed to ensure he couldn't be made to disappear if he had been caught.

Image caption Prime Minister Dean Barrow said it was ""utter and complete nonsense"" that the police wanted to kill McAfee

""I disguised myself as a ragged salesman,"" he recalls.

""All it takes is some dirty clothes and not bathing for a few days and not combing my hair.

""You know, people saw my photograph everywhere because all of the police and army had it for that month and a half I was underground. I just made sure I looked different than that.""

Questioned about the affair, Dean Barrow, Belize's prime minister, made it clear McAfee was not an official murder suspect, and had only been classed instead a ""person of interest"".

""I don't want to be unkind to the gentleman, but I believe he is extremely paranoid, even bonkers,"" the politician added.

Belize and corruption The BBC put Mr McAfee's claims of corruption to the Belize government, which is currently embroiled in a scandal involving the issue of a passport to a South Korean man who had never visited the country. It sent this reply: Belize has made great strides in improving transparency and ethical behaviour across all government departments. Where any sniff of corruption and evidence of such has been proven, the prime minister and the government have moved swiftly to stamp it out. This has most recently been demonstrated by the sacking of the junior minister of immigration. The US government and the Commonwealth have been instrumental in supporting Belize in addressing governance issues as we work to reduce even the appearance of fraud and corruption. Corruption is a cancer that Belize will continue to correct - it has no place in government or in any public office and we do not and will not tolerate it. The past is the past and this Belize government cannot change the behaviour of previous administrations or officials, but the prime minister has vowed to root out corruption wherever and whenever it occurs.

During this time McAfee continued to see Emshwiller.

""When he was on the run I went for lunches with him and then he would call and say: 'Come to this place, or go there,' she recalls.

""How to come, when to come. Not to go out, or stay home, or go to a different location. He would tell me that so nobody would get me.""

She adds that she regrets she did not go with him when he finally decided to escape the country.

The next major development came on 3 December when a reporter and photographer from Vice magazine revealed they were documenting McAfee's life on the run.

In what proved a frustrating twist for the tech guru, they then unwittingly revealed he had crossed the border to Guatemala - a fact revealed by a photo uploaded to the Vice website by staff at its headquarters, who failed to wipe its location data.

""I had gone out of my way to arrange the escape and I was breathing easily and looking forward to a few days of relaxation,"" remembers McAfee.

""We immediately had to go on the run again because we were in Guatemala illegally at this point. But it was no-one's real fault. It was just the fault of the moment.""

A few days later McAfee was arrested. There was initially speculation he would be sent back to Belize, but a week later he was allowed to fly to Miami a free man.

""After it was over I asked myself, 'Good Lord, I must have been afraid,'"" he says.

""But I really can't remember. I remember merely trying to solve the problems that occurred as they occurred.""

Hero and villain

McAfee has offered a $25,000 bounty for information relating to Mr Faull's death, but says an attempt to contact the victim's family proved unsuccessful.

The family has called the reward a ""hollow gesture"" and suggested if McAfee really wanted to help he would have met with the Belize police.

Image caption John McAfee continued to give interviews even when being held by the Guatemalan authorities

A spokesman for the country's government said its authorities still wanted to speak to the businessman.

""Mr McAfee's claims and his behaviour have been extreme,"" he told the BBC.

""The investigation is ongoing and McAfee remains a person of interest. If McAfee were to respond to questioning it would make a difference to the progress of the investigation - but this is currently out of the hands of the government of Belize.""

So long as the crime remains unsolved, it is inevitable the entrepreneur will always face suspicion. But he says he can live with that.

""There's always going to be someone who likes you and someone who dislikes you,"" he says.

""Someone who thinks you're a hero and some that think you're a villain. You know I just do what I can in situations like this to continue to state that I'm totally innocent.""

That doesn't mean he is trying to forget his time in Belize.

In addition to the graphic novel, he is working with a Canadian firm to make both a documentary and a movie about his time there.

He adds that George Jung - the imprisoned cocaine drugs lord portrayed by Johnny Depp in the film Blow - has been picked to write his biography.

While those projects brew, McAfee has returned to Silicon Valley, announcing the forthcoming launch of a $100 gadget that he promises can make you invisible on the net.

""If you cannot see it, you cannot hack it, you cannot look at it, you cannot spy on anything happening inside it,"" he explains.

He says the D-Central units will fit in people's pockets and allow their phones, tablets and PCs to communicate with other owners' devices within a three-block radius.

Image caption John McAfee is working with a Canadian company to make a documentary about his life

He adds they can also connect to the net anonymously via a node - a separate piece of equipment attached to the network - either directly or with their encrypted data relayed relayed via other D-Central boxes.

Each will frequently change their network identifier - a long number used by devices as an ID - making them hard to track, he explains.

He suggests it will appeal to college students who want to copy music anonymously and to businesses wanting to prevent the theft of corporate secrets.

He's also well aware that in the light of Edward Snowden's leaks about surveillance techniques used by the US and UK governments, part of the appeal will be thwarting their efforts.

""You know from their own paranoia and desire to stay in power, they are watching everything they can,"" he says.

Will the tech work? Will he really frustrate the authorities once again?

At this point, like so much of John McAfee's life, it's impossible to be sure of all the facts and it's ultimately up to you whether you take him at his word.","['addict', 'belize', 'mcafees', 'john', 'caption', 'mcafee', 'coder', 'im', 'came', 'going', 'later', 'head', 'runaway']","Who is the real John McAfee?

Bournemouth's underage drinkers,"A report indicates the number of young people needing help with drink-related illnesses is on the rise in Bournemouth, but why are the figures for the town so high, and how can underage drinkers be helped?",[],7/9/2008 0:00,"The number of under-18s seeking treatment as a result of drinking alcohol is on the increase in Bournemouth.

A report by Bournemouth and Poole Primary Care Trust indicates that worrying numbers of teenagers are needing treatment for complications resulting from alcohol abuse.

Help playing audio/video

The figures show that 142 under 18-year-olds were admitted to the Royal Bournemouth Hospital with problems related to alcohol over the past two years, the youngest being only three years old.

The figures are 34% higher the national average, and one reason could be because of Bournemouth's large number of 24-hour licenses, suggests Alison Rogers, chief executive of the Ringwood-based British Liver Trust.

Bournemouth has around 52 24 hour licenses She says: ""[The figures] are shocking but not entirely surprising.

""Bournemouth's opted to go for a high density of 24 hour licenses, I think there are 52. Southampton has taken the opposite approach and only allowed one or two, so I don't think we can be surprised there's a correlation between these figures.""

Nationwide, a third of 14-year-olds and half of 15-year-olds drink alcohol on a weekly basis.

And over 1,000 children under 13 need emergency treatment for alcohol poisoning every year.

Seeking help

Chris and Chrissy are two young Bournemouth teenagers who have had problems with alcohol.

The figures in Bournemouth are higher than average Chrissy first started drinking when she was 15. She would go down to the beach and then when she woke up the next day she wouldn't remember anything of her previous night.

She says: ""I had lots of problems and drinking took everything away.""

Chris started drinking at 11 and found it led him into trouble with the police, but now both Chris and Chrissy are getting the help they need.

Specialist agencies

A starting point for help is the town's youth service team. Geraint Griffiths is an Area Team Leader. He says:

""We have a detached youth work team who go out on the streets and meet up with people who may be drinking, and they will encourage them to get involved with more positive activities instead of the drinking and be able to refer them to other specialist agencies who can help them.""

PC Dave Fish agrees. Part of the Licensing Team for the town, he says the police can deal with the crime and disorder consequences of underage drinking, but he says the solution to the problem lies with a co-operative 'multi-agency' approach - the police, the PCT, the council, the licensees, the retailers - all working together.

My Zinc Bed press pack: David Hare,Press Packs,[],None,"My Zinc Bed: a compelling adaptation of David Hare's acclaimed play for BBC Two

Interview with David Hare, writer, My Zinc Bed



What would you say are the central themes of My Zinc Bed?

My Zinc Bed is really a study about the arguments about alcoholism. I suppose I knew a lot of friends who were in AA [Alcoholics Anonymous], and because of that I was interested in those arguments about whether alcoholism is a genetically inherited condition that you can do nothing about, and in which you have to surrender your will and treat it as one would treat any other disease – and the argument of AA of rational recovery. AA is an organisation that believes that only by mastering your addiction by willpower can you live a fulfilled life. This seemed to me an extraordinarily interesting argument and that's what I wanted to write about.

I was also interested in the question of why addiction is such a contemporary subject. We hear about it all the time now – be it addiction to shopping, dieting, alcohol, drugs, work – it seems very much to have replaced belief. Addiction has taken the place of ideology. When I was young people discussed what they believed and what their ideas were – those ideas were the ideas which shaped their lives. Now young people discuss the things to which they are addicted. So the whole subject of addiction seems to me quite contemporary and near the bone.

How did the television version of the play come about?

It's often said of my stage writing that it's filmic – a series of fast-moving scenes that are physically realised – and when we did the play at the Royal Court Theatre in 2000 it seemed obviously filmic.

At the time that I wrote the stage play it was very much the cusp of the internet, and the arrival of all that new cyber business – but that stuff over the years seemed rather too dated. So there was a way of looking at it a few years later – to focus on the basic fable, about whether you can ever be in control of your own recovery, indeed whether anybody can really be in control of their own life, that seemed to become much stronger.

It was actually my agent Jenne Casarotto who proposed to HBO the idea that it was time to try and regenerate the single film a little on TV again, and that maybe some plays from the theatre could be adapted once more for television. There's a quite extraordinary experiment going on at the moment in France whereby a major television channel regularly transmits plays live from Paris theatres, and contrary to all conventional modern broadcasting thinking they're getting huge audiences and massive success with these transmissions. This is a small-scale experiment I suppose, to try and get some individual films specially made on the BBC.

It's nice to remind people that it's possible to do interesting things, and particularly if you've got very very good actors like Jonathan Pryce, Uma Thurman, Paddy Considine. You know Uma Thurman doesn't do many television plays – she's doing it obviously because she thinks there's something interesting about it.

How did you go about adapting your stage play for the screen, were there any particular challenges involved?

It was incredibly easy, and it's very rare that you say that! I normally hate adapting my plays for the cinema, and I've done a few adaptations of my plays for cinema. By and large I refuse to do them, mostly because I find it very difficult to reconceive things for new medium. But this has a very strong story about how a rather indigent poet gets picked up by a couple of rich people and spends a summer with them, and then gets passed aside by them. Films adapt more easily when they're like short stories, and in a way it took me back to the plays that I used to write for television in the Seventies like Licking Hitler and Dreams of Leaving, which were very much like short stories, novellas almost – and that's a beautiful form for television.

Can you describe the three characters?

Victor is an entrepreneur who is an ex-communist. Like a lot of people of that hippy generation he then became a businessman and swung all the way from the left-wing ideas of his youth to playing at capitalism with immense success. So he's someone who both has a philosophical hold on capitalism but also is a player within the system. He's picked up, if you like, by capitalism, made rich, then stripped of his money in the course of the drama.

Victor's wife, Uma Thurman's character Elsa, is an alcoholic who is trying to recover through rational recovery. The young poet Paul, played by Paddy Considine, is an alcoholic who is trying to do it the other way, through AA.

Victor claims to be the only person who isn't an alcoholic in the film but by his behaviour you might think he's as much an alcoholic as Elsa and Paul are.

What research did you do for the original play?

I went to some AA meetings, I a read a lot of the stuff about it. AA meetings are very welcoming and open. I know when the play happened at the Royal Court it was much discussed by AA meetings – a lot of people at meetings in London were saying 'have you seen this play, it's really interesting because it's a philosophical discussion of what our problems are and what the problem of addiction is'. So it came out of that. I did do a lot of research but truthfully it was more through watching the agonies of some friends of mine.

Were you involved in the casting process at all?

Jonathan Pryce was sort of self-selecting! He's always been one of the foremost actors of my generation. I first worked with him in 1973, and he's just an exceptional film actor – you can't imagine anybody better to play the role.

Paddy I didn't know at all, he came to the film, as he put it, never having had to speak long lines before. He'd always appeared in films where he was required to be violent, or moody, and has created a really extraordinary body of work. With my plays there is always a sense immediately whether the actor can say the dialogue or not because I write a certain kind of dialogue that is quite technically demanding and is not naturalistic. Paddy took to that like a fish to water, and I think surprised himself by the ease with which he could play the role – mainly because he'd never been asked to play that kind of part before. He's a writer as well so therefore was a wonderful person to play a poet.

Uma I've known since she was 18 or 19, I first saw her work when she began a film about Dylan Thomas in the late Eighties. We've always known she was a very good actress but again she might say she hasn't always been required to show that side of her.

How my famous jockey dad died from 'alcoholism',"Exclusive music news, big interviews, entertainment, social media trends and video from the news people at BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra.",[],None,"Natasha Eddery-Dunsdon says she knew deep down all her life that her dad liked to drink.

But, it wasn't until she was a teenager that she realised how bad it was and that ultimately, he'd choose alcohol over his family.

""He loved all of us and I know that. I really do believe that he wanted to get better,"" she told Newsbeat.

""But there was nothing he could really do in the end and it did control him.""

Her dad, Pat Eddery, was an 11-time champion jockey. He died on Tuesday at the age of 63.

""Filled with grief that my dad is no longer here,"" wrote Natasha in an Instagram post at the time.

Speaking to Newsbeat, the 30-year-old reveals how she and her older sister Nicola knew that, even though their dad was trying to get help, the disease had a grip on him.

In 2010 her dad went into rehab for the second time but it didn't work out.

I can't be a part of your life if you're going to choose drink over having your family in your life Natasha

""He was in a rehab facilitation in Ireland and I actually knew two weeks before he came out that he was going to drink again,"" she says.

""I picked him up and he did drink in the airport. I knew that was his choice then, he was going to drink.""

On the surface, her dad was a hugely successful sportsman and the life and soul of any party.

But he was, she says, also a functioning alcoholic.

In the end, Natasha didn't see her dad for several years because she found it too painful.

""As I walked out the house I said 'I can't be a part of your life if you're going to choose drink over having your family in your life,'"" she says.

""I'd been through so much and that was the last straw. He had to make it on his own now and that was his decision.""

Nobody should ever feel ashamed of seeking help Natasha

Natasha was in her final year at university when things got worse for her and her family.

""He was drinking at strange hours and it was becoming more and more apparent that he had a problem,"" she explains.

""I was getting worried about whether I was going to be able to finish uni. Dad was in such a bad way and I didn't know what I was going to do.""

She turned to her university who helped her find a counsellor.

""Nobody should ever feel ashamed of seeking help,"" she says.

Natasha's counsellor became a big part of her life and she says she suddenly felt like she had a big support network.

Deep down he would have loved to have stayed healthy and kept his family Natasha

Natasha wants others who are affected by alcoholism in their family, especially younger people, to seek help.

""There are things like Al-Anon and you can go to meetings for children of alcoholics or parents and brothers and sisters of alcoholics,"" she says.

""Some people might find that uncomfortable but there are people out there to help.""

Natasha also wants to raise awareness of what she describes as a ""horrible disease"".

""The only reason I'm able to talk about this really is because dad was such an amazing man and people respect him and adore him,"" she says.

""I think deep down he would have loved to have stayed healthy and kept his family.

""If there are people out there who are struggling, don't be ashamed or feel any guilt about getting help.

""It's a wonderful thing if you can reach out and ask for it,"" she urges.

9/11: The 73 minutes that changed my life,"Like thousands of others, Artie Van Why saw the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York from the streets below.

What he witnessed in those minutes changed his life profoundly and will, he believes, continue to haunt him until the day he dies.

The moment he walked through the revolving doors of his office building and stepped on to the street on that sunny September morning, Artie Van Why's world shifted a few degrees on its axis.

It was like the Wizard of Oz, stepping into another world

His life from that instant took a different course, propelled by the mayhem that enveloped him that day, events the world later identified by two numbers, nine and 11.

Millions of people watched on television as four hijacked planes crashed in the US, two of them into one famous New York landmark. But Van Why was in the thick of it.

The experience forced him to leave New York, his home for 26 years, and move more than 100 miles west to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, deep in Amish country.

Ten years after the atrocities, sitting in the corner of a humble one-bedroom apartment located above a funeral home, his face is a picture of concentration as he recalls the day's events.

""I remember it was a beautiful day. Whenever I see a really beautiful blue sky, it takes me back to that morning.""

He was working as a clerical assistant at law firm Holland & Knight, and his office was on the 23rd floor of a building separated from the World Trade Center site only by Church Street and the Millennium Hilton hotel. At 08:46, a loud boom shook the building.

A colleague asked if it was thunder, then someone screamed for everyone to get out of the building, because a plane had hit one of the twin towers. Expecting to see a small aircraft sticking out of the famous skyscraper, Van Why took the lift to the ground floor and exited through a revolving door.

""It was like the Wizard of Oz, stepping into another world. It seemed as everything slowed down and it was going frame by frame as if in slow motion.

""All these white paper sheets were covering the ground like snow and coming down. I remember thinking that I'd never seen so much paper.

""I walked a short distance to Church Street where the towers were and that's when I saw the North Tower for the first time. I was dumbstruck. It was hard to comprehend what I was seeing.

""There was a huge black hole, the flames were bright orange and the smoke was billowing out of the tower.""

More people were arriving on the streets, he says, and sirens could be heard in the background. As his recollections become more vivid, the 58-year-old closes his eyes and rocks back and forth in his orange armchair, his right foot tapping the carpet vigorously.

His rented apartment is full of reminders of what he went through. A photo of the World Trade Center is on the fridge, and other photographs featuring the famous Manhattan skyline adorn the living room, like pictures of a deceased member of the family.

Image caption Reminders of the life left behind fill his apartment

One wall is full of framed newspaper cuttings, reviews of the play that Van Why - a former actor - wrote and performed about 9/11. And in front of this shrine, he sits and recalls the minutes that reshaped his life, wild hand gestures making the scene all the more real.

""I don't know how long I was looking at the North Tower, trying to take it all in. I was transfixed. What broke it was when I realised there were other things falling, there were people falling and everyone realised at the same time.

""People started screaming and my reaction was to scream 'No, No, No!' at the thought that people were falling down. And that's when - I don't know why I reacted in this way - but my instinct was to run towards them.

I remember shouting out 'God, save us all!

""I ran to the plaza where they were falling. I didn't have a moment's thought, I just ran towards the tower, thinking 'Can I help these people?' I imagined them laying there and the thought of being able to hold their hand or sit and be with them, comfort them.""

Another man was running with him, and for a moment, the two stopped and stood side by side, taking in the enormity of what they were seeing - human beings jumping to their deaths. Van Why recalls seeing bodies piling up on the ground.

""One of my most vivid memories is looking to my left and I saw this man in a suit falling. Somehow I had thought that if you ever jumped from a high place, you would be dead before you hit the ground.

""But I remember seeing how very much alive he was and I can still see his arms and legs moving as if to brace himself. Fortunately I didn't see him hit.""

Some guards shouted for the two men to come to safety through another World Trade Center Building, number 5. They went down a lift and out of the site on to Church Street, from where Van Why saw the second plane hit the South Tower, only 17 minutes after the first.

Pandemonium broke out. Debris was raining down, he says, as he ran towards Fulton Street, at one point falling to the ground.

""People started to run over the top of me and I thought I was going to be trampled to death but I managed to get up. I remember shouting out 'God, save us all!'""

He recalls an African-American woman tripping and being helped to her feet by a businessman. Then he ran past a large man who was lying face down in the street.

Getting down on his knees, Van Why saw that the man had a serious head injury. He appeared to have been hit by a putty knife that had fallen from one of the buildings and was lying nearby stained with blood.

""Another man stopped and gave me a denim jacket which we put over the open wound and then I remember seeing his watch on the street beside him and I put it in his pants [trouser] pocket. We turned him over and he had a work tag with a name.""

With tears falling and his voice cracking, Van Why goes on: ""My biggest regret is that I didn't look to his tag to see what the name was. I could have found his family and told them that there were people with him.""

An ambulance arrived and it required several people to lift the man on to the stretcher. Van Why stroked his arm and told him he would be fine.

Realising he had left his mobile phone in the office, he began asking strangers if he could borrow one to get the message through to his parents that he was OK. But none of the phones were working, so he went into a cafe and used a telephone there.

When he emerged, he heard a deafening sound. He looked to his left and saw a wall of grey smoke coming towards him. The South Tower was collapsing.

For the second time that morning, he started running. The time was 09:59, 73 minutes after the first plane flew into the North Tower.

By the time he got to his apartment on 43rd Street, after deliberately avoiding the area around the Empire State Building, it was approaching noon. The North Tower had also collapsed, but Van Why had been far enough away to not hear it.

In the days that followed, he slept only fitfully and always with the bedroom light on.

""I was afraid of the dark. It never happened before 9/11. It was a sense of security having that light on.

""For that first week I would wake up early and call my parents first thing. I would be on the phone crying with them. There was a lot of crying that week.

""I was feeling sadness and grief and mourning like I had never felt, similar to losing a loved one. And still an incomprehension, trying to understand what had happened.""

He avoided watching television or reading newspapers because he could not bear to see replays or photos of the planes striking the towers. He had his own images, pictures inside his head, sometimes appearing with a clarity that transported him back to the mayhem.

He discovered that two men who lived in his apartment building were missing and a lawyer at work who was last seen running towards the towers was also presumed dead.

Van Why had done exactly the same and survived. As a recovering alcoholic who had been sober for two years, he already had a therapist, and in the weeks following 9/11 he saw him daily.

Alcoholics Anonymous meetings were also an opportunity to share his feelings with others, but he lived alone and had no partner to provide constant support. Before long he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

Holland & Knight opened makeshift offices at a hotel in Midtown but he did not feel able to go back to work until two or three weeks after the attacks. When he did, it was the first time he had ventured outside his neighbourhood.

A few days later, he rented a car and drove to Maryland, for a 30-year high school reunion. The sight of an aeroplane coming into land caused him to burst into tears. At the event, when he introduced himself by saying: ""I'm from the greatest city in the world, New York City,"" people stood up and applauded.

His old offices near Ground Zero were soon ready again, but Van Why found returning to the scene too harrowing to endure. The smell of smoke from the still-smouldering site would fill his nostrils as he emerged from the subway.

The WTC plaza - once his lunchtime sanctuary - now resembled to him a grave. One morning, the police allowed him to enter the site so he could lay six roses on what he regarded as ""hallowed ground"".

In November 2001, he resigned from work after 13 years of service. It was too painful to continue. He instead focused on his new project - writing his own story about his experience.

I was out of the country and didn't get back to New York City until the end of October. I was in touch with Artie, aware of his proximity, but didn't fully understand the impact on him until I got home. It was unravelling. It could only be unravelling. No-one should have to witness something like that. In survival mode, he knew he no longer could stay in NYC. His family, which had always been a strong connection in his life, would provide a sense of comfort and familiarity he desperately needed. He moved out of the city and regrouped. It took time. Through his grief and pain he also found a creative outlet. He was able to process his grief by writing about it.

He had written emails to family and friends following the attacks, to explain what happened, and they forwarded his story to other people. Soon he began to receive appreciative emails from strangers.

Encouraged, he began to develop his story into a script, convinced it was his mission to keep the memory alive. It became a one-man play that he performed off-Broadway and in Los Angeles.

""The play gave me a sense of purpose. Those two years after 9/11, when I was really focused on my play, that is the only time in my life I felt fulfilled, because I had a purpose and I thought I was doing something important and something selfless, because I was doing it for the memory of the people I saw die.""

After each performance, some people would tell him their own story of where they were, making him realise, he says, that people across the US had a story of 9/11.

He was hoping he could continue performing the show for at least five years.

""I wanted to dedicate my life to it. But it closed in New York earlier than planned, the major papers ignored it and some reviews were critical, saying I was trying to profit out of it.""

It seemed to him like the city was ready to move on and he was not. The spirit that defined New York in the days, weeks and months afterwards had gone, he says, and he felt a bit like a ""lone crusader"".

Image caption Van Why performed his play in 2003

""It still weighed so heavily on my emotions and who I was, so to see other people weren't doing that and moving on, it was like 'How can they be doing that?'

""There was anger and a feeling of isolation. In the month after 9/11, it was all you talked about with strangers, but two years afterwards, there was a sense that 'OK, you don't need to talk about this any more.'""

Immersing himself for years in writing and performing the play probably held him back, he admits, because he was dwelling on the events and re-living them, but not dealing with the emotions.

That process did not begin until he moved. In September 2003, he started a new life in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, because he wanted to be near his parents.

""I never thought I would leave New York, I envisaged my last days would be in New York but it just seemed like the right thing to do.""

He felt guilty about leaving, but the pull of family was overwhelming and he felt like he had nowhere else to go.

""All of a sudden I just needed to be closer to them, I wanted it and needed it. For me and my parents, the reality that 9/11 was a day that I could have died brought the importance of being with my family to me.

""Though I was in my 50s, there was a sense that I needed mummy and daddy, that sense of security and that sense of home.""

Growing up, home was Gaithersburg in Maryland, where the young Van Why was a quiet boy, according to his parents.

Thelma and Art Van Why His parents endured a terrifying few hours on 11 Sept 2001 while they waited for news

Relief at hearing he was OK turned to despair as they watched their son spiral into depression

But in 2003, he moved to be near to them both

""We're so happy that he's moved because we became closer. It's a big change,"" says Thelma. ""But to see your own child go through that, you wonder what you can do to help.""

""He was in his own little shell, his own little world and we would try to comfort him as much as we could,"" says Art. ""We just told him we were here for him. So it's really helped me to know he's starting to come round.""

He says he felt different from other children - he later realised he was gay - and was bullied.

After high school, he attended a small, conservative Christian college, where he majored first in Bible studies, then in drama.

He moved to New York in 1977 with the dream of becoming an actor but after struggling for 10 years to get sustained work in the theatre, he gave it up. The clerical work that had been a supplement to his income became his main and only job.

As a young man, he'd had a difficult relationship with his parents and throughout his adult life he had seen them only three or four times a year. It was not until he moved to Pennsylvania, two years after the attacks, that his relationship with them, in his own words, ""fully healed"".

""I didn't know what it would entail, moving here, but eight years later, my relationship with my parents is incredible. It has a depth and appreciation it has never had before.""

When he arrived in 2003, he didn't have a job, an apartment or a car, and he left many long-standing friendships behind in New York. And there was no-one who could relate to what he had been through.

After the bright lights of Manhattan, the small city of Lancaster - with fewer than 60,000 residents and a homespun, rural charm - struck a tranquil note.

Van Why withdrew socially, spending a lot of time in what he calls his ""cave"", a room where he would just watch television endlessly at weekends. Even when he was coaxed out of his isolation by colleagues for a coffee, he was lost and distracted.

A low period at the end of last year, when he was often breaking down, was his grief finally being released, he believes.

""I was very fortunate I did not lose my physical life but I lost my life as I knew it. The person I was on September 10th, that person is no longer. I had to go through a very emotional period which enabled me to go and face Ground Zero.""

In the last few months he has started to come out of his metaphorical cave. The first step on the road to recovery was going back to New York in April, for the first time since he left in 2003. With his parents and sister Sue by his side, he visited the place that had haunted him for nearly a decade.

""That was a huge step for me. It was very emotional but it helped to put an end to that chapter of my life. Even though I had been away for eight years, there was guilt that I had left my city when it was still healing.""

Only having closed that door, could he start to regard Lancaster as home, he says. Shortly after that trip, he met someone and began a relationship.

""Being with him, I realised that I had forgotten what it was like to be happy. It's like I am stepping back into life. I'm finally moving past mourning.""

But there are other struggles. He has two jobs, one in the box office of the Fulton Theatre in Lancaster, and another as a cashier in a Weis supermarket. The two incomes combined earn him about $20,000 (£12,196) a year, about $50,000 (£30,494) less than he was earning in New York.

'I witnessed the goodness of man' ""I don't believe I had witnessed the wrath of anyone's God that morning. What I had been a witness to when I looked up at those burning towers was the ultimate evil that man is capable of. The evidence of just how deep hatred could run, how far it could go. But I had also been a witness to something else that day - down on the ground. I witnessed the ultimate goodness of man, the evidence of how strong courage could be, to what lengths it would go. I believe God was in the hands of everyone who reached out to someone else. He was in the arms of people on the streets as they embraced one another. He was in the tears of strangers who cried together. He was in all the lives that were given in the line of duty, in the acts of heroism. He was in the hearts of the people across the country who, as they watched the horror from afar, felt compassion."" That Day In September

It's a thorn in his side, he says. ""I have debts and try to pay them off when I can and meet my basic expenses. So far, I've been lucky to just get by.""

If he had been told in 2001 that in 10 years he would be living in Pennsylvania and working in a theatre and a supermarket, he would have been shocked.

""I liked my job. I liked working down there. And, yes, I was making a good salary. I would like to think I might have developed a relationship with someone.

""At the time of 9/11, I was in the best place I had been for a long time - sober and happy. Perhaps I would have been able to take vacations and travel, things I'm unable to do now.""

And the images are still there every day, sometimes popping into his head without warning, with such force that he zones out while his mind revisits the carnage.

""They are like snippets of a movie. I will replay watching this one man who I saw falling, watching him. I will flash to the injured man I saw laying in the streets. It's a series of vignettes that my mind just goes back to.""

A siren is enough to take him back there and it's a sound that makes his body tighten. He still has not boarded a plane, although tall buildings don't instil in him the same fear they once did.

A study by Cornell University suggests that the trauma suffered by witnesses like Van Why may have physically altered their brains, damaging their ability to process emotions.

He says 9/11 survivors and witnesses like himself are the ""forgotten majority"", never considered among the victims.

What I was doing for a long time was letting 9/11 define who I was

""They're not letting any survivors to the [10th anniversary] ceremony in New York, it's just bereaved family members.

""There's a sense that you don't count. Some people are still struggling terribly, far worse than I am. Everyone who was there is still affected to a degree, but people don't remember us.

""We're not suffering physically and weren't injured that day and didn't lose a family member. It's like we don't count.""

Despite the financial and mental strains, he is now looking to the future with a new optimism.

""It's my life now and I've never accepted that before. That's another change in the past months. Not that I was fighting it before, but there's an acceptance, I'm moving out of the mourning stage and back to life again.""

It's comparable to losing a partner, he says, with the memory of that loved one never disappearing but gradually losing its hold.

""I can't imagine a day going by when I don't think about it, even as a passing thought.

""What I was doing for a long time was letting 9/11 define who I was and I think I'm getting away from that now. My experience of 9/11 is part of who I am but not all of me.""

Alcohol and student life,,[],None,"SEE ALSO PRINT THIS PAGE View a printable version of this page.

Alcohol is the most commonly available and socially acceptable form of intoxication.



Although you're here to at least attempt a degree, you'll probably consume alcohol heavily while you're here, Muslims and teetotallers excepted.



For some, University will produce your first pissed encounter, for others, the first time that you end up pissing in your own cupboard and then waking up next to a naked flatmate covered in peanut butter. For most students University is the first time away from home, without the worry of having to act sober in front of parents or getting home late.



Suddenly you have no one to answer to (except the wardens, who may not appreciate your standing naked on a picnic bench, proclaiming that you're Spartacus at 2am. Especially if everyone else joins in.).



It's easy to become dependant on the effects of alcohol. The confident, relaxed state of mind it induces can be addictive and often it can seem an essential for a good night out.



A tolerance can build up if you drink heavily, and increasing amounts are needed to produce the same effects.



Frequently drinking can seriously affect your health, causing memory loss and cirrhosis (liver damage).



It is also one of the main reasons why such a large percentage of students put on weight. Most alcoholic drinks are high in calories - your pint might contain the same number of calories as a Mars bar.



In extreme cases drinking can cause heart disease and even brain damage or stomach ulcers.



More commonly, problems include unsafe sex, accidents or acts of violence.



Government guidelines advise safe limits of 3-4 units per day for men and 2-3 for women (a pint of normal lager or a single whiskey is 1 unit).



However, these are only guidelines and do not reflect the drinking habits of young people, especially students.



Advice

Abstaining from drinking, only to make it up in one binge session is an example of how this advice can be misinterpreted. Of course there is a downside to having the time of your life and drinking yourself into oblivion- the next day.



A hangover is your body's reaction to breaking down the alcohol consumed the day or night before. Common symptoms include headaches (caused by dehydration) lack of proper sleep and an unsettled stomach.



Preventing dehydration will go a long way to staving off the effects of a hangover, so drink as much water possible. Those of you who aren't put to bed should take a glass for your bedside table - you'll know why when you wake up with a mouth like a camel's backside.



Eating light food helps to replenish your body's levels of sugar and salt. Avoid tea and coffee as they tend to dehydrate you, and get plenty of vitamin C - try fresh orange juice.



Your mood will probably quite low, and your stamina and mental activity will be reduced, so try to plan your drinking so you don't disrupt your college commitments- ie use your common sense, don't drink the night before 9am lectures, or if you've got a deadline looming.



Its difficult to avoid mixing your drinks, as the selection increases every year, but don't push it too far if you do. You should also give yourself a regular de-tox, to give your liver a break from alcohol for a few days.



It will stop you getting bored of drinking and going out and building up the kind of Rasputin - style immunity that will require you to drink a litre of vodka before you go out.



After a heavy session remember that you still have alcohol in your system. Many motorists have been convicted of drink-driving when breathalysed the day after a night out.



As long as you pace yourself and keep your head, your days and nights out over the next few years will provide you with memories that will stay with you forever. Facts

You're more likely to have unprotected sex if you're drunk, and legally, consenting to sex while drunk is still consent.



You're four times more likely to have an accident on a bike or in a car if you've had a drink.



Each pint of beer contains c.180 calories so watch out for that beer gut.



One unit of alcohol = Half a pint of beer

A glass of wine

A shot of spirits

The reasonable intake for an adult female per week is 14 units. The reasonable intake for an adult male per week is 21 units.



It takes approximately one hour to get rid of each unit you drink.

Thousands of dangerous drink-drivers are reoffenders,"Almost one in five motorists listed on an official register of the most dangerous drink-drivers has been on it before, the BBC learns through a Freedom of Information request.","['Nicola Beckford', 'Bbc Radio', 'The World At One']",None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Anish Patel, whose wife was killed by a drink driver: ""Something has to be done""

As new figures show the number of people killed in drink-driving crashes rose by 17%, the BBC has discovered that thousands of drink-drivers are repeat offenders.

A fifth of those on a DVLA ""high-risk register"" have been on it before.

There are calls for more stringent checks before offenders are given back their licences.

The government said it had tightened up rules, and drivers now had to prove they were no longer alcohol-dependent.

Drink-drivers who are more than two and a half times over the legal limit, who have two or more drink-drive offences within a 10-year period or who refuse to give breath, blood or urine samples, are classed by the DVLA as ""high-risk offenders"".

Using the Freedom of Information Act, the BBC discovered there are currently 230,149 banned drivers on the DVLA's scheme and of these, 42,207 drivers had been on it before.

Their licences had been returned because they were considered safe to drive when their initial ban expired.

But under rules introduced in June, when a ban expires, offenders can reapply for their licence only when they have passed a medical test to prove they are no longer alcohol-dependent.

However, this will apply only to new offenders - those convicted earlier can drive after reapplying for their driving licence.

Provisional figures released on Thursday show that 280 people were killed in drink-drive accidents in 2012, an increase of about 17% compared with 2011. This accounts for 16% of all road deaths in Britain. Overall, deaths were down 8% on 2011, at 1,754.

Police and road safety campaigners say the system of dealing with drink-drivers needs to be re-examined.

'Bitter experience'

Insp Richard Auty, who has investigated collisions for the Metropolitan Police for 17 years, said he was surprised by the DVLA figure, adding that it was ""quite large"".

He expressed doubts that the new testing system would address the problem.

""I suspect from the people that I've dealt with that whilst it will deal with the worst offenders, the binge drinkers that are able to control it will clearly not turn up to a medical drunk, so it won't effectively deal with those people. So I would suggest a mandatory driving test or extended driving test before you get your licence back would be a much greater deterrent.""

In 2009, Anish Patel's wife, Catriona, 39, was killed by a serial offender while cycling to work. She was crushed under the wheels of his lorry outside Oval tube station in south London.

Image caption The driver of this lorry who killed Catriona Patel had been on a drinking binge the night before. He was jailed for seven years.

The driver had three previous drink-driving convictions, had been disqualified 20 times and had three previous convictions for reckless driving.

Mr Patel said: ""It was just a normal day and a few phone calls later and hours later your whole life gets turned upside down and changed forever. She was my best friend, she was the love of my life, she was my soulmate, we did absolutely everything together.""

He felt angry and bitter when he learned about the driver's previous convictions.

""I just thought the biggest thing that shouldn't have happened that day was him being on the road and driving a 40-tonne tipper truck fully laden through one of the busiest junctions through central London.

""These people obviously are not operating by the same rules of the vast majority of the population operate by and I think that there has to be something done about serial offenders. It is too common an occurrence that people get convicted of drink-driving and they are back on the road either illegal or unfortunately legally. ""

'Get carried away'

Johnny, a former serial drink-driver who stopped drinking through Alcoholics Anonymous, was caught three times in nine weeks.

He was banned for two years and continued to drink-drive for 15 years but was never caught again.

He said: ""I always thought of the consequences but unfortunately just the following morning. I was just going out for one or two drinks, get a bit carried away and invariably I'd end up drink-driving.

""I'm not convinced that a tougher sentence would have made any difference. How much tougher do you want it to be? You're going to lose your liberty, you're going to lose your job, you're going to lose your home. You're going to lose everything basically if you do it again. That never stopped me from driving.""

Amy Aeron-Thomas, executive director of RoadPeace, the national charity for road crash victims, said it was time to review driving bans and increase the number of breathalyser tests.

""There is public support for a five-year ban for first-time offenders. Now you are talking about repeat offenders, big-risk offenders - they deserve lengthy driving bans if not losing their licence permanently.

""We know with the decrease in road policing there are fewer breathalyser tests being given so there is a greater chance of them getting away with it.""

Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: ""Drink-drivers are a menace and it is right that we do everything we can to keep the most high-risk offenders off the road.

""That is why we have tightened up the rules which mean that they now have to take medical tests to prove they are no longer alcohol-dependent before being allowed to drive.""

FA Cup: Ex-Everton midfielder George Green on self-destruction and depression,"He was once compared to Wayne Rooney before a cocaine addiction saw George Green go from a £110,000-a-year midfielder to £80-a-game at Ossett Albion.",[],9/22/2018 19:48,"Everton's George Green, then aged 17, tackles Liverpool's Seyi Ojo in an Under-18 game in November 2013

It is October 2011 and 15-year-old George Green is travelling to London for a trial with Tottenham Hotspur when a phone call changes everything. Everton have agreed a £2m deal with Bradford City for the schoolboy midfielder.

Green signs a two-and-a-half-year contract, receives a £45,000 signing-on fee in three instalments of £15,000, and a promising future with the Toffees beckons for the Dewsbury teenager.

Four years later he is standing on railway tracks near his hometown waiting for the next train so that he can end his life, Green's hopes of making it as a Premier League player ruined by cocaine and alcohol.

""I was in that much debt, I thought I'd lost my partner because of my drug use, and I didn't see a way back for me with football,"" the 22-year-old told BBC Sport.

Now at sixth-tier Chester, who beat City of Liverpool 4-0 in the FA Cup second qualifying round on Saturday, Green opens up about having too much too soon, self-destruction, depression and how he is attempting to rebuild his life.

""Mental health and addiction is an everyday battle. I'm giving it my best shot,"" he says. ""If others can learn from it, I'd rather help.""

'A £2,000-a-month cocaine addiction'

It was Everton Under-21s boss David Unsworth who broke the news to a tearful Green, then aged 19, he was no longer required after a loan at League Two Tranmere Rovers in 2015.

He had arrived at Goodison Park a fresh-faced schoolboy and was quickly compared to Wayne Rooney, who made his senior debut for the club aged 16.

Green left without playing a first-team game having spent five weeks of his four years at Goodison Park in London's Priory hospital, which provides a range of mental health and addictions treatments.

""Everton paid for it all, I think it was about £5,000-a-week,"" said Green, who was playing in the Toffees' U21 side by the age of 16 alongside future England internationals John Stones and Ross Barkley.

""Before I turned 18 you wouldn't catch me out at night. As soon as I was 18 it was like a new world opened up. I was drinking, doing drugs and playing football.

""The first time I took drugs I'd gone to watch football in a pub with mates. I was offered cocaine and it changed my life.""

At first Green was able to hide his habit from the likes of Kevin Sheedy, his youth-team coach, but before long he was taking 30 grams a month and life was spiralling out of control.

""I was spending way over £2,000 a month. I remember one particular Monday morning I was supposed to be training. I didn't wake up until the afternoon.

""The night before I'd gone to a friend's house for drink and drugs. I think that's when alarm bells started ringing at Everton.

""I remember phoning a welfare officer at Everton one night. I was crying and said 'I need help'. Soon after I was admitted to the Priory.""

Drugs and alcohol took a toll on Green. Here he is aged 19 signing for non-league Ossett Albion five months after being released by Everton

'I've earned £500,000 - I've got an iPad to show for it'

Having joined Everton as a £150-a-week schoolboy, Green's earnings reached £110,000-a-year at the Premier League club.

Since leaving three years ago, he has also had spells with Burnley and Oldham Athletic - as well as Viking in Norway's top flight under Englishman Ian Burchnall, now boss at Swedish side Ostersunds.

Green, who has also featured in the Scottish Premiership for Kilmarnock, believes he has earned at least £500,000 playing football.

""I have an iPad to show for it. That's how much of a downfall my life has become because of drugs,"" he added.

""I squandered it all. I'm embarrassed.""

At Everton, the former England youth international did most of his socialising back home in Yorkshire.

""A good night out? I'd easily spend about £1,500. A meal would cost between £200 and £300,"" he said.

""I'd be like 'let's get a bottle of champagne' and then a girl would come and sit next to me and I'd be like 'would you like a bottle of champagne?'

""Earning the money I was, I thought it was never going to end.

""Everybody wanted to know who I was and I was enjoying life. But I never got introduced to people who would keep me on the straight and narrow. They drank or did drugs and I fell into that circle.

""I got a brand new Mercedes-Benz A-Class and did about £4,000 damage to it. That stemmed from drink-driving. I was ridiculous, I used to drink-drive everywhere.""

Before he turned 18 and problems with drink and drugs, Green (centre) was compared to Wayne Rooney

'It wasn't my time to go'

Green had four clubs within 14 months of leaving Everton. Soon after his release from the Toffees, he joined League One Oldham on a two-year deal. He lasted five months before his contract was cancelled by mutual consent in November 2015.

""It was due to drink and drugs, I'd fallen out of love with the game and decided I didn't want to play any more.""

By now, Green was on a downward spiral. He had a drink-driving conviction and, after blowing much of his earnings on alcohol and cocaine, he was struggling financially. In addition, he was suffering from depression.

He did not stay away from football for long.

A week after leaving Oldham, Green had signed for non-league Yorkshire side Ossett Albion for £80-a-game. He had gone from Everton to the eighth tier of English football in less than six months.

It was around this time he first contemplated suicide.

""Leaving Everton hit me hard,"" he said. ""I was stood on a railway track close to Mirfield station near Dewsbury ready for a train to come. I remember it being around eight or nine o'clock at night.

""I hadn't written a note. It was all the pressures of everything in my life. The drugs, the alcohol, my mental health, football wasn't going well, lack of money.

""Then there was an announcement over the speakers that the next train was delayed.

""I thought 'it must be a sign that it can't be my time to go'. I broke down in tears and walked away.""

Green's mental health problems continued. He took an overdose after joining Salford City on loan from Burnley in early 2017.

""I went in the pill cupboard at home and took everything there was. I wanted to die at that time,"" he added.

Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville, Salford's co-owner, offered his support.

Green said: ""I was invited round to his house. I had been in hospital for taking too many tablets. We spoke for an hour about football and things Salford could do to help me.""

Five months clean and a baby on the way

He lives near Dewsbury with his two-year-old daughter Daisy and fiancee, Charli, while the couple are due to welcome a baby boy to the family in October.

Gone are the flash cars and the hangers-on who formed part of his life when he was at Everton.

Instead of a Mercedes-Benz A-Class, Green now drives a Kia Rio to and from Chester, the club he joined in July from National League North rivals Nuneaton.

Money is tight but the player blames no-one but himself.

Green is rebuilding his life with fiancee Charli and two-year-old daughter Daisy

He relapsed in April but says he has not touched drink or drugs since, and attends weekly Alcoholics Anonymous and Cocaine Anonymous meetings.

Green's support network includes former Aston Villa and England defender Gary Charles, a recovering alcoholic who now has a business which provides care to people who are experiencing a wide range of problems, including depression and alcohol/drug dependency.

""There's not a day I don't speak to him. He's a lifesaver,"" adds Green.

'Without football, I'd be dead'

At the time of this interview, Green has an additional battle in his life. Two months after signing, he has yet to make his Chester debut because of a back injury which is likely to require surgery. He's frustrated and impatient.

He has kept himself busy by getting to know Chester fans at home games, signing autographs and posing for pictures.

Chester, a fan-owned club with a community trust, run a weekly mental health and wellbeing session which offers vulnerable members of society a chance to get out and play football.

Green hopes opening up about his problems will raise awareness of mental health and addiction issues.

""Football is the only thing I am good at. Without it I'd be dead,"" he added.

""I thought my career would be over if I came out and started talking about my issues with drugs.

""Then I said to myself 'how about being honest for once in your life and admit your problems'.

""If my story helps one person, I'm happy to tell it. I'm happier, healthier and way more positive than I was.""

Being jailed for glassing woman helped Jan conquer her alcohol demons,'Being jailed for GBH helped me quit booze',"['Alice Gregr', 'Bbc Radio Manchester']",None,"Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption At the height of her addiction, Jan was consuming two bottles of wine each night

BBC Radio Manchester is taking a journey across Greater Manchester's 10 boroughs to meet some of the most inspiring people who live in the region. Here is the latest in the series:

Most recovering alcoholics talk about the moment they hit rock bottom.

Warning signs Image copyright Getty Images In their book Almost Alcoholic, Robert Doyle and Joseph Nowinski identify five signs that someone may be an ""almost alcoholic"": You continue to drink despite at least some negative consequences

You look forward to drinking.

You drink alone.

You sometimes drink in order to control emotional and/or physical symptoms.

You and your loved ones are suffering as a result of your drinking

For Jan, it was when she spent a year in prison for grievous bodily harm after being convicted of glassing a woman in an Alderley Edge bar.

The Stockport mother, who did not want to be identified in order to protect her daughter, says cannot remember anything of the 2008 incident.

At that time Jan was drinking about two bottles of wine a night.

Before then, she says she drank sensibly, in order to wind down from her job as a senior executive for a major oil company.

""I used alcohol as an emotional crutch,"" Jan explained. ""It started off as just a glass of wine after work and it turned into two bottles.

""I'd have cleaned a whole football stadium with a toothbrush if it would tell me why this was happening to me at the age of 40.""

Before being sent to prison she sought treatment for her alcoholism at a private clinic, and was sober when she was behind bars.

While serving her sentence at HMP Styal in Cheshire she helped others who were struggling to cope with life in prison and, as a result, gained a great deal of respect from other inmates.

And since her release she has been helping others battle addiction in Greater Manchester, saying she ""now has a better understanding of herself"".

""And I NEVER think of having a drink.""

Coming up in today's programme: Babies' hips - and concerns that the resurgence of swaddling is leading to hip dysplasia. Friendly viruses - could harnessing the power of phages - naturally occurring viruses that prey on bacteria - help fight the threat posed by growing resistance to antibiotics? Cervical smears follow up - if women in their late 60s are among those most likely to develop cancer of the cervix why aren't they included in the national screening programme? And the space age hospital bed that can detect everything from infections to some types of cancer. But this one isn't in the sick bay of the Star Ship Enterprise - it's in a hospital in Leicester.

But first, the budget and minimum pricing of alcohol. Should alcoholic drinks in England and Wales have a minimum price - equivalent to around 45p a unit - to stem drink related problems? The move, which would roughly double the price of some of the cheaper strong lagers and ciders, remains the subject of fierce political debate but does it actually work? Inside Health's resident sceptic Margaret McCartney has been examining the evidence behind the plans - and Margaret this is a public health initiative you actually believe in. I never thought I would see the day….

McCartney

Well this is the day and it has come. I am actually full committed to the idea that this sounds like a really good evidence based public health intervention that could actually save people harm and prevent lives being damaged or ended early.

Porter

So persuade me - what's the evidence?

McCartney

Well there is actually a fair bit of evidence in different places in the world. The strongest evidence, I think, comes from a province called Saskatchewan in Canada who building up over a couple of decades decided to have an effective minimum price of alcohol in 2010 and they raised the prices by about 10%, so there's a minimum price per unit of alcohol. And they looked to see what happened before and after. And they basically found a reduction in total consumption of alcohol by about 8.4% but in particular they found that cheap strong drinks were the ones that were being purchased less. And they also found when they went to look at the health benefits or otherwise of what happened next they found there was a mass of difference basically in the amount of alcohol related deaths and harm that had been caused by alcohol that were changed after this new policy came into place by about a 32% reduction in deaths which were wholly due to alcohol and about a 20% reduction in acute problems related to alcohol, chronic problems related alcohol - things like foetal alcohol syndrome, things like heart disease related to alcohol - and there were benefits in all of those areas.

Porter

Because this is a concern isn't it that by increasing the price of alcohol, so say doubling the price of the cheapest strong cider in the supermarket, that it will reduce consumption but actually it won't stop the people who've got a problem drinking as much. But you're saying that it does?

McCartney

Well that's what the evidence is saying. I think it's really interesting when you look at the distribution of alcohol consumption across the population - so 45% of alcohol consumed in the UK is consumed by just the heaviest 10% of drinkers and the lightest - 40% - of drinkers account for just 2% of our total alcohol consumption. So you can see there's not an even distribution here, it's not that there's a slow increase, really the vast majority of alcohol is consumed at the top end.

Porter

And at what level do you set the minimum pricing? I mean they've muted - I've heard figures varying between 40 and 50p per unit, so a can of lager might be a minimum price, a strong one, of £1.50?

McCartney

Yeah so in Scotland they're proposing that the minimum price should be 50p which means that an own brand vodka will go from costing £8.72 just now to £13.13 after. And there's been evidence done, for example, in Edinburgh they went and they looked at people - they asked people who had problem drinking who'd been admitted to hospital what it was that they drunk and they found that mean price of the alcohol they were drinking was 43pence, so it tended to be cheap strong lagers.

Porter

Minimum alcohol pricing will impact on anyone who drinks - but there is another, more targeted initiative, aimed at people who fall foul of the law as a result of their drinking - sobriety orders. We are joined now by Sally Marlow, alcohol researcher at the Institute of Psychiatry to explain more. Sally, what is a sobriety order?

Marlow

A sobriety order is very simple, people who are violent offenders are asked to stop drinking and they're monitored by wearing a tag round their ankle but they're also monitored by coming in for breathalysers twice daily.

Porter

You say they're asked - they're told?

Marlow

Well they're told, yeah, it's an order, it's not a request, it is an order.

Porter

And what happens if they don't abide by that order?

Marlow

If they don't abide by that order they go straight to jail, do not pass go, do not collect £200. They go for a day or they go for two days or they go for seven days depending on the severity of their previous offences.

Porter

And who do you decide who gets the order, I mean you have to presumably work out that alcohol is a major feature in their problem?

Marlow

Well I should say it's not actually happening in the UK yet, it has been happening in the US particularly in the state of South Dakota. And there they use it for people who drive while under the influence of alcohol predominantly but they also use it for violent offenders.

Porter

So this has been used for some time in the States, it's going to be piloted here in London - is that the aim?

Marlow

The aim is to pilot it although the legislation has stalled at the moment but the aim eventually is to pilot it.

Porter

But presumably we've already got an evidence base from the States, I mean does it work?

Marlow

The benefits - immediate benefits to the offenders - they stop drinking, they consume less - liver problems, blood pressure, all the usual things - but there's also the health benefits to the society around them, if you've got very violent offenders who are no longer drinking alcohol and alcohol is a trigger in their offending behaviour and their violence then we're reducing health harms to the people who are at the receiving of those violent behaviours. So one of the things they found is that in South Dakota domestic violence rates across the state as a whole decreased by 9%, so that was a kind of a good emerging prophesy from something which was supposed to deal with driving.

Porter

And how are these order received by the people who are getting them, I mean presumably the alternative's go to prison, so...?

Marlow

Yeah, so people get a choice, it's not you must have the order, people are given a choice - you do this or you go to prison. Compliance is really pretty high - 80% of people in the States don't test positive for alcohol, about 10% test positive two or three times, go to jail, learn their lesson and then don't test positive and there's about 10% - it depends which numbers you look at but there's about 10% that stay drinking basically and they do go to jail.

Porter

Margaret, what are your thoughts on the idea of sobriety orders if they were to be introduced?

McCartney

I suppose the question is of evidence, do they work or don't they work and I suppose the other thing that's tied up is that some people with problem drinking do have a problem with addiction and it's difficult to know whether that's best treated through a punitive system to do with the police and jail or whether that's best treated through mental health aspect and whether sort of groups, for example, like AA - Alcoholics Anonymous - can be very, very useful for a lot of people who need some kind of model to understand their behaviour and to help with that.

Porter

I mean Sally I would hope that these people, as well as having the order slapped on them, are actually being given help to stop drinking?

Marlow

Yeah I think that that's certainly the intention in the UK is that there will - and we already have a framework that does that, we have alcohol treatment requirements where people are required to go to treatment but again it's a false choice - go to jail or go to treatment or often they're attached to a community sentence. I think Margaret is absolutely right to raise the issue of addiction and needing treatment and I think this is a really strong pillar of policy that we need to strengthen, we need to strengthen the services that we offer for people who have got an addiction to alcohol. AA does work but we can't leave it to a self-help organisation, the NHS is not spending enough on alcohol treatment and with the new commissioning guidelines going forward it's really not clear how people with very severe alcohol problems are going to be treated and who's going to pay for that.

McCartney

Yeah I completely agree with that, I think people who have got alcohol addiction issues have generally been treated pretty badly by NHS services, it always seems the first to cut, it's always the thing that it seems somehow tolerable to have very long waiting lists for whereas if that was an issue with something like cancer we would be appalled that people are having to wait for three or four months for treatment for a very severe problem that's likely to shorten their life and harm people around them as well.

Porter

Margaret McCartney and Sally Marlow we must leave it there - thank you both very much.

Last week Margaret looked at antibiotic resistance and our report prompted a couple of you to e-mail us asking about the latest on phage technology - might it be an alternative to antibiotics?

Phages - or bacteriophages to give them their full name - are viruses that prey on bacteria. They are the most abundant microbe on the planet and are found everywhere bacteria are. So sample your local river and you will not only find bacteria feasting on the debris in the water, but phages feasting on them too.

Each phage preys on a specific type of bacterium - they have no interest in anything else, and that includes us. Before killing the bacterium the virus takes over and forces it to make and release hordes of new phages. A self-propagating weapon - the most deadly type.

A documentary in the '90s about the successful use of phages in a hospital in Georgia helped put them on the map here in the UK, but things seem to have gone a bit quiet ever since.

Dr Martha Clokie is Reader in Microbiology at the University of Leicester.

Clokie

Any environment that you go to anywhere you will generally find there are between 10 and a hundred times more phages than there are bacteria, so if you're walking home from work and you look in the puddles on the road they'll be full of bacteria happily living on the dead bits of leaf in that puddle and controlling those bacteria, even in that setting, you will have bacteriophages.

Porter

I mean the obvious conclusion is - and I remember the story first being muted in the '90s that you could harness the power of the phage to help us fight bacterial infections but it seems to have disappeared, what's happened to the story?

Clokie

Well really it was, as you say, there were people who talked about it in the '90s it was muted as an idea but actually it goes - the story goes way back before that so people developed bacteriophages as a therapeutic in the '20s and '30s in France and in Georgia but then in the West very little happens because of the antibiotics coming online and becoming widely available. So antibiotics were seen as being easier. So if you want to use a phage you really have to know what you're treating, so you need a link between - you need to know the bacteria that's causing the infection and then you need to make sure you're using the right phage for it. With antibiotics you don't need that level of knowledge, so antibiotics were seen as the panacea so there was really no motivation in the West to develop them as a therapeutic. And then it's more recently when we were just realising there are so many bacteria now that we're only one antibiotic or two antibiotics ahead of that we're realising actually we need to perhaps revisit bacteriophages and see how we can use them.

Porter

So when we use antibiotics it's a bit like throwing a bomb into a room whereas using a phage is sending in an assassin to take out the person who's causing the trouble?

Clokie

Yeah - yeah that's perfect, bacteriophages are almost like the sharp shooters, they will go in and just take that one bacteria out.

Porter

How have they been used successfully?

Clokie

Well they've been used successfully where you have a strong link between bacteriophage researchers and doctors, so where they use them in Georgia as patients come in with a bacterial infection they'll take a swab, the doctors will give the swab to the phage researchers who will find then - see what that bacteria is and find appropriate phages for it and then deploy that back to the doctor to treat the patient. Where they've been used, for example, quite effectively is in things like diabetic leg ulcers which - where people have had open wounds for perhaps two years and they haven't healed despite the normal wound management practices but after the deployment of bacteriophages applied probably to a dressing which will be wrapped around the wound the infection gets better much more rapidly.

Porter

It sounds like a field that's full of potential, why do you think it's not really taken off?

Clokie

I think until recently there's just been little motivation - antibiotics were seen as the answer so because of the complexities involved with actually having to find the appropriate phages and then how to develop them as a product, how to patent them and protect them and regulate them and do all the necessities of clinical trials I think there's been huge barriers there as people not knowing the best way to move forward.

Porter

Yes because presumably it must be tricky to patent a bacteriophage, something that occurs in nature?

Clokie

Yes it's possible but difficult. And I think because of that there's been very little funding from companies to develop bacteriophages. And I think as well it was seen I think certainly in the West it was seen as a sort of strange crazy idea that people tried and failed, it definitely suffered a certain amount of prejudice.

Porter

Do you detect a change in the winds that might mean that more money might be heading this way?

Clokie

Yes I think that there are a lot of research groups now all over the world who are focusing on different bacteria and trying to understand the sort of basic phage biology and there's also a much more increased engagement with doctors, doctors I think until recently have been in a way a little bit sniffy about using bacteriophages but at phage meetings you can see there's more and more doctors coming to these meetings who are interested and who are really motivated by the very applied aspects of bacteriophage research.

Porter

Last week's item on cervical smears prompted this anonymous question from a 59 year old woman.

Read

If, as your guest suggested last week, women in their sixties are among those most likely to get cancer of the cervix, why does the national screening programme stop before they are out of this danger zone?

Porter

A question we put to that guest - Dr Anne Szarewski, Senior Lecturer at the Wolfson Inistitue of Preventive medicine.

Szarewski

You only stop if you've had normal smears, so that's the important thing, but if you have an abnormal smear - this lady's 59 - so if she was to have an abnormal smear now she wouldn't be stopping at 64, she'd have to have three normal smears. And in England we stop at the age of 64 and the same happens in Wales. In Scotland they stop at the age of 60. But basically she wouldn't just be allowed to stop or just told to stop if she'd had an abnormality.

Porter

But if you've had normal smears right up until the upper age limit the chances are you're never going to run into trouble?

Szarewski

Well that's the point, that's why we do stop because if you catch HPV it's going to take at least 10 years to develop an abnormality, develop cervical cancer, and so if you've got a normal smear at 64 then you're covered until you're at least 74 and so the chances that anything is going to go wrong at that stage are very, very, very small.

Porter

So this second peak that occurs in women in their 60s we would be picking signs of that up as abnormal smears in women in their 50s?

Szarewski

Exactly.

Porter

Anne Szarewski.

And we've had another e-mail on the subject from a slightly different perspective: ""I was told at my last smear, aged 61,"" writes the anonymous listener, ""that ladies in our practice over 60 didn't have sex, so no more tests for me. Confirmed by a letter from the PCT.""

All I can say is your practice must be very different to mine, perhaps the right advice for the wrong reason.

Now do you have a newborn baby in the family? If so are they ever swaddled? It may be an old fashioned practice, but swaddling has made something of a comeback in recent years - some midwives and health visitors recommend it as a way of soothing a distressed child, and it has become a popular method for calming children with colic.

But there is a downside - straightening a baby's legs and holding them together, which is happens when they are swaddled, can hinder the development of a healthy hip joint leading to hip dysplasia and arthritis later in life.

Paediatric orthopaedic surgeon Professor Nicholas Clarke is all too familiar with the results of the resurgence of swaddling among the children he sees in his busy clinic at Southampton General Hospital.

Clarke

Swaddling is where the baby is swaddled with blankets with their legs straight and the arms restrained so that it's comfortable and quiet. The hips need to be apart, the legs need to be apart for the hips to develop particularly in the first six months.

Porter

The first six months. So what's the downside from your perspective?

Clarke

Well the downside is that we're seeing that resurgence and we are seeing in our hip screening clinics babies with hip dysplasia exacerbated by swaddling. And frankly this is shocking for us.

Actuality

Did you swaddle her?

Did I swaddle her as a baby - baby baby? Sometimes.

Porter

At least one in a hundred children in the UK will develop some degree of hip dysplasia and it accounts for a third of all hip replacements done in adults under the age of 60. If caught early the hips can be repositioned and encouraged to develop normally by putting the baby in a special harness. But if missed or picked up late more extreme measures are required and the outlook is nowhere near as good.

Patient

The only thing I knew was what the midwife told me when the babies are born that they like to be swaddled because obviously being in the mummy's tummy they're all comfy and warm and cosy so that's kind of how they suggest to keep the baby calm and definitely swaddled at birth. So the hips would be towards each other rather than out as they should be, they kind of pushed together as it were.

Porter

Girls are at particular risk of developing hip dysplasia, as are babies that are born upside down in the breech position - and it also tends to run in families.

Patient

My niece also had a problem and also Greg's brother had it when he was young but none of them have had it as bad as our son has but there is a family history on both sides which they think contributes to it as well. We had a few too many risk factors unfortunately.

Patient's husband

Grandad's just had a double hip replacement so...

Patient

Yeah grandma needs a hip operation, dad's got a dodgy hip, hips aren't particularly strong in our family.

Clarke

Hip dysplasia is under-development of the joint, it's a spectrum of abnormality - at one end you've got the tricky hip which you see in general practice and screening and at the other end you've got babies who have got dislocated hips and then you've got children who are untreated walk into the clinic at the age two with a dislocated hip. The thing is it's multi-factorial but if you don't allow the hip to develop normally and you assault it with these different positions, that are not physiological, you will not encourage normal hip development.

Porter

And that normal hip development, even in mild cases, could have implications for the child, either during childhood or adulthood as well presumably?

Clarke

Late dysplasia is associated with premature osteoarthritis and total hip replacement and there are still from the last generation lots of women undergoing hip replacement in this country.

Porter

And do we know what sort of impact swaddling's having?

Clarke

Well we do from the historical data. The North American Indians used to swaddle their babies for transport issues and they had a very high incidence of congenital dysplasia. The Laplanders used to swaddle their babies because they were cold and they used to put them on boards and there was a huge incidence of hip dysplasia. And in the 1980s in Japan all the babies were swaddled for comfort and warmth and they realised that there was a very high incidence of hip dysplasia and they started a campaign where they put educated grandmothers to tell their daughters not to swaddle their babies and the incidence went down by something like 10% - a huge number of cases that did not need treatment subsequently.

Porter

So during that first six months you should not be restricting your child - legs should be bent and apart effectively is what you're saying?

Clarke

There is a technique of safe swaddling which parents can look at and there is also the question of the positioning in car seats and in baby carriers. So having a baby in a baby carrier facing outwards in the first six months, as fathers do, and walk round the shopping centre pulling on the legs to pull them down is not physiological. And we are also trying to educate the midwives.

Porter

Because it's important that they're the ones - and health visitors and midwives and people.

Clarke

And these are the people that we want to get through to.

Porter

Professor Nicholas Clarke - and you will find a link to the video showing the safe swaddling technique he mentioned on our website - go to bbc.co.uk/radio4 and click on I for Inside Health.

Music - Star Trek theme tune

Porter

Like most doctors I have always envied the kit that Bones McCoy had in his sick bay - particularly his scanner that told him what was wrong with everyone. Well in the busy A&E department at Leicester Royal Infirmary a team of researchers is working on a smart bed using space age technology to detect everything from infection to cancer. It's a touch more Heath Robinson - and a lot noisier - than Bones's kit, as I discovered when I went to see the Diagnostics Development Unit, the most expensive bed in the NHS. Tim Coats is Professor of Emergency Medicine at the University of Leicester and part of the team who built it.

Coats

So what we've got here is a room that contains all the equipment and a bed next door in the emergency department in our resuscitation room that contains the patient and the sensors that are linked to this equipment to try and give us a bit more of an idea early on what's going on with each of our patients.

Porter

So at the moment a patient comes in to a conventional bed, what sort of monitoring would they get as standard in any A&E department?

Coats

So we'll be monitoring things such as the pulse, the blood pressure, the blood oxygen saturation - the sort of things that you would see on any of the TV shows with a patient hooked up to a monitor in the bed.

Porter

But this bed here is the next generation, so what are you adding on top of that?

Coats

So those measures are pretty crude in some ways. If I want to know how your heart is working just measuring your blood pressure or your pulse rate isn't really a good indication. So we're using a technique called thoracic electrical bio impedance which looks at changes in electricity in the heart, it's actually quite an old technique, was invented by Nasa to monitor astronauts, hasn't really been used in emergency care but seems a really good way of actually measuring how strongly the heart is pumping and how much blood it's pumping out with each heartbeat.

Sims

My name is Professor Mark Sims, I'm part of the space research centre at the University of Leicester and I co-direct the Diagnostics Development Unit alongside Tim Coats. My sort of day job, if you like, is actually developing instruments to look for life on Mars. So we were sitting around one lunchtime and we were speculating what you could do with modern technology - could you go back and do what doctors did a hundred years ago, which is feel the pulse, look at the patient and smell them - and that's how diagnosis was done a hundred years ago and we said well modern technology's probably sufficiently good now you can probably do that again but from a technological point of view which would give doctors hints, it wouldn't replace the doctors but it would give them hints, it would make the whole system much more efficient.

Porter

Looking forward 20, 30 years I mean this sort of technology to put it very simply I mean it says well actually your patient's got a breathing problem because they're not very well oxygenated, a little bit of liver failure and the kidneys aren't quite what they should be and that technically is possible now?

Sims

It's technically possible now...

Porter

What the data means is?

Sims

That's the key, the real problem is what does the data mean - can you tell an ill patient from a normal patient?

Coats

And that is exactly the question that we're trying to answer here. So what we're doing here is we're using these new techniques, we're monitoring a whole bunch of patients, some of whom are sick, some of whom are not sick, so we're getting the idea with these new techniques what is the range that you would expect in sick patients, in normal patients. Now once we've got that information we can start saying okay does this information mean anything and then can we treat patients differently depending on this new information that we're getting? So we're doing breath analysis - we're looking at the compounds that are present in the patient's breath. Now the breath reflects the internal metabolism and also something about what's going on in the lungs. So, for example, if a patient's got a pneumonia we can look at the compounds that are coming out in their breath and we can tell perhaps which type of bacteria is causing that pneumonia which will enable us to give the right treatment early on.

Sims

This is the mass spectrometer which is the biggest piece and the noisiest piece of equipment in this equipment room and this is the equipment which does the breath analysis. Mass spectrometers were used in space research to look for organic compounds on other planets. The mass spectrometer we use here has actually come from the chemistry department where they're looking at things like atmospheric pollution, so what it's doing is continuously sampling the air from the patient's breath...

Porter

And it's things that we're all familiar with - with smelling on people's breath - I mean alcohol's a good example, so this machine can detect tiny amounts presumably of all sorts of other things?

Sims

It can detect parts per trillion.

Coats

So we're looking at both what's goes on in the patient's breath, what goes on in the patient's pulse and cardiovascular system and then the look of the patient with the imaging from space science because doctors often look at the patient from the look of the patient, from the colour of a patient, from the tone of their skin - different skin tones are associated with different diseases. Well if we can get a hyper spectral camera, which analyses very carefully the colour in the patient's skin that gives perhaps an indication in a more scientific way of what doctors have been looking at for probably hundreds of years.

Porter

I say you look a bit peaky but you can actually come up with an objective measurement of that.

Coats

I can perhaps say what peaky is in terms of nanometres of wavelengths. So the area that's looking particular promising is in patients with sepsis - sepsis is a huge problem to the NHS...

Porter

Serious infection.

Coats

Serious infection, infection that's getting into the blood to be blood infection. And one of our real problems is early detection - once a patient is realised that they're septic we've got powerful antibiotics and treatments but if you look at the patients that come to harm from sepsis and don't have good outcomes a lot of the time it's that people didn't realise what was going on until quite a late stage. What we're hoping is that this sort of imaging may be an earlier detection system to detect the patients earlier on.

Sims

What we'd like to do eventually if all this equipment pays off, if all this work pays off, is actually take these devices and miniaturise them and maybe 10 years' time, 15 years' time there'll be miniature devices in the next generation ambulance, so you can do this diagnosis on the way to the hospital and get some early warning signs of potential problems with the patient before they actually get there and may be eventually it gets into GPs' surgeries and ultimately you go to the Star Trek Tri-Corder but that's probably 20 years off...

Porter

That's what I'd like, that's the machine that you just sort of scan the patient with and it tells you what's wrong. A few years off I believe.

Sims

A few years off.

'Why I drink 100 units of alcohol a week',Heavy drinkers share their boozing habits - including spending £500 a month on wine.,[],None,"Image copyright Getty Images

How much alcohol do you drink?

People have been sharing their drinking habits after presenter Adrian Chiles revealed he sometimes drank more than 100 units a week - more than seven times the recommended limit.

He said drinking never affects his life and he considers himself a social drinker, not an alcoholic.

Other heavy drinkers have been speaking about their alcohol consumption.

'Do I want to stop? No'

Paul Tomlinson, 48, from Thornton-Cleveleys in Lancashire says it is ""easy to rack up drinking when you're sat at home"".

""I regularly drink 80 to 100 units a week, most of it between Friday and Sunday.

""On each night I will usually have two or three beers - sometimes alcohol free now actually - followed by a bottle of wine and then two or three large gin and tonics.

""This is roughly 16 to 18 units a night for three consecutive nights. I will then do at least two or three more bottles of wine in the week with a couple of gin and tonics again.

Image copyright Paul Tomlinson Image caption Paul Tomlinson says society primes people to drink alcohol

""Do I consider myself an alcoholic? No! Do I want to stop drinking at the level I do? Not really.

""I have a disabled son who is 24 so don't go out often and as a result drink more at home.

""I don't go to bed feeling outrageously drunk and I don't black out on the sofa.""

'£500 a month on wine'

One man, who chose to remain anonymous, says his father was an ""old fashioned"" alcoholic who started drinking in the morning - but that he is not an alcoholic.

""I find myself in the habit of putting away one and a half to two bottles of white wine every night, unless I'm really thirsty in which case it might be two and a half bottles.

""I start at 6 or 7pm, couple of glasses whilst preparing family supper, continue through PS4 ""wind down"" time, another couple of glasses.

""Then usually finish off the second bottle whilst listening to music. Tada! £500 a month on wine.

""I'm in a strange position, as I can (and do) stop when I want to - sometimes for a month or two just to prove to myself I'm not an alcoholic like my dad.

""I'll go out with my mates and not touch a drop, again - just to prove a point to myself. And yet I still drink far, far too much.

Image copyright Getty Images

""I'm rarely drunk nowadays, although obviously I still don't drive. I just wish someone would make a drink that tastes as nice as wine, without the alcohol.

""I'm currently losing weight and so have ""limited"" myself to a half to one bottle of wine a night.

""I find that the problem is the habit more than alcohol. I smoked 20 plus a day for 20 years then quit five years ago, with no patches etc.

""Never felt like a relapse, never been tempted to have 'just one'. I think alcohol is in the same category.

""Although, as I can testify with my father, the drug is insidious and rather than just kill your body, if you let it, it will kill your personality first.""

'I'm all or nothing'

Adrian Chiles' account of his alcohol consumption ""mirrors almost exactly"" how Mark Baker, 58, from North Somerset, says he drinks.

""Like him I drink about 80 to 100 units a week and have done so for many years.

""I have a slight fatty liver (as does he) but otherwise perfectly OK. I have never suffered from depression or anxiety.

""I drink mostly out of habit. I never get drunk, drink and drive, I never drink in the mornings or at lunchtime, I just like a drink in the evening to wind down and relax.

""I am an export manager so drinking is part of the territory.

Image copyright Getty Images

""Last year in October I stopped drinking for a month. I was worried that I was dependent on it.

""I found it easy to do especially as there are so many products on the market with low or no alcohol. I could still have a beer, glass of wine or even a gin and tonic. Yes, there is low alcohol spirit.

""Like Adrian, I will probably give up drinking rather than rationing it as when I have tried that in the past it never seems to work. I am definitely an all or nothing person.""

'I will try and cut down'

Annemarie McAleese, 48, from Belfast, owns her own restaurant and says she starts drinking wine when she gets home as she ""potters about"".

""On average I would drink two bottles of white wine each night, and have done for the last seven years.

""I have my own business, and work in it five or six days per week.

""After reading this article, I think now is the time to rethink my drinking habits.

""It's a very bad habit. I think I will try to cut down. I think I use owning my business as an excuse because it can be quite stressful.

""I won't watch the programme with my husband because I don't need somebody yapping in my ear 'you need to stop', I need to do this for myself.""

'High functioning alcoholic'

John, from Essex, says he considered himself a ""moderate social drinker"" until he developed liver disease.

""Then I gave up drinking altogether but the liver disease worsened leading to many hospital visits and the need for a liver transplant.

""I had never missed work or put drink ahead of all else but when I detailed out my daily drinking to numerous doctors over a nine-month period I was embarrassed to realise that I was effectively a high-functioning alcoholic.

""I am pleased to say that thanks to my organ donor I have led a healthy, happy life for the last eight years and become a grandfather three times.

""Something I would have missed if I had carried on as before.

""If Adrian's show makes anyone seriously look at the amount they drink and reduce it then he is doing a great job.

""On the subject of giving up alcohol I feel sometimes too much is made of how difficult this is, rather than concentrating on the benefits of being sober.

""Better health, better sleep, no hangovers, higher alertness and an ability to enjoy things with a clear head.""

Alcohol and health

The number of adults who say they drink alcohol is at its lowest level since surveys began in 2005, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

The NHS recommends not drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week. If you do drink that much, it is best to spread it over three or more days.

One unit of alcohol is 10ml of pure alcohol, which is equivalent to half a pint of normal-strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits.

A small glass of wine contains about 1.5 units, a standard glass is 2.1 and a bottle of wine contains 10 units.

Meanwhile, a can of lager, beer or cider is two units. A pint is two or three units, depending on whether it is lower or higher strength.

According to the NHS, someone may need help if:","['think', 'units', 'alcohol', 'dont', 'stop', 'need', 'wine', '100', 'drink', 'drinking', 'week']","""I regularly drink 80 to 100 units a week, most of it between Friday and Sunday.

Lou Vincent: The most brutal form of apology,Cricketer Lou Vincent this week admitted he was a cheat. His apology came in stark style.,"['Justin Parkinson', 'Bbc News Magazine']",None,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lou Vincent

The cricketer Lou Vincent has admitted attempting to fix matches. His apology came in stark style.

He exhales loudly. Then he begins his statement: ""My name is Lou Vincent and I am a cheat.""

The former New Zealand cricketer, in 10 words, admits what he has done, how he has contravened and undermined his own sport by accepting money for match-fixing. Viewers are left in no doubt.

Vincent, at the age of 35, has been banned for life from playing, coaching or participating in any other way in organised cricket after breaching 18 anti-corruption rules in matches played in 2008 and 2011.

Even so, the nature of the opening of his video confession - in which he goes on to say he has ""shamed"" his sport, country and family - seems unusually stark.

The formula of the opening words is the same as that used by some members of Alcoholics Anonymous. Those attending at meetings are not compelled to say: ""My name is XXXX and I am an alcoholic."" But many choose to do so, citing its cathartic effect and the creation of a sense of community.

Vincent, who has suffered from depression, is unlikely to feel the same immediate mutual support from his fellow cricketers. But might he eventually gain respect for his statement, in which he also says he wants to face up to what he has done ""like a man and accept the consequences""?

""It's very healthy,"" says Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at Lancaster University. ""You don't get enough of people admitting when they've done something wrong, particularly in the workplace.""

Image copyright Reuters

Uruguayan footballer Luis Suarez has faced criticism over his initial refusal to apologise for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini in a World Cup match. He has since given a qualified apology - one that expressed sympathy for his victim but did not fully address Suarez's culpability and ongoing problem.

""What the cricketer has done is completely unlike the Suarez situation,"" says Cooper. ""If Suarez had come out straight away and said he'd done wrong under the stress of the situation he would have received much more sympathy. What's happened here in cricket will raise Vincent in people's estimation. The timing is absolutely key.""

Vincent recorded his statement after admitting to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) that he had committed match-fixing offences in Twenty20 games when he played for Lancashire and Sussex. It pre-empted the ECB's own announcement.

Sussex County Cricket Club has welcomed the punishment of Vincent, who has played in 23 Tests and 102 one-day internationals. ""The episode has been a very difficult time for our players, staff and indeed all supporters of Sussex Cricket,"" says chief executive Zac Toumazi. ""We are determined to do all we can to drive this issue away from our game and remain vigilant and committed in doing so.""

Cricket is keen to clean up its image after revelations going back more than a decade, when it was revealed the South African captain Hansie Cronje had fixed matches.

In his confession in 2000, Cronje opened by saying he had been a Christian all his life and had tried to ""walk the way the Lord wanted me to walk"".

Hansie Cronje

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption South Africa cricket captain Hanse Cronje confessed to match fixing in 2000

Right-handed middle-order batsman appointed South Africa captain in 1994, aged 24

Charged by Indian police in April 2000 with fixing one-day international matches, but initially denied wrongdoing

Sacked as captain four days later when he changed his story and admitted taking money to provide information to gambling interests

Banned from cricket for life in June 2000

Died in plane crash in South Africa's Western Cape in 2002

The golfer Tiger Woods, in his scripted 2010 apology in front of the world's media for his marital infidelities, also adopted a more gradual introduction to the description of his wrongdoings than Vincent.

""Good morning. And thank you for joining me,"" he said. ""Many of you in the room are my friends. Many of you in this room know me. Many of you have cheered for me, or worked with me, or supported me, and now, every one of you has good reason to be critical of me.

""I want to say to each of you, simply, and directly, I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish behaviour I engaged in.""

Could Vincent's more direct statement lead to some form of public redemption, even if it does not, and cannot, involve any future involvement with cricket?

""What he has done is probably the best way,"" says speechwriter and presentation coach Max Atkinson. ""It reminds me of (Liberal Democrat leader) Paddy Ashdown in 1992 admitting he had had an affair. That worked. He came across as honest. It's best just to come out and say it.""

The difference is that Ashdown could argue his personal life did not interfere with his professional one. Like Cronje, Vincent cannot.

But Peter Davies, a consultant at Manchester PR firm RMS, thinks there is a chance of a return to some standing. ""Lou Vincent's statement comes across like it's personal,"" he says. ""That's good. Although he must have had advice, probably including from his lawyers, it doesn't sound like that. It's not over-scripted and he does it in his own voice.

""But Vincent has lots of work to do if he wants to change his image. He'll have to do something to show he's trying to make a difference and he's truly changed his ways.""

Is it time to cut back or do we need to spend more? Should the NHS be paying to treat people with alcohol-related conditions at all? Should the drinks industry play a part in this treatment?

And does a patient in need of a liver transplant because of alcohol abuse deserve to get one?

The headstones with unusual stories to tell,A tour around the interesting stories found lurking in English graveyards.,"['Bethan Bell', 'Bbc News']",None,"Image copyright Getty Images

Cemeteries offer a heady mix of history, beauty, nature and death to those who enjoy browsing around them. Burial grounds such as Highgate in north London, which host the graves of the rich and famous, draw thousands of visitors. But there are scores of other less well known but interesting graves around England.

The barmaid who taunted a tiger

Image copyright Getty Images

In 1703, Hannah Twynnoy became Britain's first recorded victim of a tiger.

She was a barmaid at the White Lion in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, when a travelling menagerie set up in the pub's large rear yard, ready to attract paying crowds.

Hannah was warned against upsetting the tiger but she enjoyed bothering and poking at the big cat - until one day it discovered the cage door was open. Fed up of the pesky barmaid, the tiger launched itself on the unfortunate servant and mauled her to death.

The stone, in Malmesbury Abbey has the epitaph:

In bloom of life

She's snatched from hence

She had not room to make defence;

For Tyger fierce

Took life away

And here she lies

In a bed of clay

Until the Resurrection Day.

The diver who saved a cathedral

Image copyright FindaGrave/Getty Images

William Walker was a deep-sea diver who, in 1905, was employed to help repair the foundations of Winchester Cathedral.

Large cracks had appeared in the cathedral's walls and vaulted ceilings, some of which were wide enough for owls to roost in.

Because Winchester has a high underlying water table and the cathedral is built on peaty soil, trenches dug below filled with water before any reinforcing work could be done.

So Walker, who usually worked at Portsmouth dockyard, was recruited.

A tunnel was excavated beneath the building and for six years he spent nearly six hours a day underwater, in darkness, replacing and shoring up the foundations with his bare hands. He worked entirely by touch. Eventually he propped the cathedral up with 900,000 bricks, 114,900 concrete blocks and 25,800 bags of cement.

Because it took him so long to put on and take off his heavy diving suit, when he stopped for a break he would just take off his helmet in order to eat his lunch and smoke his pipe.

As if that was not enough effort, each weekend he cycled 150 miles - home to Croydon, south London, before returning to work on Monday.

He died aged 49 during the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918. His grave, at Beckenham Cemetery in Bromley, south-east London, bears the words: ""The diver who with his own hands saved Winchester Cathedral.""

The soldier whose beer was too weak

In Winchester, there is a grave which pays homage to a 26-year-old grenadier in the North Regiment of the Hants Militia. Thomas Thetcher died after drinking contaminated small (weak) beer when he was hot.

Before the invention of modern sanitation, people would drink small beer when fresh water was unavailable. This was because the alcohol was toxic to water-borne pathogens.

However, it was not enough to prevent Thetcher catching a fever and dying.

Following his death in 1764, his comrades arranged for a jocular headstone inscription warning of the dangers of drink. It read:

Here sleeps in peace a Hampshire Grenadier,

Who caught his death by drinking cold small beer,

Soldiers be wise from his untimely fall

And when ye're hot drink strong or none at all.

In 1918, the tombstone caught the attention of a young American soldier called Bill Wilson, who was camped nearby with his US Army unit.

Twenty-one years later, following a battle with alcoholism, he founded Alcoholics Anonymous and in 1939 published a book about his experience.

In it he claimed the gravestone had been an ""ominous warning which I failed to heed"", and printed the first two lines of the verse in the front of his book.

However, it appears he misunderstood the headstone, as he missed out the crucial advice about only drinking strong beer.

On 12 May - the anniversary of Thetcher's death - people gather at the grave to drink (strong) beer and raise a glass to the grenadier.

Peter the Wild Boy

Image copyright Neale Monks/Historic Royal Palaces

Peter had been found living alone and naked in a German forest in 1725. He could not talk, and would scamper about on all fours rather than walk.

When he was about 12 he was brought to London by King George I where he became a ""human pet"" at Kensington Palace. However, his inability to learn table manners or speech, hatred of wearing clothes - even his specially-made green velvet suit - and lack of decorum led to him falling out of favour.

The court paid for him to retire to a Hertfordshire farm with a generous pension and when he died, aged about 72, the locals paid for a headstone. Even today, flowers are laid on his grave.

Peter's funeral was held at St Mary's Church, Northchurch, Hertfordshire, and was paid for by the government. His gravestone was provided by local people.

At the time, courtiers assumed Peter's behaviour was the result of being brought up by wolves or bears. However, modern analysis of a portrait suggests Peter had a rare genetic condition known as Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome.

The bleeding tombstone of Richard Smith

St Mary's Church in Hinckley, Leicestershire, is the last resting place of Richard Smith who was killed on 12 April 1727, aged 20.

Although his headstone is fairly run-of-the-mill, the story behind his death serves as an abject warning to young men with a fondness for messing about when they should be paying attention.

According to the local history club, a recruiting sergeant for the army had come to Hinckley and was singing the praises of taking the King's shilling. Richard, rather than listening, made jokes and quips until the recruiter lost his temper. In a slight overreaction, the soldier gave the crowd an unplanned demonstration in how to use a pike in close quarter combat - and killed Richard.

For years there were reports of the headstone appearing red and tradition held the gravestone sweated blood on the anniversary of the murder.

However, a more prosaic explanation was suggested by a researcher in 1936. The gravestone used to be positioned under a block of red sandstone and it was thought that the ""blood"" being sweated may have resulted in water dripping from this block.

The Woodplumpton Witch

Nestled among the neat headstones at St Anne's churchyard in Woodplumpton, near Preston, is a boulder marking the grave of Meg Shelton.

Known as ""the Fylde Hag"", she was accused of witchcraft in the late 17th Century. Allegations centred on the fairly tame ""stealing milk"" and the more-impressive ""turning herself into a animal"".

She was killed in mysterious circumstances when a barrel crushed her against the wall of her cottage.

Folklore has it she dug her way out of her grave on more than one occasion. She was eventually buried head down in a narrow shaft so that if she tried to claw her way out she would be heading in the wrong direction - and instead burrow her way to Hell.

The boulder was put on top as an extra way of keeping her anchored in the grave.

According to legend, if you walk three times around the boulder while chanting ""I don't believe in witches"", Meg's bony hand will rise from her grave and grasp your ankle.","['death', 'copyright', 'headstones', 'gravestone', 'headstone', 'drink', 'grave', 'london', 'unusual', 'way', 'water', 'tell', 'winchester']","Image copyright Getty ImagesCemeteries offer a heady mix of history, beauty, nature and death to those who enjoy browsing around them.

Chris Bevan: Andy Morrison's biggest battle,"I am halfway through my interview with Andy Morrison when I notice the mass of scars on his knuckles for the first time, testimony to the scrapes he was involved...",[],None,"I am halfway through my interview with Andy Morrison when I notice the mass of scars on his knuckles for the first time, testimony to the scrapes he was involved in during his colourful career.

""I had too many fights to put into my book,"" the former Manchester City, Huddersfield, Blackpool and Plymouth centre-back tells me of some of the brutal off-pitch tales which litter his new autobiography. ""So I just mentioned the ones which helped shape my career for better or worse.""

An unashamed bruiser he may be, but Morrison does not glorify his violent past. In any case, his biggest battles have been psychological, not physical.

In a week during which footballers' mental health has been in the spotlight following Gary Speed's death, Morrison's story, which was published last month, makes poignant reading.

As a player, he battled alcoholism and, at his lowest ebb in 1999, which actually coincided with some of his best times on the field with City, he considered taking his own life before vowing instead to ditch the drink.

Morrison was the inspiration behind City's promotion that year from what is now League One - a time when this week's Champions League tie with Bayern Munich would have been unthinkable for his old club and one that seems light years away from their current status as mega-rich Premier League leaders. He has been on quite a journey himself.

""It's said that when you reach the pits of despair you turn within and ask for help,"" Morrison reflects. ""I was on my hands and knees when I looked at the sky and said 'please can you help me, I cannot take any more of this pain'. Thankfully I got the support I needed from Alcoholics Anonymous and for almost 13 years I have not touched a drop.""

But that was not the end of his problems. After injury curtailed his career in 2002 at the age of 32, Morrison faced financial ruin, while the chronic depression he has battled since hanging up his boots came because he missed the buzz of matchdays that had been part of his life since he was a young teenager.

""When you retire, there is a part of you where you keep a stiff upper lip,"" Morrison, now assistant manager at Evo-Stik League Premier Division side Northwich Victoria, explained over coffee in a leafy Cheshire village near his home.

""I was saying 'this is the next stage of my life, I'm going to be positive. I'm going to move on and get my coaching badges' and all that sort of stuff.

""But I wasn't prepared in any way to deal with that huge void in my life. I'd been a footballer from the age of 15 and I couldn't have been more institutionalised if I had been in the army. I loved competing.

""When I finished I went through a period of desolation. I had a desperate period of absolute uselessness for anything. Your confidence is affected and it is a downward spiral from there. I had absolutely nothing to look forward to.

""It's hard for footballers because, in so many aspects of your life, you are so much better off than other people but it is where you are in your head at that time that matters. I remember Stan Collymore being ridiculed for suffering from depression. John Gregory, his manager at Aston Villa, said how could someone earning £20,000 a week have it?

""But when you are suffering from chronic depression you don't go to a hole in the wall, stick your card in, look at your balance and see you have £200,000 in the bank and go 'that's it, I feel brilliant'. It's much deeper than that.

""I think people are coming round to understanding it a bit more and hopefully there is no shame attached to it anymore.

""Thankfully for me, I dealt with my drinking problem and my addictive alcoholism before I retired. God only help me if I hadn't, because I only know for sure that I wouldn't be sat here with you talking because it would have just got darker and worse.""

The good news for Morrison, and for those with similar problems, is that there was help out there then, and there still is now.

We do not know the reasons for Speed's death but the debate over mental health in football has been ongoing since Germany goalkeeper Robert Enke took his own life in 2009 and Rushden & Diamonds goalkeeper Dale Roberts killed himself a year later.

And despite the claims of Susannah Strong - author of a booklet on handling depression which the Professional Footballers' Association sent out to ex-players in the wake of Speed's death - that ""there is no attention paid whatsoever to the mental health of footballers"", the reality is that there has been a support system in place for some time.

Morrison, who was a warrior of a player known for inspiring team-mates and fans alike, feels Strong was right when she spoke of his condition being a taboo subject in football but says he was not left high and dry when he did reveal it and hopes others have the strength to do the same.

""There is a lot of support out there for footballers if they want to ask for it but when you are in such a desperate place it is hard to say 'I'm really struggling with life' and lower all your barriers and let your ego go,"" he added. ""I was the captain of every club I played for and I felt it was out of character to say I was struggling.

""When I did, I spoke to counsellors from Sporting Chance Clinic. They offered great help. I was given anti-depression tablets but there is no quick cure. For me, and I can only speak for me, there were no innate words of wisdom which were going to help me through it. It's a process and you have to be strong. You need all the help you can get.

""Anyone who suffers from it has to be brave enough to first recognise it - because that is the hardest thing - and then be willing to ask for help.""

Morrison is in a better place now. Professionally, he is enjoying his job with Northwich and dreaming of coaching in the Premier League. Personally, he savours life with wife Paula and their three children.

He has still not conquered all his demons, however. ""There are days when the black dog is at the bottom of the bed when I wake up,"" Morrison adds. ""He says 'good morning, I've been waiting for you'. There is nothing I can do to stop it happening, but now I know what to do when it does.""

Shot barrister Mark Saunders' 20-year alcohol struggle,"Mark Saunders, the barrister shot dead by police marksmen, was a ""gutsy and polished"" courtroom opponent - but had his own two-decade struggle with alcohol.","['Nick Beake', 'Bbc London Home Affairs Producer']",None,"Image caption Mr Saunders ended two months of sobriety the day before he died

In the crucible of the courtroom, he was an impressive figure.

Described in one directory of lawyers as ""popular, gutsy and polished"", Oxford graduate Mark Saunders fought on behalf of celebrity clients in high-profile and often acrimonious divorce cases.

But for nearly 20 years, he was struggling to control his alcohol intake.

It was following one heavy afternoon binge in the spring of 2008 that 32-year-old Mr Saunders found himself with a bottle of wine in one hand and a shotgun in the other, firing from the window of his £2m flat in Chelsea.

Police said they feared for their safety and the public's. On Thursday an inquest jury agreed that they had lawfully killed Mr Saunders.

When Mr Saunders began drinking at the age of 13, it was not to escape the reality of a sad and deprived life. Rather, it was in the surroundings of his private school in Cheshire.

After gaining his law degree from Christ Church College, Oxford, and serving with the Territorial Army, he joined the respected QEB Chambers in central London.

But while his profession career soared, his descent into alcohol abuse accelerated.

'Out of control'

By 2005 - three years before his death - Mr Saunders was drinking to excess most nights.

He himself admitted he was ""out of control"".

Some weeks he would drink the equivalent of four bottles of spirits. That year, he received a police caution for being drunk and disorderly.

His wife of two years, Elizabeth, also a barrister, told the inquest her husband was a ""sensitive"" man with a ""huge energy and love for life"". They were, she said, ""very much in love"".

Image caption Mr Saunders' marriage to Elizabeth was strained by his drinking

But their marriage was considerably strained by his drinking.

""I know he contacted Alcoholics Anonymous and went there on three or four occasions,"" she told the inquest jury. ""But he felt it wasn't for him, and it didn't work out.

""What Mark wanted to do was control the drinking, to be able to be a social drinker. There were occasions, probably every three months or so, when it went wrong.""

Mr Saunders' best friend Alex Booth often saw what happened when it did go wrong.

""He completely lost touch with reality,"" he said in a statement.

Mr Booth explained how his friend had ended up in casualty on several occasions, and while drinking he would be ""in a fantasy world, he wouldn't respond or engage with you"".

That fantasy world was often induced by cocaine as well as alcohol.

Tests revealed Mr Saunders had used the drug regularly in the six months before his death - although not within the last 12 hours of his life. His wife knew nothing of his drug habit.

Mr Saunders did recognise he had a problem and sought help. To stabilise his mood swings, he was prescribed the antidepressant Prozac.

In 2006, a psychiatrist examined him and warned that if he did not ""abstain completely from all mind-altering substances"" he could find himself being killed in a fight.

'Bulging eyes'

The other fear, according to medical notes, was that Mr Saunders would commit suicide if a period of depression and an alcohol binge coincided.

In February 2008, he told his wife he was giving up drinking for good. He was sober for the next two months. On the evening of 5 May, he had one glass of wine.

The following day would be Mr Saunders' last.

It is unclear at what point in the afternoon he began drinking, but by the time a taxi driver dropped him off near his home at about 1600 BST, it was evident that he was drunk.

Image caption Mr Saunders was shot as he levelled his shotgun from his flat window

Blood tests would later reveal him to be three times over the drink-drive limit.

David Hay, the taxi driver, said: ""At that point he turned back round and I gave him his change and he was looking straight at me and just said: 'I'm going to die'.""

""When he looked at me his eyes were large and bulging. I could see the terror in his eyes.""

Half an hour later, Mr Saunders loaded the shotgun he legally owned and fired the first shots from his kitchen window, triggering the five-hour standoff with armed officers of the Metropolitan Police's CO19 firearms unit.

When the fatal shots were fired at half past 2130 BST, Mr Saunders was alone.

Police had refused his wish to talk to his family - fearing he wanted to say goodbye and take his life.

Instead, he was surrounded by broken glass and a wine bottle as he died.","['alcohol', 'shotgun', 'life', 'inquest', 'months', 'saunders', 'told', 'barrister', 'struggle', 'shot', 'mark', 'drinking', 'occasions', 'wife', '20year', 'mr']","'Out of control'By 2005 - three years before his death - Mr Saunders was drinking to excess most nights.

BBC Inside Out,,[],None,"BINGE DRINKING DRINK CULTURE | Now just about every drink is available with an alcoholic twist to it. Many people are used to socialising over a few drinks, but a trend has developed where those few drinks have become a few more, and a few more after that. Binge drinking, carrying on drinking well past the outer limits of sobriety, is becoming an all-too frequent way to spend a night out. But the costs of drinking, both in personal terms and to wider society are high. Is binge drinking a prelude to later alcohol addiction? It used to be assumed that alcohol damage only affects the middle aged, who after years of drinking end up with a liver that's been shot to bits. The focus has been on the long-term effects of alcoholism. The latest research however suggests that binge drinking causes rapid damage to the brain, and the effects can be seen in a relatively short space of time. Researchers are now also looking at whether this early brain damage, or neurodegeneration, lays the foundation for addiction to alcohol. Patterns of consumption are changing and now we tend to start drinking younger, and down more per sitting. It has been estimated that our overindulgence costs the country £10 billion a year. The medical bill alone is estimated at £3 billion, or 12% of the total amount the NHS spends on its hospitals. Concern is mounting over the number of youngsters who take part in drinking binges. Up to a quarter of 13 and 14 year olds claim that they have ""downed"" at least five alcoholic drinks in a single session. Further medical research suggests that binge drinking in adolescence leads the brain to respond more sensitively to alcohol in the future. Calls are being made to take binge drinking as seriously as we do drink-driving. However alcohol is firmly rooted as part of our leisure culture and it is difficult to educate people as to the dangers of something that is so readily available in our society.

The Government is being put under increasing pressure to try and tackle binge drinking in the same way it continues to target drink-driving at the moment. The 25 year campaign against ""driving under the influence"" has seen the number of deaths fall from more than 1,600 people In 1976 to 520 drink-drive fatalities in 2000. It's not just your liver! Heavy drinking is thought to cause rapid damage to the brain. Campaigners say that binge drinking needs to be tackled in a similar way and that education in the effects of alcohol should be integrated into the National Curriculum. They also say that the emphasis needs to be firmly shifted away from ""drinking until you are completely drunk"" to one of more modest social consumption. The Government has asked the Cabinet Office strategy unit to look at the issues around alcohol and the Department of Health is awaiting the outcome of this to help inform its policy.","['alcohol', 'brain', 'drinks', 'inside', 'binge', 'drinking', 'damage', 'way', 'suggests', 'effects', 'used', 'bbc']","BINGE DRINKING DRINK CULTURE | Now just about every drink is available with an alcoholic twist to it.

Food addiction: could overeating be compulsive?,Alcoholism researcher Sally Marlow examines whether food addiction could be fuelling a rise in obesity,"['Sally Marlow', 'Addiction Researcher', 'Institute Of Psychiatry']",None,"Image copyright Science Photo Library

Scientists are divided over whether or not addiction could be contributing to rising global obesity. Does food addiction really exist and - if it does - how can it be treated?

Getting a grip on addiction can be incredibly hard, as anyone who has ever tried to give up smoking, alcohol or even caffeine will testify.

A tried and tested tactic is to avoid the thing you're addicted to - giving up going to pubs for a while, or not to have cigarettes in the house.

Even with these measures people often struggle and fail repeatedly.

But what if the thing you are addicted to has to be kept in the house, and worse, has to be something you sit down in front of three times a day?

As obesity levels continue to rise, the scientific community is starting to look for similarities between overeating and addiction.

The EU has funded a project called NeuroFAST to bring all the evidence together.

About the author Sally Marlow is an alcohol addiction researcher at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London. She has reported on alcohol for Radio 4's Today programme and for Inside Health

Researchers are cautious. So far there is only one type of eating disorder where it is thought addiction plays a role: Binge Eating Disorder, a side effect of which is often obesity.

Although we tend to trivialise the idea of addiction and food being related - many of us have at some point referred to ourselves as addicted to chocolate - Binge Eating Disorder is something which holds people within its grip.

It causes physical and psychological harm and is utterly miserable. Just like other forms of addiction.

One of the people I spoke to as part of my research, Michael, is an articulate, educated professional and a former overeater.

He said: ""It's difficult for others to understand. Everyone overeats and they think it's just a bigger version of that.

""It's a completely different experience - a constant, daily minute-to-minute obsession about getting the substance, food.

""It is hell being there in that place.""

Louise, another of those I met, provides a compelling testimony for addiction being at work in overeating.

She also had a serious alcohol problem and understands addiction more than most.

""I think what's most interesting is the similarities in behaviour,"" she says.

What is Binge Eating Disorder? A feeling of compulsion to overeat on a regular basis, sometimes including pre-planned binges

Those affected consume large amounts of food in a short time, often when they are not hungry

Overeating usually happens in private, leaving the person feeling out of control or guilty

The disorder is linked to obesity and conditions like high blood pressure and heart disease

Treatments include anti-depressants and cognitive therapies Source: NHS

""As an alcoholic I would go to different off-licences to buy my alcohol so people wouldn't recognise me, but I'd also go to different newsagents to buy chocolate so they wouldn't recognise me.

""Sneaking it into the house, not wanting people to see, hiding food, like an alcoholic hiding bottles, hiding empties.""

Dr Nora Volkow, a prominent neuroscientist and head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse in the United States, is clear in her mind that there are biological processes underpinning what Michael and Louise describe.

She has found that a neurotransmitter called dopamine, which is known to be involved in addiction, behaves in the brain in the same way in those who are heavily addicted to drugs and those who are obese.

For her this is strong evidence that food, or eating, can be addictive.

Not everybody agrees. Professor Jane Ogden, a psychologist at the University of Surrey, believes the label of addiction can be unhelpful for those who overeat - it removes personal responsibility and hinders recovery.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The number of obese people in the UK has more than trebled in 25 years

""The addiction world has given us a strong narrative that says you have no control - things in your brain are wanting more sugar or chocolate"" she says.

But if food is like other addictions, we should theoretically see overlaps in successful treatments.

Addiction treatment has a goal of either complete abstinence or reducing harm - for example by prescribing methadone or nicotine gum.

For those working towards abstinence, one tried and tested model is the 12-step programme developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, with versions for drugs used by Narcotics Anonymous and gambling by Gamblers Anonymous.

Twenty years ago people were reluctant to accept that gambling could be addictive, but now there is widespread acceptance of this idea

Michael and Louise are both members of Overeaters Anonymous. It works in much the same way as the other 12-step programmes with peer-led group confidential meetings, personal mentors, and a structured programme of steps to work through.

There is no doubt that for some it's highly successful, just like Alcoholics Anonymous can be.

It's not possible to abstain from eating, of course, but it is possible to abstain from overeating.

For Louise, abstinence is three healthy meals a day, no wheat and no chocolate. For Michael his abstinence food plan is determined by his sponsor - he is told by someone else what he is allowed to eat.

Other treatments are more radical.

In alcohol addiction, the body can be altered so that it rejects alcohol by implanting a drug known as antabuse.

If alcohol is consumed, the body reacts with nausea.

Similarly in overeating, the body can be altered by bariatric surgery - a gastric band, bypass or sleeve, which restricts the volume of the stomach available for food.

It sounds extreme but it works for most people, and the evidence shows the risks of surgery are far outweighed by the health benefits of losing excess weight.

People live longer, and have fewer heart and mobility problems. Diabetes is even reversed in some cases, and people report a massively improved quality of life.

The possible relationships between food and addiction are incredibly complicated, and there is a lot we do not yet understand.

Twenty years ago people were reluctant to accept that gambling could be addictive, but now there is widespread acceptance of this idea, and good evidence to support it.

Are we at the same place with food - waiting for the evidence and attitudes to change?

Nicola Schlesinger, a counsellor, works with women who have addiction problems and eating disorders. What would she say to those scientists who do not believe food can be addictive?

""They don't necessarily have the people sitting in front of them that I have on a daily basis in tears, in pain, hating themselves, feeling suicidal,"" she says.

""They can say what they like but in the end we still have to deal with the reality of the situation as it presents itself.""

Hopefully NeuroFAST and others will move us closer to narrowing the gap between scientists on both sides of the debate, and find solutions for people who do feel a compulsion to overeat.

Michael Le Vell: Street star's 'demons' laid bare in trial,"Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell is cleared of child sex offences, but his trial revealed the darker side of his personal life.",[],None,"Image caption Michael Le Vell was described in court as a ""heavy drinker [who] went out most nights""

Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell has been cleared of child sex abuse offences after a trial at Manchester Crown Court that lasted more than a week. On the steps of the court, after the jury had found him not guilty of 12 charges, his relief was obvious.

""I might go and have a drink now, believe it or not,"" was how Mr Le Vell finished his brief statement to the gathered media.

It was a remark that raised a laugh with his supporters but, as had been clear in the trial, it pointed to a dark side of the star's private life.

The 48-year-old actor, tried under his real name Michael Turner, had confessed his inner demons - alcoholism and adultery - during his time in the witness box.

'Troubled life'

The indication is clear that he is going back to Coronation Street and why not? Nigel Pivaro, Ex-Coronation Street actor

However, the star who plays Kevin Webster in the ITV soap maintained throughout he had never sexually assaulted or raped a child.

The judge had warned jurors not to confuse the man in the dock with his TV role as the car mechanic he has played for 30 years, watched by nine million viewers a week.

Mr Le Vell told the court his role had allowed him to live a ""luxury, charmed"" existence, but that on-screen fame hid what prosecutors said was a ""troubled"" life.

During cross-examination, he admitted he was an alcoholic and for 30 years had been ""drinking about seven or eight pints a night"" in the pub.

He told the court he had attended Alcoholics Anonymous ""one or two times"" but had given up on each occasion after just a few weeks.

In court, Mr Le Vell claimed his drinking was the result of his ""working-class mentality"" and confessed he had only been able to continue acting because his job had ""cocooned"" him.

'One-night stands'

The verdict came at the end of a trial which had seen the prosecutor remind the jury the case concerned neither Coronation Street's Kevin Webster nor Michael Le Vell.

Image caption Mr Le Vell has played garage mechanic Kevin Webster in the popular soap since 1983

""The man on trial is Michael Turner,"" chief prosecutor Eleanor Laws QC said.

During his trial, the jury heard how Mr Le Vell had cheated on his wife while she was undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer, in a parallel with his on-screen character, and he had had a string of one-night stands.

By coincidence, his character Kevin Webster had an affair with a character called Molly Dobbs while his on-screen wife, Sally Webster, developed breast cancer.

Such plot developments came a long time after Mr Turner started acting at school, aged 12, later becoming a member of Oldham Theatre Workshop, adopting the stage name of Le Vell along the way.

In 1981, he got his break, joining Coronation Street in a minor role for a few episodes. Two years later, he was cast as mechanic Kevin Webster.

As producers sought to win younger audiences Kevin and his two mates - bad-boy Terry Duckworth (played by Nigel Pivaro) and dreamer with intellectual pretensions Curly Watts (Kevin Kennedy) became a hit with fans.

Star's personal drama

Only Mr Le Vell has lasted in ""The Street"" and fans of the soap opera have followed his stormy relationship with Sally, played by Sally Dynevor.

Image caption Mr Le Vell's trial lasted seven days and ended with his acquittal on all charges

Such was his prominence, he had a major part in 2010's live 50th anniversary episode, which featured a fatal tram crash in Weatherfield, with his performance leading to a Best Actor nomination at the 2011 British Soap Awards.

Within months of that on-screen drama though, Mr Le Vell was dealing with his own crisis as he was arrested over child sex allegations.

He ""strenuously"" denied the claims and, after considering the case, the Crown Prosecution Service made the decision not to bring charges against him, in January 2012.

At the time, Mr Le Vell praised Greater Manchester Police for a ""fair, thorough and independent investigation"", adding that he was ""delighted to be completely exonerated"" by the decision to take no further action.

A year later however, the principal legal adviser to the Director of Public Prosecutions overturned the decision and brought a prosecution case against him.

'He's been exonerated'

Again, Mr Le Vell denied the accusations and said they were ""an absolute pack of lies"" which he would ""fight vigorously"".

During the trial, the prosecution put it to Mr Le Vell his witness box performance was just an act.

But a jury of eight women and four men did not believe he was acting and the actor left the court a free man.

His on-screen and off-screen friend Mr Pivaro sees no reason why Mr Le Vell cannot resume his Coronation Street career.

""I think the indication is clear that he is going back to Coronation Street and why not? He's been exonerated,"" said Mr Pivaro.

""We'll see, but let's face it, who amongst us can say that we are whiter than white, squeaky clean?

""Most of us have got skeletons in the cupboard of one kind or another but that doesn't make us criminals or sex offenders.""","['stars', 'webster', 'vell', 'trial', 'court', 'street', 'kevin', 'onscreen', 'michael', 'le', 'bare', 'laid', 'mr', 'demons']","Image caption Michael Le Vell was described in court as a ""heavy drinker [who] went out most nights""Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell has been cleared of child sex abuse offences after a trial at Manchester Crown Court that lasted more than a week.

I begged social services to take my children away,Sam spent more than 20 years as an addict before overcoming a cycle of trauma and abusive relationships.,[],None,"Sam spent more than 20 years as an addict, battling to get clean and sober. But she didn't want the methadone she was repeatedly prescribed by her local drugs service - she wanted to be abstinent. She tells Milly Chowles how she overcame a cycle of trauma and abusive relationships to beat her addictions by herself.

My husband didn't tell me it was heroin when he gave it to me to smoke. He told me it was cannabis resin. And then after about a week I really started to feel unwell.

There was a programme on the telly about a boy who had a habit and was withdrawing and I linked it to what I was experiencing. I woke my husband up in the middle of the night and absolutely went ballistic.

We had two children by then. I can remember saying: ""I don't want to do this no more, I don't want to go further,"" and begging him not to go and score. And he just didn't listen to me.

I remember just sitting in that front room watching him smoking, and feeling defeated.

The crack came in about a week later. I can remember watching him smoking it and he was going: ""Just try one, just try one,"" and I was like: ""No, no, I will never ever smoke that stuff,"" and I'd believe it when I was saying that.

But in the end I gave in, and I didn't stop for the best part of the next two decades.

It is a phenomenal force. It just takes over you.

I'd started shoplifting and offending, minor offences. I got arrested quite quickly and I went to prison.

My first sentence was only eight weeks, of which I served four. While I was there the children went into care for a little while. I managed to get them back when I came out, but two months later I'd been sectioned.

So I rang up social services from the psychiatric hospital and said: ""You need to go round to my house and take my children."" They'd been left with my husband who was using drugs - I knew they weren't safe. And they came, they took them, and they were adopted within a year. They never returned to my care again.

The adoption papers were signed while I was in prison. I'd gone from psychiatric hospital back on to the streets, back into prison. And that's how my life was for 15 years - in and out of psychiatric hospitals and in and out of prisons.

I can remember my last visit with my children and the obsession to use drugs was so strong that even as I took them down to the car, I was texting my dealer.

People say: ""Oh you'll find acceptance around it."" I accept that I was ill. And I can honestly say that would not have happened if I didn't have the substance in me. But it's something that I still haven't forgiven myself for. I don't know if I ever will.

I take full responsibility for my using and I don't blame my husband. I have an illness.

But addiction all comes down to relationships and being hurt again and again, and being left with no trust. I was always in a relationship and every relationship was dysfunctional. Every single one.

The really sad part of it is that I really thought these men loved me. When I began doing sex work they would sit and wait for me to get home and then they'd go to score with the money I'd just earned. Looking back now I really kick myself that I allowed that to happen - that I'd go out and let that stuff happen to me, and then give over my money and share what I'd just earned with somebody who didn't value me whatsoever.

How could they watch me go out there night after night, somebody who they're supposed to love and care about? I don't know how they could touch me after I'd gone and done that stuff.

One night I had a really bad experience. A punter raped me in his car. I just got out of that car. I didn't go home, I didn't tell my husband. I went back out and I found another punter. I don't remember much of the night but I remember those two punters.

I went straight back out again because of the obsession to use more drugs. I needed the money. It's that powerful. That's the control drugs had over me.

In the end I met somebody else while my husband was in prison, serving a long sentence. I went from this co-dependent using relationship to a very violent abusive relationship. The progression with each relationship, it just got worse. And again I stayed.

Once he headbutted me, to the point that I passed out. When I came round the first thing I said was, ""Oh, give me a cuddle please."" And I'm the one saying sorry for something I haven't done. Absolutely nuts.

I stayed in that relationship for about eight years.

It wasn't the heroin or crack that brought me to my knees in the end, it was the alcohol.

The two children from my second relationship had gone off to live with family. I was isolated in a flat on my own and my life for 18 months was waking up, and getting as much Tennent's Super in me as I could. Some days I was too frightened to go out the door and get my methadone script - I would rather sit there and withdraw as long as I had the Tennent's.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How ""Sam"" was introduced to drugs by her husband.

I couldn't even open the curtains in the end. Couldn't take sunlight on my face. I did not want to be in any type of reality at all.

I despised myself, absolutely despised myself.

My friend Pat died six days before I was due to go into rehab. I can remember just smashing my flat up. I must have been screaming so loudly that my neighbours rang the police and the police kicked my door in.

I was on my front-room floor, screaming that I didn't want to die. I'd never had a policeman hug me, but one of them hugged me. I must have looked such a mess.

I think it was in that moment I knew I'd had enough, I'd really had enough of it.

I'd been fighting to get into recovery for a long time. There were three different treatment centres and numerous detoxes along the way. But in May 2014 I went off to a treatment centre in Weston-super-Mare. I was so angry when I got there that they put me on a behavioural contract almost immediately. They said if I didn't conform to it and stop arguing with everyone, that I would be discharged. I looked at this contract one night and thought: ""I'm not going to be able to do this."" And I knew if I got discharged I'd use. So I decided to take control and made a decision to leave of my own accord.

I was still heavily scripted on methadone and valium, I hadn't finished my alcohol detox. And I told them I was going. And they said: ""Where are you going?"" And I said I was going to a Narcotics Anonymous meeting in London. And they looked at me like I was an absolute lunatic. And I probably was, a bit.

It was a big leap of faith. I was homeless because I couldn't go back to my flat because of bail conditions. I went to a meeting in Soho in London. And I sat in that meeting and I asked for help and that's what I got.

Three people in that meeting aren't with us any more, they're dead. I really do grasp how lucky I am.

After nearly 20 years of addiction and in drugs and alcohol services, the services didn't help me stop using. In fact, if anything I feel they kept me using longer with methadone prescriptions. They never once mentioned mutual aid groups. Their answer every time was more medication, never abstinence.

I stopped my script dead and I got clean in the meetings. And I am proud of that.

This month I will have been clean for three-and-a-half years.

Help with addiction

It's not been easy. I got made homeless six months ago which was really frightening, really scary. It was an on-the-spot eviction, I was asked to leave straight away. I didn't know where I was going. I didn't know what I was doing. But I got through it and I stayed clean.

I have complex PTSD, which I put down to to the sex working I did during my addiction. It affects every area of my life because I am so easily triggered. But I'm determined to recover from it. I didn't come into recovery to be like this. But it's manageable. I manage it, to get by.

I'm rebuilding a relationship with my oldest two children, and this Christmas was the first time I've had my daughter with me since 2012.

I now run women's recovery groups in a day centre and I'm doing well at college - I left school when I was 13.

No, I don't have a flat. No, I'm not in full-time employment. I'm living in a hostel, which is challenging at times, very challenging. But every time I look out my window and it's raining, gratitude just comes over me that I haven't got to go out in that rain and wait for a punter to come and pick me up.

It's not perfect at the minute, it's not great. But… it's all right. Life's all right.

We're devoting almost all our programme tonight to Boozenight.

This is not an attempt to put you off your Christmas cheer. Most of us in the Newsnight office like a glass or two. Or three. Or more. And that's where the problem comes.

Many of us have been shocked how our own drinking consumption appears to mount up. Shocked too at the state of our streets on a Friday and Saturday night.

And surprised at the findings of our opinion poll, specially commissioned for the programme, which demonstrates clearly that as a nation we are worried about booze - indeed we think it more harmful to our society than heroin or cocaine, and a majority of us want the drinking age raised to 21.

It's all very interesting, provocative and disturbing, and it kicks off with the award winning film maker Paul Watson going back to the four alcoholics he filmed seeking treatment in hospital. What has happened to them in their difficult journey - they hoped - towards sobriety?

Shot Chelsea lawyer Mark Saunders 'asked for his wife',The widow of a barrister who was shot dead by police during a stand-off tells an inquest she could have defused the situation.,[],None,"Image caption Mr Saunders' family say he posed no real risk to the public

The widow of an alcoholic barrister who was shot dead by police during a stand-off told an inquest she could have defused the situation.

Mark Saunders, 32, was hit in the head and chest by five police bullets at his Chelsea home in May 2008.

Elizabeth Saunders told Westminster Coroner's Court: ""I know that Mark would never, ever have hurt me.""

Mr Saunders asked negotiators if he could speak to his wife, but she said police told her to turn her phone off.

Mrs Saunders, also a barrister at QEB chambers, said that her husband told their senior clerk he had been ""firing his gun and that the police were coming and he was in trouble"" in a phone call shortly before 1700 BST.

Blank text

She made her way home but was stopped at the police cordon. Officers then asked her to switch off her mobile phone.

She said she heard a ""lot of commotion"" but did not know her husband was dead until 2230 BST.

Later when she switched on her phone, she found a blank text from him.

Image caption Mark Saunders' family say he posed no risk to the public

Mrs Saunders said: ""That would have been the only time in our relationship that he sent me a text message and he did not get an immediate call from me saying, 'Darling, I am here'.

""That is very difficult for me, but there it is. I did not know he had called.""

She told the inquest: ""The truth of our relationship was Mark and I loved each other.

""I think he would have just said 'Darling, I am sorry'. And I would have said 'Sweetheart, it is OK. Do not worry, we will sort this out'.""

The inquest also heard that Mr Saunders had texted Alex Booth, the best man at his wedding, during the stand-off.

The message said: ""This is the end, my only friend, the end.""

Mr Booth told the court they would often quote films and music to each other, and the message appeared to be quoting from a song by The Doors used in the film Apocalypse Now.

The hearing was told Mr Saunders had been attending Alcoholics Anonymous and sought help from his GP to control his drinking.

The family law expert had been prescribed anti-depressants and had also taken cocaine in the months leading up to his death.

'Love for life'

Mrs Saunders said she thought he had been drinking heavily on the day of his killing.

She said her husband was a ""very sensitive and caring man"" with ""huge energy and love for life"".

Mrs Saunders said he had been teetotal apart from a few ""blips"".

She said: ""There were occasions, probably every three months or so, when it went wrong.""

On the day of his death Mr Saunders had been out on various errands and seemed ""very happy"".

Cab driver David Hay, who dropped him later in the day, told the inquest: ""He looked straight at me, and just said, 'I'm going to die'.""

The death of Mr Saunders, who was once in the Territorial Army, was filmed from a police helicopter.

Police had been called after neighbours saw him firing a shotgun into a neighbouring flat.

The officers say they were firing in self-defence, or to protect others.

None of them is to be prosecuted, the Crown Prosecution Service has said.

Mr Saunders' family maintain he presented no risk to the public.

'I woke up with Kevin Spacey lying on me',A man tells the Victoria Derbyshire programme the Hollywood star groomed him in the mid-1980s.,[],None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The man, who did not want to be identified, says he woke up with Spacey's head on his stomach

A man has said he was left traumatised after waking up to find Hollywood star Kevin Spacey lying on him when he was a teenager in the 1980s.

The man told Victoria Derbyshire Spacey invited him to spend the weekend in New York but it became clear he was interested in ""a way I wasn't"".

He said Spacey asked him to share his bed, but he slept on the sofa and woke up with the actor's arms around him.

The BBC has contacted Spacey for a comment.

John, not his real name, added he didn't believe anything sexual took place, but said: ""I was uncomfortable at best, traumatised at worst.""

Image copyright AFP Image caption Kevin Spacey is a double Oscar winner and was artistic director at London's Old Vic for 11 years

The latest allegation follows Spacey's apology after US actor Anthony Rapp accused him of making a sexual advance towards him when he was 14.

Rapp told how Spacey laid down on top of him in a bedroom during a party at the older man's flat in 1986.

The Double Oscar-winner said he was ""beyond horrified"" to hear the story and did not remember the encounter.

Other men have now come forward, accusing Spacey of sexual harassment.

US filmmaker Tony Montana told Radar Online he suffered from PTSD for six months after Spacey allegedly grabbed his crotch in a Los Angeles bar in 2003.

And Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos, who acted in several plays at the Old Vic, claimed in a Facebook post Spacey ""routinely preyed"" on young male actors.

'Hand on thigh'

Speaking to the programme, John said he first met the Broadway actor in 1984 at a summer theatre when he was 16.

The pair exchanged letters and, a year later, when John was 17, Spacey invited him to spend a weekend at his home in New York City.

John told how a ""charming and brotherly"" Spacey showed him around the city, took him out for dinner and introduced him to famous friends on their weekend together.

On the first evening, Spacey talked a lot about his work and became affectionate ""in a way I certainly wasn't interested in"", he said.

He put his hand on John's thigh, an arm around his shoulder and rubbed his arm.

'Icy goodnight'

At bedtime, John said Spacey asked him to share his bed, but John insisted on sleeping on the sofa.

""It was an icy 'goodnight' with the lights off. I thought I was going to be kicked out in the morning,"" he said.

""As we went to sleep, he was sobbing from his bed,"" said John.

He said he felt it was attention-seeking behaviour in an attempt to get him to respond.

The following morning, John said he woke up with Spacey's head on his stomach and his arms wrapped around him.

""He was in his underwear, I was fully clothed. I supposed it was some sort of New York theatre actor 'good morning,'"" he said.

'Stupid or predatory'

After a second day enjoying New York, John said once back at the flat, Spacey became affectionate again and told him he felt ""misunderstood"".

""I burst into tears because I couldn't articulate any more what was happening to me. I was scared,"" said John.

""To his credit, he backed off and we went to sleep.""

John said he is telling his story now after reading about Rapp's similar experience and he wants young people to know they should be vigilant and speak out.

""It seems he was grooming me,"" John said.

""For me, I never let on that that's what I was interested in. I never discussed it, nor did I want it.

""I was uncomfortable at best, traumatised at worst.

""He was either very stupid or predatory - or maybe a little of both.""

John points out that neither of them drank any alcohol that weekend.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Anthony Rapp, now 46, appeared in Star Trek: Discovery

He said he didn't tell his parents or the authorities at the time because he thought Spacey's behaviour might have been ""permissible"" and worried he might have ""given off a vibe"" that he was interested in Spacey.

The BBC is seeking a response from Spacey.

In light of Rapp's allegations, Netflix has suspended production of political drama, House of Cards, in which Spacey stars.

Meanwhile, the Old Vic, a London theatre where Spacey worked for 11 years, has set up a confidential complaints process for people involved with the theatre.","['woke', 'theatre', 'john', 'york', 'spacey', 'spaceys', 'kevin', 'lying', 'told', 'actor', 'interested', 'weekend']","He said Spacey asked him to share his bed, but he slept on the sofa and woke up with the actor's arms around him.

"Ulster Bank: Man jailed for stealing £11,000 from faulty ATM","A recovering alcoholic is jailed for four months for stealing £11,000 from a faulty Ulster Bank cash machine.",[],None,"Image copyright PA Image caption A prosecution lawyer told Downpatrick Crown Court that on June 22, 2012, Ulster Bank had 'experienced a computer malfunction in its system'

A recovering alcoholic has been jailed for four months for stealing £11,000 from a faulty Ulster Bank cash machine.

A judge told Peter Anthony Young, 58, of Hunter's Way, Ardglass, that he had ""deliberately taken advantage'' of the major glitch in the bank's system almost four years ago.

It meant customers could withdraw funds from ATM machines without affecting their balance.

Following a check, the bank discovered the money had been withdrawn by Young.

A prosecution lawyer told Downpatrick Crown Court that on 22 June 2012, Ulster Bank had ""experienced a computer malfunction in its system''.

""Following a check, Ulster Bank discovered that Young, who was one of its customers, had £11,000 withdrawn from his account on that day,'' said Ms Ivers.

The judge was told there had been 22 separate withdrawals of £500 on the day in question.

The prosecution lawyer said the bank made repeated attempts to contact Young without success before eventually reporting the incident to police as ""fraudulent''.

The PSNI started an investigation and Young voluntarily attended a police station and admitted making the withdrawals, telling police he had ""spent the money on drink''.

The prosecution lawyer said the accused, who was a customer of the Ulster Bank, had ""made no effort to pay back the funds'' and the outstanding balance he owed now stood at £10,908.40.

A defence lawyer described it as an ""unusual case'' and said that when Young was interviewed by police in September 2014 he made ""frank admissions'' to his crimes.

""Reading between the lines from the court papers, it appears Mr Young was in the company of other people drinking with them that day and when he was taking money out it became apparent to him and the others that there was a fault with this machine,"" he told the court.

""This was always going to come home to him.

'Downward spiral'

""He is not in the least blaming others.''

The defence lawyer said that Young's life had ""taken a downward spiral'' following the death of his mother in 1991 and said that by the age of 34 he was an alcoholic, homeless and ""living on the streets of Belfast''.

The lawyer added that the father-of-five was now a recovering alcoholic, who was attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, was part of a church group and was also attending a rehabilitation programme.

The defence lawyer said Young could be made the subject of a community order which ""would leave something hanging over his head that would remind him not to stray from the straight and narrow again''.

""I would urge the court to give him a chance to continue to improve himself,'' the lawyer added.

The judge said Young had gone to the machine on one occasion to withdraw £500 on the day in question.

""He chose to return to this machine a further 21 times to withdraw the money when he knew he did not have the funds in his account,"" he said.

""He knew full well what he was doing and he deliberately took advantage of the defective ATM.""

The judge said Young, who is living on social security benefits, had not repaid any money he had stolen from the Ulster Bank.

""I don't believe I could deal with this case by way of a suspended sentence. The least sentence I can impose is one of four months in custody.''","['day', 'money', 'faulty', 'bank', 'prosecution', 'ulster', 'lawyer', 'judge', 'court', 'told', 'young', 'man', 'stealing', '11000', 'jailed', 'atm']","Image copyright PA Image caption A prosecution lawyer told Downpatrick Crown Court that on June 22, 2012, Ulster Bank had 'experienced a computer malfunction in its system'A recovering alcoholic has been jailed for four months for stealing £11,000 from a faulty Ulster Bank cash machine.

"Drinking, sex, eating: Why don't we tell the truth in surveys?",Many people are under-reporting how much alcohol they are drinking. But what else are we fibbing to researchers about and why do we do it?,"['Brian Wheeler', 'Bbc News Magazine']",None,"Many people are under-reporting how much alcohol they are drinking. But what else are we fibbing to researchers about and why do we do it?

""I have the occasional sweet sherry. Purely medicinal.""

It is a classic British sitcom scene. An inveterate boozer telling a little white lie about how much they drink to a doctor or other authority figure.

But the tendency to paint a less-than-honest picture about your unhealthy habits and lifestyle is not just restricted to alcohol. People also tend to kid themselves about how much exercise they are doing.

It is understandable that people want to present a positive image of themselves to friends, family and colleagues. But why fib to researchers?

After all, the man or woman from the Office for National Statistics or Ipsos Mori can't order you to go on a diet or lay off the wine.

It is a question that has been puzzling social scientists for decades.

They even have a name for it - The Social Desirability Bias.

""People respond to surveys in the way they think they ought to. It is otherwise known as lying,"" says Kate Fox, an alcohol and drinking culture expert who has done research for both the government and the drinks industry.

Image caption The recycling never lies

""People also kid themselves about how much they drink, but it applies to most surveys, which is why one has to use other methods to really find out what is going on.""

It is a particular problem when it comes to ""sins"" such as alcohol and food.

Britain is one of a handful of nations - including the US - that has an ""ambivalent drinking culture"", says Fox. It is particularly prevalent in countries that have had a strong temperance movement.

People respond to surveys in the way they think they ought to - it is otherwise known as lying Kate Fox

""We have a morally charged relationship with alcohol, a love/hate relationship. It is a bit of a forbidden fruit.""

In countries with an ""integrated drinking culture"", such as more Latin nations, drinking is a ""morally neutral issue, only marginally more controversial than coffee and tea"".

It is easy to see why people would want to make themselves look good - even to a clipboard-wielding researcher they have just met.

But what about when the researcher leaves the room? Or hands them a separate questionnaire to be filled in privately? They're all tactics used by researchers to try and iron out the Social Desirability Bias.

""You still want to project a positive image of yourself even if the survey is anonymous,"" says Bobby Duffy, managing director of Ipsos Mori's Social Research Institute.

The gap between the amount of alcohol being sold in the UK and the amount people said they were drinking, was first observed in the 1980s, he says.

More from the Magazine ""The news is chock full of surveys. Many are blatant self-promotion and/or statistical garbage. When a women's magazine reports a survey of the nation's sexual habits, you might wonder whether it's really what the people of Great Britain are up to, or just a good way of selling a magazine."" What the survey didn't say (5 August 2008)

""People have unrealistic expectations about what other people are doing and that does affect how they how they respond.

""They think other people are drinking a lot less alcohol, doing more exercise and having a lot more sex and that changes their view of their own behaviour.""

The gap between perception and reality might be particularly acute in the UK, he suggests.

Awareness of healthy eating in the UK is among the highest in Europe, yet the country also has the highest obesity rates.

The key, says Duffy, is to view survey results as part of a bigger picture - and, he stresses, it is still possible to track overall social trends from self-reported surveys.

But if people underestimate how much they drink, do they overestimate how often they have sex?

The sex survey has been a surefire way to boost the circulation of a newspaper or magazine for decades.

Yet there is anxiety among sexual researchers that they are not as accurate as they should be.

Image caption Surveys can overestimate how often couples have sex

""In a large number of these surveys people inflate how often they have sex. They are buying into this idea that great sex is measured by how often you have it,"" says Petra Boynton, senior lecturer in International Health Care Research at University College London.

""We do have an anxiety about trusting sex research generally, partly because of worries over talking about sex but recently more because of the misuse of the survey tool as an advertising device.

It is hardly surprising, she says, that journalists and the public don't trust sex research:

""What they see shared in mainstream media is not the careful and more balanced work undertaken in social and health research.

""As sex stories on relationships advice in media are pinned on 'statistics', then this allows the dodgy PR polls to be used to tell us how we should be having sex and set up ideas about what is normal.""

"Letter from America by Alistair Cooke, New Year's Resolutions",transcript,[],None,"And warm good wishes for a Happy New Year wherever you are or - quickly remembering my political correctness - perhaps I should say wherever 1st January is the beginning of your New Year.

Every New Year's Eve there's a scene in New York's Times Square that's been going on for ever and one that's now watched by Americans across the country who are respectively an hour behind New York or two hours, on the coast three hours. Here I've dug out a description of the scene a year or two ago, which describes not only New York's famous ball of light, but records what used to be a compulsory chore for journalists, a sampling of the commonest New Year's resolutions. Here it is.

""The clocks struck the hour and the great ball of 450 incandescent bulbs glowed and then fell from the mast head of the Times building in New York City. Not long after first light tomorrow regiments of women would be out invading the January sales rustling among tidal waves of silk crpe de Chine, picking up bargains in Albatross boudoir jackets and non-bargains in French silk stockings. All across the country, men would renew the usual annual resolutions to stay away from the pool room, to learn hypnotism, to buy a Madelette, no plates, no films, no fuss, picture taken and finished on the spot in less than a minute, to abandon what they call the drink habit, to learn shorthand in 30 days, to buy a wireless practise set in order to learn the Morse code, to invest in a John Deere plough, to take one of those correspondence school courses and earn more money. I tell you what's holding you down, Jim, best of all the most widespread of all American resolutions of the time to get fat, which is what all the advertisements promised, let us make you fat. At our own risk we offer to put 10, 15, yes 30 pounds of good solid stay-there flesh on your bones.""

Well, you must have already been brought up short by the all American resolutions of the time, of what time? Of New Year's Day 1915 - that's what I was describing. Of all those quaint resolutions I think there's probably only one that still stands, the admirable sad determination probably due to fail to give up the drink habit. I discovered, by the way, that by the end of this year, it will have been just 60 years since two American men, drinking buddies, took a pledge to shake the habit; the important thing about their pledge was that they took it together and had a new idea about how to keep it. If either of them as the weeks and months of their abstinence went along, if either of them felt himself slipping or aching for a drink, he was call to the other who promised to arrive at once like a nurse and see his pal through, as they say, through it the throes of temptation.

The man who had this idea was known until he died as Bill W. He hoped to recruit others, many others into this routine and he promised to do it on the understanding that their identity would never be published, they would be anonymous that was the beginning in 1935 of Alcoholics Anonymous.

Now at that time in this country, I remember in New Haven, Connecticut, Yale University had a pioneering department of so-called alcoholic studies; it was run by a psychiatrist and both before and after it was the educated consensus that an alcoholic's best hope of cure was through psychiatric treatment. I suppose Europe too had its clinics, it certainly shared the general presumption about the value of psychiatry. I knew the man who was in charge at Yale and after a few years he confessed that while their studies could detail symptoms and the clinical course of the disease and could elaborate theories about causes, well he was an honest man and admitted they were producing no cures. Soon afterwards, he shut up shop.

Of course, all the psychiatrists had heard of Alcoholics Anonymous and its methods and it's fair to say that at that time among most double-domed psychiatrists AA was derided as a rather maudlin method, a sentimental routine. Bill W at once admitted as much, he nailed the psychiatrists, the Freudians especially on their own ground with their favourite doctrine, that most deep human impulses are childlike and that chronic drunkenness has much to do with the protest against a lack of affection. Well, said Bill W, we make it up to them, we give it to them at the moment they most need it.

Very soon, I should say by the 1950s, psychiatrists no longer claimed to be able to cure alcoholism and grudgingly admitted that AA worked as it does and has gone on doing. There was at the time, one famous intellectual who might, you might have guessed would be certain to back the psychiatrists and despise AA as rather vulgar stuff but, no, he saw it working from the start on good friends and when Bill W died and his identity was revealed as William ""Bill"" Wilson all of us actually called him the greatest social architect of our time.

Among all the other resolutions, I don't suppose anybody today is vowing to learn shorthand in 30 days or 30 years or learn the Morse code but the one resolution I'm positive no American swore to in the waning hours of 1993 was the last one I noted, ""we promise we can make you fat with good stay-there flesh on your bones"". Heavens to Betsy.

When I came on that 1915 advertisement, I turned the page and faced an accompanying illustration. I'm looking at it now, it shows a handsome muscular man sitting tailor fashion on the beach beside what was then called a deep bosomed fine figure of a woman, say 160 pounds, 11-12 stone, they were both wearing what were known as bathing costumes. She's looking over to him and pointing to two skeletons up the beach. Today, they'd look normal enough and she's saying ""gee look at that pair of skinny scarecrows, why don't they try and then the brand name of the stuff that came in box costing 50¢, first box free, if you didn't gain 10 pounds in the first week or two, money back"". Don't you wonder what it could possibly be? All it says in the fine print blurb is that this treatment increases the red corpuscles in the blood, strengthens the nerves and puts the digestive tract into such shape that food is assimilated, imagine and turned into good solid healthy flesh.

Today, the ad would more likely echo Hamlet and show you how this too too solid flesh could be made to melt. That ad and that dieting mania was published as I say in 1915. Ten years later, certainly by the mid '20s, the ideal female figure in Britain as well as America had changed dramatically. I never know who dictates these things, I suppose the fashion designers in order to stay solvent have to change the ideal shape drastically at regular intervals so that you can't just take in a tuck or two, you have to buy completely new clothes.

Well, by 1925, it was decreed that the deep bosomed woman should not only loose her depth, she should have no bosom at all and take off at the very least those 30 pounds her mother had put on. And so in that curious absolutely dependable way that life imitates art everywhere suddenly young women of all classes except the very poor and the very old and rich had flat chests, short skirts above legs without calves, bobbed hair and were in 10 years more radically different looking from their mothers than any two generations have been since.

Shortly after the First War was over, a word came into the language and a dieting practice that swept Britain. The practice but not the word did the same in the United States, it was Banting. I used to think this probably derived from the Canadian doctor Frederick Banting who discovered co-discovered insulin, but no. Mr Banting was a London cabinet maker who came to fame rather late in life. By the 1920s he was crowding 60, he had a theory how to take off that stay there fat, how in fact to slim, avoid all fats, starches and sugar hence ""to bant"" became the fashion first with society women and very soon with all women and ever since dieting has meant taking flesh off not putting it on to stay there.

There was a report, however, a so-called survey came out last weekend announcing a new trend called pleasure revenge, a fad for defying all the good rules we've learned through the years about cigarettes, caffeine, fatty foods. This defiance takes the form of choosing high-fat snacks, of putting on a couple of pounds instead of losing 10. And who conducted this survey? A marketing vice president and a professor of psychology whose specialty is studying New Year's resolutions. He finds that neither losing weight nor stopping smoking was the number one resolution among, he says, a lot of people; he doesn't say how many over how many years they were studied. In fact, the last thing that's indicated by this so-called survey is a scientific study; the professor calls the movement a backlash against the last decade's relentless beating of the health drum. Don't believe it. It says here, quote, ""representatives of the dairy, beef, pork, sugar, snack food, fast food and tobacco industries view the recent survey with enthusiasm"". You can believe that.

Plus opera singer Renee Fleming and the impact of alcoholic parents on their children.

On 21 January there will be a Women's March on Washington. The march is not billed as an anti-Trump protest, but as a stand on a range of social justice and human rights issues. Many other marches are taking place across the world including two in the UK. We discuss.

It is estimated that one in five children are affected by their parents drinking. We hear the experience of a listener with two young children who is trying to manage and support her 73-year-old alcoholic father and we consider the impact on children of alcoholic parents and look at what support is available?

American Opera singer Renee Fleming joins Jane. She is in the UK performing at the Royal Opera House in London and has just released her latest album which includes both classical music and re-versioned Bjork tracks.

It's New Year resolution time but instead of diets and dry Januaries, we're looking into developing good habits. We kick off with altruism.

Blandford crash death girl's mum 'hid alcoholism',"Agencies were alerted to Alanda Pike's drinking before the fatal crash but ""key links"" were missed.",[],None,"Image copyright Dorset Police Image caption Alanda Pike's blood alcohol level was three-and-a-half times the legal limit

A mother who killed her three-year-old daughter in a crash while drunk was an alcoholic with a history of drinking and driving, a report has found.

Louisa Pike was fatally injured in the crash on the A354 near Blandford, Dorset, in August last year.

Alanda Pike was jailed for six years and four months for causing her death.

Dorset Safeguarding Children Board (DSCB) said different agencies had been involved with the family but ""key links"" were not made.

The serious case review - which referred to Louisa as ""Child S"" - said Pike had concealed her alcoholism, but while pregnant in 2014 she was banned from driving after being caught four times over the drink-drive limit.

Vodka and cocaine

In April 2016, police were also called when a ""heavily intoxicated"" Pike dropped her baby in a supermarket, the report said.

It said police received anonymous calls claiming Pike was driving while drunk and, on one occasion, she was reported for failing to stop after hitting a cyclist, but a lack of evidence meant no action was taken.

The report said the girl's preschool raised concerns but social workers found the girl ""happy and talkative"".

Early on 24 August 2017, Pike crashed into a van at Thickthorn Cross, seriously injuring the driver. Her daughter was airlifted to hospital with head injuries but died the next day.

Pike admitted causing death and serious injury by dangerous driving and driving with excess alcohol.

Bournemouth Crown Court heard she had drunk half a 200ml bottle of vodka and had been drinking and taking cocaine the previous evening.

The report said some issues highlighted in the review had already improved including the introduction of a single point of contact for safeguarding concerns.

It said midwives were also expected to gather history in the early stages of pregnancy.

Independent chairwoman Sarah Elliott said: ""Although different agencies had been involved with the mother at different times, key links were not being made.

""It really does bring home the need for professionals to be curious and share information with one another, so they can consider the whole picture to help keep children safe.""","['death', 'alcoholism', 'review', 'different', 'report', 'driving', 'mum', 'drunk', 'crash', 'times', 'girls', 'safeguarding', 'mother', 'hid', 'blandford', 'pike', 'serious']","Louisa Pike was fatally injured in the crash on the A354 near Blandford, Dorset, in August last year.

Ruby Wax is 'Losing it' at the Edinburgh Fringe,Comedian Ruby Wax's Edinburgh Fringe show looks for laughs in the story of her mental illness.,"['Steven Brocklehurst', 'Bbc Scotland News Website']",None,"Image caption Ruby Wax has been touring the show around psychiatric hospitals

Ruby Wax is mentally ill.

""But at least I got a show out of it,"" she tells the audience with her trademark glibness.

Losing it, playing at the Underbelly during the Edinburgh Fringe, is Wax's examination of her own breakdown and her thoughts on what led her to it.

The 58-year-old maintains the hyperactive, self-centred, wisecracking persona which she developed over three decades in the spotlight but there is also a more honest and vulnerable Wax telling a personal story.

Wax shares the details of her own clinical depression and her trips to the Priory and confronts the stigma and shame of mental illness.

""The show is comedy,"" she says.

""It is hilarious. I don't talk about raising awareness but at one point I see the audience start nodding their heads and they are saying 'I got that too'.

""But you don't have to be mentally ill to get what I'm talking about.""

""I have always been interested in psychology,"" Wax says.

She studied the subject at the University of California at Berkeley before running away to Glasgow to study acting.

""Acting became a job and I always said 'at some time I am going to go back and study this'.""

It is like finding out you are not possessed by the devil Ruby Wax

She is currently studying for a Masters degree in ""mindfulness-based cognitive therapy"" at Oxford.

Wax says that understanding the way the brain functions takes the fear away.

""It is like finding out you are not possessed by the devil,"" she says.

During the show, she delivers a cod-lecture on the science of the brain.

Careful not to be too serious, she steers away from neuroscience but her message is clear.

""Mental illness is a disease like diabetes, it cannot just be wished away.""

Wax has been performing the show, alongside her friend Judith Owen, for more than a year in hospitals and psychiatric units.

She says performing in psychiatric hospitals is the ""biggest thrill"" but she wants to reach out to the ""lost tribe"" of sufferers and carers.

'Got it made'

""My people,"" as she calls them.

Wax and Owen, who plays piano and sings snatches of songs which try to encapsulate the feelings the comedian is describing, will take the show to London's West End after its Edinburgh run.

Wherever they go they hold forums which discuss mental health issues such as the effectiveness of drugs and also seek to put people in touch with help and support.

Later in the year, Wax will unveil a website called blackdogtribe.com.

Wax says the website will have chat rooms and it will be very visual because much of the mental health literature can be very hard to read.

She hopes it will create a mental health brand which is something like Alcoholic Anonymous, where people form a network of support for each other.

""Those alcoholics have got it made,"" she quips.

Molly Parkin: Fashioning her own career,"Molly Parkin speaks of her life as a fashion editor, painter, alcoholic and explains how her father's abuse affected her some 70 years later.","['Mario', 'Bbc News']",None,"Image caption Molly Parkin lives in sheltered accommodation in Chelsea but says she prefers it to her 51 previous homes

""It isn't what you've done that you regret, it's what you haven't done,"" says Molly Parkin.

Based on that premise, it must be rather hard for her to have any regrets at all.

Self-proclaimed national treasure, painter, former agony aunt, award-winning fashion editor, theatre performer, erotic author with a dizzying string of former lovers, this 78-year-old has detailed some of her exploits in a memoir, Welcome to Mollywood.

Her own motto for dressing is to rise each morning and ""throw on whatever's nearest, just as long as it clashes"" and it was this life-long extravagant style that led her to catch the eye of the fashion world.

It was searing, that experience of writing about [my abuse], so much so I had to have a bucket in order to vomit into as I wrote Molly Parkin

In 1964, faced with a lull in her painting career, she was courted by Nova magazine, becoming its fashion editor, before moving on to Harpers and Queen in 1967 and then the Sunday Times in 1969.

Voted fashion editor of the year in 1971, just one of several awards from the fashion world, she quit the industry soon after, turning down many high-profile offers to return elsewhere, leaving it behind forever.

""Fashion was never my world, it's a cruel and superficial world. I never liked it, I wasn't happy in it, although they lauded me with all the distinctions and awards. It wasn't a world I wanted to be in. It was a relief when I left it.""

Such was her unease with the fashion industry that she quit the first two editorial posts without any financial compensation, and worked without a contract at the Sunday Times. Her wayward dealings with money would come back to haunt her.

She was given a chunky, red plastic desk by the Sunday Times when she left, which she still uses now. The adjacent wall is covered with pictures of friends, family and David Beckham in his pants.

Image caption Molly was made fashion editor of the Sunday Times in 1969

Molly is brimming with gripping anecdotes of working with the great and good, but her experiences are underpinned by much darker elements, including her sexual abuse by her father, which she kept a secret until she was in her 60s.

The unflinching detail of her father's behaviour towards her as a child, which she describes in her book, makes for painful and uncomfortable reading, along with the physical beatings he often administered. It's a difficult process for both reader and author.

""It was searing, that experience of writing about it, so much so I had to have a bucket in order to vomit into as I wrote,"" she says.

""And even that physical exorcism of him was a healing process. The writing of this book has allowed me to come to total compassion and forgiveness for this man.""

She nimbly nips around her cluttered flat, mainly one large room in sheltered accommodation in London's Chelsea, where she has lived since going bankrupt several years ago, the latest of the 52 homes she has lived in as an adult.

The greatest movement now in fashion is Primark, because of the cheapness, although the place horrifies some people Molly Parkin

The place is full of large piles of books, paintings, ornaments, clothes, and all sorts of stuff, with shoes lurking and leaping out to trip any feet navigating the narrow walkways between it all.

She has covered everything in beautiful, if eye-watering, colourful throws, creating richly-explosive mounds all over the small space. It's rather like being inside a melted rainbow.

As she makes a herbal tea in her tiny kitchen, she introduces a large Madonna, two Buddhas and some other religious artefacts, in what she describes as her ""spiritual corner"".

Born in the mining village of Pontycymmer, south Wales, in 1932, she talks of once living in mansions, being showered in gifts by rich lovers, including a vintage Rolls Royce from the year of her birth, bestowed by ""a besotted aristo"".

But all that has now gone, her boutique on the King's Road in Chelsea and her Belgravia restaurant merely distant memories. But at least she managed to conquer the demons of her drinking.

""I used to go to three Alcohol Anonymous meetings a day, just to keep out of the bars,"" she says, now dry for the past 24 years.

She also puts her many fiancees partly down to her alcoholic haze.

""I don't know whatever made people think I'd make good wife material, or that their mothers would like me. They would always invite me over for tea, and then I wouldn't hear from that boy again,"" she chuckles.

Image caption Molly (right) is seen here in her Chelsea art studio in 1961

""I did sit down and started to count the fiancees I'd had. I got to 18 and I thought 'Oh, stop it Moll'.

""You must remember I was a boozer, darling. At the end of the second date - sometimes the first - the person would say 'I'm passionately in love with you Molly, will you marry me?'

""Because I was drunk I'd say: 'That sounds fun.'""

And what of modern fashion? After working with photoshoot budgets that warranted security guards to watch over the precious gems she'd ordered from Bond Street jewellers, what catches her eye now?

""I don't see anything enthralling in the fashion reportage now, not as I did, breaking new ground.

""I like to see fashion seeping all down to youngsters. The greatest movement now in fashion is Primark, because of the cheapness, although the place horrifies some people.""

She also extols the virtues of street markets and buying from charity shops, whose clothes she cuts up to make her own garments, ""because you're helping charities and I like the concept of that.""

She adds: ""I am a humanitarian. Above and beyond even humanitarian, a humanist is what I am.""","['chelsea', 'fashion', 'writing', 'parkin', 'times', 'place', 'career', 'large', 'id', 'fashioning', 'molly', 'editor', 'world']","Image caption Molly Parkin lives in sheltered accommodation in Chelsea but says she prefers it to her 51 previous homes""It isn't what you've done that you regret, it's what you haven't done,"" says Molly Parkin.

Living with addiction,The latest in our mental health phone ins studies the impact of drug and alcohol addiction,[],None,"Image caption This month's Mental Health phone in discusses drug and alcohol dependency

The latest in BBC Radio Cornwall's mental health phone ins has studied the impact of alcohol and drug addiction.

Alcohol can be a normal part of life for many people, but for others it can be destructive.

The government recommends the weekly safe drinking levels to be 14 units per week for women (no more than two units per day) and 21 units for men (no more than three units a day).

One unit equals one shot of spirits or one small glass of wine or half a pint of normal strength beer.

Effects of alcohol misuse

Physical health: Short term and permanent brain damage, nerve and liver damage, bleeding and death are all risks.

Withdrawl symptoms include shaking, sweating, sickness, anxiety, fitting and at worse hallucinations and reduced consciousness.

Mental health:

Alcohol is a depressant even though it may feel like a lift.

It may worsen existing mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and psychosis. It can also trigger them for the first time.

Social:

Changes in behaviour through alcohol use may cause problems with relationships, your job, or result in a criminal record. These will directly affect finances and self esteem.

Pregnancy:

It is advisable not to drink any alcohol in the first three months of pregnancy and to avoid more than one or two units per week after this.

How to know if there is a problem?

There are four questions to ask:

C - Ever felt you should cut down on your drinking?

A - Do you get annoyed when people say you should cut down

G - Do you ever feel guilty about the way you use alcohol

E - Do you ever need a drink in the mornings to function (eyeopener)

More than two 'yes' answers may indicate a problem with alcohol.

Effects of drug use

Physical health:

Each drug and way of administering it has its own potential health problems. These include smoking related diseases, abnormal hearth rhythms, blood borne infections, abscesses and blood clots.

Mental health:

Many drugs can trigger anxiety, depression and psychosis, which may be short lived or more permanent. The 'come down' can make people feel irritable and paranoid.

Social:

Like alcohol misuse, drug use can affect all parts of a person's life.

Pregnancy:

There is no 'safe' amount of illicit drug use in pregnany. Drugs can affect all areas of the baby's development and cause stillbirth.

Physical and psychological addiction to drugs can occur and withdrawal symptoms range from cravings and feeling low to severe cramps and fits.

Causes:

Many people use substances to numb difficult feelings after experiencing traumas in their life, and believe they help them to cope.

The children of alcoholic parents are four times more likely to have an alcohol dependence problem themselves, making early recognition even more important.

Support:

Different sorts of support are useful at different times.

Thinking about change: It can take a long time for people with a drink or drug problem to even start thinking about change. When ready it may be helpful to talk through the pros and cons of changing or thinking of ways to reduce risks involved.

Preparing to change: A decision to change has been made. Help in setting a stop date, and exploring options for stopping are helpful.

Action: Stopping the habit. Medication to reduce unwanted withdrawal symptoms and avoid complications may be needed at this stage.

Maintaining the change: Talking therapies, practical support with finances and accommodation and sometimes medication may all help to ensure ongoing abstinence.

Stafford bishop accuses government over alcohol abuse,"The Bishop of Stafford hits out at the government for ""doing little"" to address the problem of alcohol abuse.",[],None,"Image caption In January, ministers unveiled plans to set a minimum price for alcohol in England and Wales.

The Bishop of Stafford has criticised the government for ""doing little"" to prevent alcohol abuse.

The Rt Rev Geoff Annas has described alcohol misuse as ""one of the major sins of our time"".

Writing in a pastoral letter, published in parish magazines across the Diocese of Lichfield, he called for a ""seismic shift"" in attitudes towards drinking.

The government has said it is tackling alcohol-related crime ""at its source"" through a variety of measures.

He said charities were left to tackle the effects of ""this drug abuse"", with government action not going far enough.

'Major sin'

In January, ministers unveiled plans to set a minimum price for alcohol in England and Wales.

They said banning shops and bars from selling drinks for less than the tax paid on them would cut crime and set a ""base price"" for the first time.

It works out at 38p for a can of weak lager and £10.71 for a litre of vodka.

In the letter, Mr Annas said: ""One definition of 'sin' is anything that comes between us and God and makes us less than the person God created us to be.

""Alcohol abuse is one of the major 'sins' of our time - and it is one that governments do very little to prevent.

""Instead, it is left to amazing organisations like Alcoholics Anonymous or in the inspirational O'Connor Gateway Charitable Trust, of which I am proud to be a trustee, to tackle the effects of this drug abuse.""

'Drink at home'

""Binge-drinking"" was not the fault of pub and nightclub owners, he said, nor was it down to an extension in opening hours.

""The extension of the licensing laws means that they can stay open later but in reality many [people] now do not even arrive until 11 at night,"" said Mr Annas.

""Prior to this they drink in their own homes, consuming alcohol which they have purchased very cheaply in their local supermarket or corner shop.

""The government has introduced minimum pricing but the level it has been set is derisory.""

A Home Office spokesman said the government was tackling alcohol related crime at its source by taking tough action against irresponsible premises, giving communities a chance to have a say over licensing and allowing councils to charge more for late licences.

""And we haven't just stood by while suppliers let drink be sold so cheaply that it leads to drunken violence, we've taken steps to ensure that by the end of the year the sale of alcohol below cost is banned,"" the spokesman said.","['stafford', 'alcohol', 'tackle', 'crime', 'abuse', 'bishop', 'tackling', 'unveiled', 'accuses', 'source', 'spokesman', 'minimum', 'set', 'price']","Image caption In January, ministers unveiled plans to set a minimum price for alcohol in England and Wales.

The latest chapter in Hollywood actress Lindsay Lohan's chequered life was, like many others, played out in front of the camera.

The 24-year-old wept into her lawyer's shoulder in a Los Angeles courtroom as she was handed a 90-day prison sentence for probation violation, relating to a drugs charge dating back to 2007.

Lohan's life in front of the lens began at a very early age.

Born Lindsay Dee Lohan in the Bronx, New York, on 2 July, 1986, she became a child model at the age of three, appearing in Vogue, Elle and a string of television commercials for the likes of Pizza Hut and The Gap.

Image caption Lohan shot to fame as a fresh-faced Disney film star

By the age of 10, she had landed a role in US soap opera Another World, a fertile breeding ground for new talent, which also give early roles to Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt.

Lohan made her feature film debut just a year later in squeaky clean Disney hit The Parent Trap.

Her life in film progressed smoothly and wholesomely, with critically-approved comedy roles in Freaky Friday, teen hit Mean Girls and Herbie Fully Loaded adding to her profile.

Annus horribilis

A fresh-faced Lohan picked up an impressive clutch of Teen Choice and MTV Movie Award gongs.

She branched out in 2004, becoming the youngest host of the MTV award ceremony, and developed an increasingly high profile away from the confines of Hollywood's film sets.

Her apparent weight loss and a string of car accidents created tabloid headlines, and the paparazzi began to trail the young star around Los Angeles.

Lohan, meanwhile, continued to diversify. She had sung the closing song in Disney's remake of Freaky Friday, which resulted in a record contract.

Her debut album, Speak, was released in 2004 and made it to number four in the US album chart.

Her follow-up a year later also proved a hit, and was a more soul-searching, confessional record about her relationship with her family, which she admitted had been a difficult one.

Songwriting, Lohan said, was a way of finding escape from the increasing pressures of her life in the Hollywood goldfish bowl.

Cameo roles followed in more adult-orientated films, including A Prairie Home Companion and Bobby - but Lohan's reputation for enjoying the high life grew in 2006 when she was rebuked for late arrivals on the set of the film Georgia Rules.

The film's producer suggested in a letter, leaked to the press, that the actress's ""heat exhaustion"" was simply the result of ""ongoing all night heavy partying"".

She began to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and admitted herself to a rehabilitation clinic in early 2007 - in what proved to be an annus horribilis for the star.

Lohan was arrested twice for driving and drug offences and had two more stints in rehab. A jail sentence was imposed but she spent only 84 minutes behind bars, and was forced to visit a mortuary to learn the impact of drink-driving.

While her personal life was splashed across the front pages, her film career was hitting a low point.

Grisly psychological thriller I Know Who Killed Me was mauled by the critics - The New York Post branded it ""sleazy, inept and worthless - and Lohan was given the dubious honour of a Razzie award for worst performance.

Subsequent years saw Lohan drift into smaller TV roles, including fronting a BBC documentary about child trafficking, while the tabloid headlines kept rolling in.

She had a much-publicised relationship with DJ Samantha Ronson, but refused to answer questions about her sexuality.

The couple's subsequent break-up saw Lohan take the unusual step of putting out a spoof video dating advert, introducing herself as ""a workaholic, a shopaholic and, according to the state of California, an alcoholic"".

Lohan also joked about her ongoing probation and the ever-growing number of Google searches about her private life.

In recent months, the actress has gained further notoriety for brushes with the legal system and her apparently wayward lifestyle.

She missed a routine court appearance, unable to return from the Cannes Film Festival after losing her passport. An initial warrant for her arrest was later revoked.

Lohan was later ordered to wear an alcohol monitoring bracelet as part of her probation deal, which activated during an MTV Movie Awards party.

The final path to jail was laid when she failed to attend alcohol education classes, although she insisted she had done ""everything I was told to do"".

After a stint in jail and court-ordered rehabilitation, the future looks uncertain for Lohan.

Her recent foray into fashion was not a resounding success, while a question hangs over her movie career.

Lohan had been lined up to play 1970s porn legend Linda Lovelace, a world away from the squeaky clean roles which originally propelled her into the spotlight.

Whether the Hollywood star has the capacity to generate news stories about her work rather than her fraught personal life remains to be seen.","['roles', 'film', 'award', 'caption', 'lohans', 'probation', 'lindsay', 'high', 'lohan', 'spotlight', 'chequered', 'life', 'later']","Image caption Good times, bad times: Lindsay Lohan receives an award in 2004 and learns of her prison term in 2010The latest chapter in Hollywood actress Lindsay Lohan's chequered life was, like many others, played out in front of the camera.

Teacher Steven Watt struck off for drunken behaviour at music camp,A primary teacher is struck off after getting drunk at a music camp and climbing into the bed of a male pupil.,[],None,"A primary teacher has been struck off after getting drunk at a music camp and climbing into the bed of a male pupil.

Steven Watt, 41, was employed by Angus Council at the time of the incident in October 2011.

At a General Teaching Council hearing, he admitted charges including being intoxicated while caring for children.

A panel determined Watt's behaviour fell ""significantly short of the standards expected of a registered teacher"" and deemed him unfit to teach.

The complaint to the General Teaching Council for Scotland related to incidents during a music band camp on the evening of 28 October and the next morning.

Alcohol problem

The panel heard Watt engaged in conversation and made remarks to a number of children in his care which were ""inappropriate and offensive"".

He suggested to a number of male pupils in a dormitory that he was conducting a survey. He then asked one pupil if he was ""camp"" and told him ""it was okay to be gay these days"".

The teacher then stroked the same pupil's arm and got into his bed.

A further charge said he later drove a vehicle while ""intoxicated by alcohol or some other substance"".

Parts of the hearing were held in private in order to protect the identity of the children involved.

Watt told the panel he had suffered from an alcohol problem for much of his life but following the incident at the music camp he was now attending Alcoholics Anonymous.

He said he not had an alcoholic drink for more than a year.

Watt said he missed teaching and that he would like to return to the profession.

The teaching council told Watt a period of two years would have to pass before he could apply to re-register with the council.

The panel also suggested his name be referred to Scottish ministers under the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act 2007.","['music', 'council', 'teaching', 'teacher', 'struck', 'behaviour', 'camp', 'watt', 'panel', 'told', 'suggested', 'steven', 'drunken', 'scotland']","A primary teacher has been struck off after getting drunk at a music camp and climbing into the bed of a male pupil.

"Newsjack Uncut (Actually no, that would be about an hour long and full of mistakes)",,[],2010-01-08 15:07:37+00:00,"So, the first show of the new series has been written, re-written, collated, re-written again, rehearsed, performed, edited and broadcast so this seems as good a time as any to start this series of blogs aimed at giving you an insider's view of the ravening script-hungry beast that is Newsjack. You can tell I'm an insider through my use of hipster, cutting-edge industry jargon like 'show' and 'series'.

For fear of sounding like an anonymous alcoholic, I'm Dan Tetsell and I am the Newsjack script editor. Though I can't give you the secret code to the door marked 'success' - only Jonathan Ross knew it and he's dead to us now - I will try and tell you as much as I can about the process behind the final broadcast show and what we're looking for from our non-commissioned submissions.

For now, let's run through the Newsjack schedule.

As you'll know if you've read our writers' brief (and if you want to send stuff in, you really should) the deadline for sketch submissions is midday on Mondays. We get around 300-400 emails a week and sometimes more, so that's a big pile to get through but, and I can't stress this enough, everything gets read. If you send it, we will read. Newsjack wouldn't exist without its open-door submissions, so it's in our interest to make sure that nothing get missed. As I may have mentioned - everything gets read. Everything. Gets. Read. Oh, would you look at that, I can stress it enough.

What we're left with by around 5pm on the Monday are 80 or so of the best sketches. This is the selection that gets passed on to me and which I then do another pass on - putting them into 'Yes', 'No' and 'Hmmm?' piles - so that by the 10am Tuesday morning meeting we have a pretty strong idea about which news stories we've got covered and which ones we haven't. The Tuesday meeting for commissioned writers is essentially to plug the gaps left by the submissions. Maybe a story has broken that morning or maybe nothing we've had in has really cracked the best comic angle.

Tuesday is taken up with getting as many sketches as possible into as good a shape as possible. Pretty much everything gets rewritten - some sketches more than others. With a show with so many different writers (we got over 70 new writers on air during the first series) my main job is to find, and fit things to, the Newsjack tone. Also, some things could just be funnier. Though I do the bulk of any rewriting that needs doing, sometimes I get the writer of the sketch to do it themselves (particularly if they've had something on before or I feel we're tonally simpatico) or I hand it over to Gareth Gwynn and John Luke Roberts, the Radio Entertainment department's staff writers.

While for most of Tuesday it feels like we've got no show, at about 4pm it all suddenly starts coming together and what looks almost like a show looms up at us out of the fog. The job on Wednesday morning is to finalise that shape. The idea is to go into a rehearsal with the cast at around 1.30pm with about 50 minutes worth of material. This does mean that some sketches that we've done several passes on can fall at this hurdle. Again we may write some last minute sketches to address something that's happened overnight or that morning (though Hoon and Hewitt helpfully decided to shoot themselves in the foot just ten minutes after we'd printed the scripts) or decide that a sketch could be held over for another week - particularly if it's about a news story that's going to bubble away for a while or if it's less urgently topical in it's subject matter.

The producers, our invaluable production co-ordinator, the cast and myself meet in the bowels of Broadcasting House and read the script through once. As I said, at this point the script can be around the 50 minute mark. The aim is to record about 40 minutes, so after the rehearsal there is a quick script meeting between myself and the producers about what needs trimming, punching up or cutting entirely. This can be the most brutal part of the rewriting process. It's only when you hear it read that you can really spot a script's weaknesses. That sketch? Needs to be half as long. That joke? Doesn't work. Replace it or cut it. Any line changes or cuts the actors amend on their scripts by hand, anything more complicated or radical I type up and reissue the pages.

There's then just enough time to rehearse on mic with the sound effects and music, make some final script tweaks, have a small sandwich (maybe they'll get bigger now Ross has gone) and a pre-show wee before the audience come in and it's time to see if any of our calls pay off. Ideally next week the media won't have spent all day warning everyone not to leave their homes and we'll get more than 50 people.

The show is edited on the Thursday morning using scissors and chewing gum before being fed into the giant robot who lives in the Radio 7 basement. To be honest, I have nothing to do with the show once the recording's over so I may have some of those final details wrong.

OK, right, that's how the show works from our end. I aim to look in more detail at each part of the process - and your part in the process - in later blogs but for now I'll give you the most basic of basic advice for getting on Newsjack.

Keep it short. A sketch doesn't want to be more than three pages in radio layout (of which more in the next blog). Keep it simple. At heart, a sketch is a single idea. You can, and must, fit as many jokes into it as you can but the central premise has to be strong and clear. Listen to the show. You really can tell who's heard the show and who hasn't. Go on get that podcast Come and see the show. We record every Wednesday at Broadcasting House in London. Tickets are free and here. Not only is it more fun than sitting at home on your own, you'll also get an idea of what works in front of a live audience and get a feel for our cast. Keep the faith. If you don't get something on, it's not a personal judgement on you. There are other shows and other chances. ""No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better"".

That's right, always leave 'em with a maudlin Beckett quote - it's the third rule of comedy. The first two being a Fight Club joke. Alright Newsjackers and potential Newsjackers, see me back here for our next sermon: Formatting. Ooooh.

On the trail of George Orwell’s outcasts,"Retracing Orwell's footsteps, Emma Jane Kirby finds the hallmarks of poverty he identified - addiction, exhaustion and, often, a quiet dignity - are as apparent now as they were 80 years ago.","['Emma Jane Kirby', 'Bbc News', 'Paris']",None,"Image copyright Other Image caption Orwell's narration begins in the street he called the Rue du Coq d'Or, in the 5th Arrondissement, where he once lived

Some 80 years after George Orwell chronicled the lives of the hard-up and destitute in his book Down and Out in Paris and London, what has changed? Retracing the writer's footsteps, Emma Jane Kirby finds the hallmarks of poverty identified by Orwell - addiction, exhaustion and, often, a quiet dignity - are as apparent now as they were then.

""Quarrels, and the desolate cries of street hawkers, and the shouts of children chasing-orange-peel over the cobbles, and at night loud singing and the sour reek of the refuse carts, made up the atmosphere of the street…. Poverty is what I'm writing about and I had my first contact with poverty in this slum.""

Image copyright bbc 'Tomber dans la misere' (falling into misery), is the phrase she whispers most and I notice her breath is sour like someone who diets or skips meals Emma Jane Kirby

Such was George Orwell's recollection of what he called the Rue du Coq d'Or in Paris, 1929 - the real-life Rue du Pot de Fer. Today it's pleasure rather than poverty that defines the Latin Quarter that Orwell frequented 80-odd years ago. The chic pavement cafes are full of contented-looking people leisurely sipping their vin rose, and the air is perfumed by the sweet smell of crepes and tourists' money.

But poverty hasn't left Paris - she's simply changed address. She may not look quite the same as she did in the 1920s but if Orwell were to meet her again on these streets, he'd know her straight away. And I doubt he'd find her greatly changed...

Poverty came knocking on Claudine's door five years ago when she was made redundant. She leans in close to me as she talks, her right hand often rising to her mouth as if it wants to censor the words that her lips keep forming. ""Tomber dans la misere"" (falling into misery), is the phrase she whispers most and I notice her breath is sour like someone who diets or skips meals.

""We don't eat lunch,"" she tells me. ""It's just my little way of economising."" She nods down to her bulging shopping caddy. ""It's enough for my family's dinner,"" she says, ""but not enough for two meals a day.""

Shame

Claudine and I are sitting in a big warehouse in the north of Paris, which serves as a food distribution centre for the city's chronically poor. It reminds me of the sort of indoor market you find in the less salubrious quarters of former Soviet states - mountains of unbranded pasta and rice piled on tables, misshapen, anaemic-looking vegetables wilting in crates, biscuits and chocolate wrapped in such bland, stark white paper, that not even a child could be excited by its contents.

We watch the steady line of people, Europeans, Maghrebians and West Africans, methodically trudging from table to table, collecting their rations and stuffing them quickly into a pram hood or caddy. Despite the animated cheerfulness of the staff, I notice not one of the customers meets their eye as they take the food parcels.

Shame, Claudine - who is French - tells me, is what links everyone here. She's told no-one that her weekly shop is a hand-out and she doubts anyone else here has admitted it either.

The secrecy that's attached to poverty is one of the first things that struck Orwell.

""From the start,"" he wrote, ""it tangles you in a net of lies and even with the lies you can hardly manage it.""

Orwell the down and out Image copyright Getty Images Orwell was born Eric Arthur Blair on 25 June 1903 in eastern India, the son of a British colonial civil servant. He was educated in England and, after he left Eton, joined the Indian Imperial Police in Burma, then a British colony. He resigned in 1927 and decided to become a writer. In 1928, he moved to Paris where lack of success as a writer forced him into a series of menial jobs. He described his experiences in his first book, Down and Out in Paris and London, published in 1933. In Paris, he washed dishes at the overpriced ""Hotel X"", in a filthy, hot kitchen. He met ""eccentric people - people who have fallen into solitary, half-mad grooves of life and given up trying to be normal or decent"".

Milly is fighting poverty with a fierce, indignant energy. A bilingual secretary from Cameroon, she is immaculately dressed and has the practised deportment of a society debutante.

In the drop-in centre where I meet her, she looks decidedly out of place next to the dusty, weary figures that are slumped beside her. Appearances, she tells me, are everything if one is to cling on to one's dignity. She agrees to talk to me but only in a private room so that the other people here won't realise that her situation is as bad as theirs. When the door closes she tells me that she's homeless and last night she slept on a veranda.

Milly is facing deportation. She came here legally but after she fell ill and had to stop working, her carte de sejour - the papers that allow her to stay and work in France - were revoked. She admits that she is homesick but is terrified to return to Cameroon empty-handed. I ask her if her family know she's homeless and she throws her hands up in the air and rolls her eyes in horror.

""It would kill them,"" she tells me. ""They would drop down dead with shame.""

Aching all over

When I meet Modi from Mali, he looks as if he might drop down dead with fatigue. Like Orwell, Modi is a plongeur, a washer-upper in a big restaurant and he works six days a week, 12 hours a day cleaning pots and pans.

When we talk in the bar of a neighbouring restaurant, his head keeps drooping onto his folded arms and it seems to be such an effort for him to articulate his words that he either slurs them all together in a gluey, glottal jumble, or shoots out small phrases in tiny bursts of energy that fizzle out before the last word has been formed.

Orwell complained that when working as a plongeur he felt as if his back were broken and his head ""filled with hot cinders"". Modi agrees that he aches all over and at the end of the day he cannot feel his feet.

Because rent in Paris is too expensive, he lives an hour's train ride outside the city. Although after midnight the trains are slower so it takes two hours for Modi to get home. He gets up at 0700 and gets to bed at 0200. Most plongeurs in Paris these days are either Pakistani or West African. I stop asking myself why that is, when Modi tells me how much he is paid - just under 4 euros (£3.50) an hour. He's working, of course, ""on the black"".

""The last time I had a night out,"" he says flicking through a virtual diary in his brain, ""was... last year.""

Madame Jolivet can have as many nights out with friends as she wants to - her problem is she's not allowed to have any nights in with them.

Image copyright Other Image caption Madame Jolivet's tiny B&B room costs 1,730 euros a month

The rules of her B&B state clearly that visitors are not permitted, but I have managed to frighten the landlady into admitting me by pretending to be an official from the local authority. Now I'm standing (albeit slightly stooped) in her fusty-smelling attic apartment.

I am Madame Jolivet's first visitor in six years and she is laughing hysterically at having won this tiny victory over her hated landlady. I tell her that in Orwell's day, the residents in his filthy hotel used to yell ""Vache! Salope!"" (""Cow! Bitch!"") at their landlady, and Madame Jolivet doubles up with mirth as she mimes the insults at the sky-light. Then, quite suddenly, she looks sick with fear and switches the TV on at a high volume, motioning to the door and telling me the landlady is probably listening at it. She's right. We hear her tread softly back down the stairs.

Orwell's hotel room was infested with bugs - Madame Jolivet's is infested with mice. She's tormented by their scratching at night. She's caught them on camera during the day, and once she found one in her fridge. She complained to the landlady who warned her that if she mentions it again, she'll kick her out - after all, she's already been warned that her daughter's voice is too loud.

Madame Jolivet is a large lady and she squeezes herself round the tiny space of her apartment. When she's at the sink she's jammed between the bed and the table, her body painfully curved sideways to avoid smacking her head on the sloped ceiling. The landlady charges 1,730 euros (£1,500) a month for this space which she rents out as a 16 sq m apartment. Recently the police did a spot check on Madame Jolivet's apartment and recorded the actual habitable surface area as just 5 sq m - that's the size of about six or seven beach towels.

Madame Jolivet lives here with her grown-up son and daughter. Until last year her other daughter lived with them, too, but she tried to kill herself twice and is now in psychiatric care.

Although it's miles from the hostel where she's staying tonight, Milly, the dignified lady from Cameroon offers to come with me in the taxi to the Gare du Nord where I'm catching my train home to London to make my next step of Orwell's journey.

""In my country,"" she smiles, ""we never let a traveller start a journey alone.""

She's very jolly in the cab, reminiscing about her family, her sister in London, the present she sent her nephew in America last year. By the time we get to the Eurostar terminal I've completely forgotten that Milly's homeless and I realise with a real physical shock that this is exactly what she wanted, that she wanted me to see her as she was before poverty possessed her - a very proper, very animated, valuable woman.

She waves me off, her whole body swaying into the gesture, in that exaggerated way that small children say goodbye. Each time I turn, she's still there, both arms in the air, her head following the rhythm.

Sitting in my seat on the train, my eyes closed, I can see her still. The last line from a Stevie Smith poem comes into my head:

Not Waving but Drowning...

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Orwell closely studied the tramps of London

""There exists in our minds,"" wrote Orwell, ""a sort of ideal or typical tramp - a repulsive, rather dangerous creature, who would die rather than work or wash, and wants nothing but to beg, drink and rob hen-houses... I am not saying, of course, that most tramps are ideal characters; I am only saying that they are ordinary human beings, and that if they are worse than other people it is the result and not the cause of their way of life.""

Five minutes inside the soup-kitchen in Hackney, east London, and I immediately understand what Orwell meant - that the ""typical tramp"" does not exist.

The ""service-users"" - as the volunteers here call them - are a truly disparate group - some look as if they've just stepped off the tube after a busy day at work, others are unkempt and smell feral. Some are evidently fighting a losing battle with drugs and alcohol, while others look more in keeping with an old folks' home.

A well-spoken woman who is far more elegantly dressed than I am, and whom I take to be a doctor, confides in me her concerns about the well-being of a schizophrenic service-user she recently escorted to hospital. She then confounds me by sitting down to eat the free meal. A man with a carefully oiled black quiff is introduced to me by a grinning volunteer as Shakin' Stevens. I smile conspiratorially with him at Shaky's delusions and am later told by the service manager that the volunteer, himself, is delusional and has been coming here to eat each week for years.

Misfits

What was it that Orwell said? ""Change places and handy dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief?""

I am instantly struck by the civility of the meal time. A tattooed and very inebriated punk knocks over an elderly lady's walking frame as he staggers to find a free seat. He apologises, asks if the seat beside her is taken and then appears to engage her in polite conversation. When he is served a plate of Mediterranean vegetable pasta by the charming French chef, he thanks her profusely and leaning towards the Polish man opposite him asks if he would kindly pass the salt?

As I pour tea and coffee, an emaciated black man in a filthy sweatshirt shakes my hand warmly and asks me how I'm doing today? Society's misfits, fitting in.

So that's what you think is it? I'm just yet another homeless drunk? Grant

It's here I meet Stuart, who is currently on a methadone programme and who has serious mental health problems. Physically abused by his father, Stuart was put into care in the North East of England, where he claims he was then systematically sexually abused until he gathered the courage to run away to London at the age of 15.

Aside from a brief respite of a year or two when he had a council flat, the London streets have been the only home he's known. He is now 40. I ask him to tell me what he remembers about those early years sleeping rough.

He doesn't miss a beat before replying, ""Crack, heroin, begging, robbing, stealing and mugging"". An entire life, reduced into just six words.

Grant on the other hand can talk the hind legs off a donkey but he prefers to steer clear of personal details, claiming there are many people worse off than him.

He zooms through his life story with a dismissive wave of his hand - adopted, never held down a relationship, used to work in social care, lost his job, lives in a hostel, spent a long time in hospital after being brutally attacked on the street.

He leaves out the part about his fairly evident problems with alcohol and when, three weeks into our acquaintance, I ask him about that side of his life he snarls defensively, ""So that's what you think is it? I'm just yet another homeless drunk?""

Grant is articulate and funny. He's wary and prickly, yet sensitive and compassionate.

He likes Orwell but prefers Jack London. When my questions become woolly, he pulls me up for being unfocused and he is constantly re-assessing and re-evaluating his own beliefs and opinions. Twice after our meetings he has sent me text messages, apologising for sounding grumpy. When we talk late in the evening, he suddenly checks his watch and becomes concerned about how I'm going to get home to the other side of London. When I ask what keeps him going in life, he gestures towards the volunteers who are clearing up the kitchen.

""Belief in your fellow man's goodness,"" he says. ""Because by and large people are good, aren't they?""

Recession

Orwell always defended tramps' reputation as ""drunks"", pointing out that none of the tramps he knew had any money with which to buy beer. But today alcohol is cheap and features heavily in the lives of many of those on the streets. Not least in the lives of the many Poles who came to seek their fortunes as labourers in the UK when the borders opened in 2004.

When the recession bit and the building sites closed, they had limited access to benefits and quickly found themselves homeless. The volunteers in many of the drop-in centres and soup kitchens I visit in London tell me that around a good third or even half of their service-users are now Polish. As one careworker put it, they're ""Orwell's latter-day Irish tramp"" - Catholic, slightly on the fringe of the London homeless community, and plagued with a ""great thirst"".

London Image copyright Getty Images In London, the narrator lives as a tramp, stopping off in a variety of accommodation - lodging houses, tramps' hostels and Salvation Army shelters. He meets a number of characters, including Bozo, a pavement artist, storyteller and philosopher, who is adept in the technique of begging. One chapter is devoted to the fine points of London guttersnipe slang.

Zibbi, who's in his early 40s came to the UK seven years ago, where he got work in a salad factory in Peterborough. For nine months life was ""good-good"", he tells me in his broken English.

""Good-good, because Zibbi is good and Zibbi no drink.""

Zibbi refers to himself almost entirely in the third person, as if while talking to me, he has stepped outside of himself and has become a detached observer, albeit with an anthropological curiosity in his own behaviour.

""Do Zibbi drink today?"" he asks me.

By the look - and smell of Zibbi - he does little else but drink these days. His face has bloated and taken on the colour of ripe plums, his hands shake and the sharp stench of pure alcohol from his breath overpowers even the acrid, vinegary smell of his clothes and the odour of hot grease from his recent fried breakfast, which still hangs in fat little globules in his beard and moustache.

He shakes his head. ""Oh, lady,"" he says, ""Zibbi drink not a little drink, Zibbi drink and drink. He drink vodka til…"" (he makes a gesture of passing out). ""Until bang and bye bye. Game over.""

Zibbi blames the heavy drinking culture of his country for his weakness and claims his cousin, Miro, is the worst influence on him, egging him on to have just one more. Frequently he seems to set himself on stage, theatrically acting out imagined dialogue he has with Miro and with his disgusted family. It's like watching a medieval morality play, with the forces of Good and Evil battling for power.

I've thought about [my situation] so many times on the streets - especially when I'm alone, but no-one really asked me before... I feel strengthless and hopeless Mikael

The drop-in centre has set Zibbi up with an alcohol adviser who is trying to help him cut down his alcohol consumption. He talks about her in hallowed terms, and when he whispers her name ""Karen"", he lifts his hands and face to heaven. I suspect she's the only woman he has regular contact with. When I meet Karen later she tells me that she's trying to wean Zibbi off calling her ""Mummy"".

I ask Zibbi what he thinks of himself and he looks startled. ""Me? Zibbi?"" he asks uncertainly and his eyes become confused as if he's struggling to connect the alcoholic Zibbi character with the man who speaks his words.

""I… I… I don't know,"" he stutters. He hangs his head and slumps in his chair.

""So tired lady. I… I…""

'Not needed'

Zibbi becomes distressed as he fruitlessly searches for words which might join his isolated personal pronoun and we stop the interview. I realise he has totally lost his sense of self.

A few miles east in Hackney, and Mikael, a young, good-looking Pole in his late 20s, has also lost his identity - or at least his identity papers. Someone stole them one night a few months back when he'd blacked out in a vodka-induced stupor. Mikael is so softly spoken that he's barely audible at times. He tells me that talking to me is like going to Confession.

""I've thought about it [my situation] so many times on the streets,"" he says. ""Especially when I'm alone, but no-one really asked me before... I feel strengthless and hopeless.""

Mikael underestimates himself. A bright man and a fluent English speaker, he's enrolled in an Alcoholics Anonymous programme and, in a bid to stay on track, has made the very difficult decision to eschew the company of his fellow Poles and all other rough sleepers. He is still on the streets but unlike Zibbi, he is wearing freshly laundered clothes and looks fit and fairly healthy. He may not smell of alcohol but he reeks of loneliness.

Seven years ago, life was very different for Mikael. He had a legal, well-paid job as a labourer, he had a fiancee, a studio-flat and a gym membership. There were holidays, cinema trips, football matches - there was, as Mikael puts, it a time when he was ""really connected to society… and there was a future"". Then his boss sold his business and moved overseas. Mikael began drinking heavily, lost his studio and his girlfriend. I ask him what he misses most about his old life, fully expecting him to say the obvious things - a hot shower, a comfortable bed, his own food. But Mikael says something quite different.

""I feel like I'm not needed by this world. Like nobody needs me,"" he says quietly. ""I miss my girlfriend because I felt then someone needed me. And I felt needed in terms of work.""

The evil of poverty, wrote Orwell, is not so much that it makes a man suffer as that it rots him physically and spiritually. Work, he insisted, is the only thing to turn a half-alive vagrant into a self-respecting human being.

Mikael is desperate to find a job believing that work is the yellow brick road which will lead him ""to come back to the normal life,"" as he puts it. Although he admits that it's hard to keep motivated when you wake up cold, wet and shattered from a disturbed night in a shop doorway.

Mikael's progress is sporadic. He has long spells when he's free of alcohol and then sudden lapses which infuriate him and provoke tirades of self hatred, especially when he imagines what his family back home in Poland would say if they knew he was on the streets.

I return to the soup kitchen three weeks later confident of meeting Mikael again but worryingly, he doesn't turn up. I think of the boyish shyness which passed across his face when he had told me that sometimes when he was very lonely he talked to God. The prayer he recited was always the same:

""Hello God - I hope you still remember me and keep some faith in me.""

At the end of Down and Out in Paris and London, George Orwell asks himself what he's learnt from his experiences on the streets and in deference to the great man I shall ask myself the same question. I have learnt how quickly the dry rot of poverty stultifies and festers, crumbling confidence and destroying dignity.

I have seen how poverty marginalises, separates and ridicules. And I have understood that the chief cruelty of homelessness is that it doesn't dull the sensibilities of the man sleeping in the doorway but rather spitefully heightens them, forcing upon him so many cavernous hours in which he can burn with shame, ache with loneliness and cry for his mother.

Perhaps Mikael sums it up for everyone I have met both in Paris and London when he says, ""You know it's so easy to lose everything. But it's so, so tough to get it back.""","['zibbi', 'orwells', 'orwell', 'paris', 'poverty', 'outcasts', 'mikael', 'george', 'tells', 'shes', 'im', 'trail', 'life', 'london']","Poverty is what I'm writing about and I had my first contact with poverty in this slum.""
But poverty hasn't left Paris - she's simply changed address.
He described his experiences in his first book, Down and Out in Paris and London, published in 1933.
When the door closes she tells me that she's homeless and last night she slept on a veranda.

Former footballer jailed after 'bust up' in KFC,"A former Dundee and Arbroath footballer has been jailed for two years after a 'bust up' in a restaurant, while in possession of a knife.",[],None,"Image caption John Carling, a former Dundee and Arbroath football player was jailed at Dundee Sheriff Court.

A former footballer was jailed for two years after being arrested while drunk and in possession of a knife.

John Carling was arrested by police after a ""bust up"" in a KFC restaurant in Dundee.

When taken to police headquarters he was found to be in possession of a lock knife, hidden in his pocket.

The 38-year-old, who holds an MBA degree, was a footballer for both Dundee and Arbroath.

Fiscal depute Nicola Gillespie told Dundee Sheriff Court that Carling was now an unemployed alcoholic reliant on state benefits.

She said: ""At 19:35 on 11 May police received an anonymous call that there was somebody within KFC in High Street that appeared to be under the influence of alcohol, so much so that police were called.

""Officers traced the accused within the premises and he was taken outside.

""He was physically swaying and smelled very strongly of alcohol.

""His demeanour was generally aggressive.""

The court heard how Carling had been taken to the station and asked if he was in possession of any sharp items.

After Carling confirmed that he was, he was searched and officers found the silver lock knife with a seven centimetre blade within his inner left suit jacket pocket.

Ms Gillespie added: ""In relation to possessing the knife he said 'I bought that knife yesterday - I planned to go hunting with it'.""

Breached bail

Carling, of Dundee, pleaded guilty on indictment to possessing a lock knife and breaching bail on 11 May.

He further admitted additional charges of drink driving, twice breaching bail and breaching a community payback order, and was earlier convicted of a charge of being drunk in charge of a car.

Defence solicitor George Donnelly said: ""He was once a professional sportsman - this has been a spectacular fall from grace.

""His football career was cut short by injury but he went on to tertiary education, got an MBA and set up a successful business.

""That business involved a lot of socialising and glad-handing.

""Matters began to fall apart in 2008 when his marriage foundered, and now his liberty has been lost.""

Disregarded opportunities

Sheriff Richard Davidson jailed Carling for a total of 23 months.

He said: ""You don't have any sympathy from the court - following your earlier convictions your response was to breach your bail conditions to stay of a sober disposition on two occasions.

""You disregarded the opportunities that were given to you, and finally, when professionals were trying to address your alcohol problems you are found in the High Street with a knife in your possession.

""That was while you were on two bail orders, further flouting the law.

""You were there with this knife and got into a disturbance, and were so hopelessly under the influence you didn't know what you were doing.

""Those are the circumstances where innocent people suffer serious injury and death as a result of the use of knives.

""You have had all the opportunities you are going to get, and you will be spending a considerable time in prison.""","['taken', 'lock', 'footballer', 'carling', 'breaching', 'dundee', 'bail', 'court', 'kfc', 'possession', 'bust', 'jailed', 'knife']","Image caption John Carling, a former Dundee and Arbroath football player was jailed at Dundee Sheriff Court.

"El secreto del éxito de Alcohólicos Anónimos para recuperar adictos ""en 12 pasos""","Se cumplen 80 años de la fundación de Alcohólicos Anónimos, que propuso un modelo de tratamiento de las adicciones luego copiado muchas veces en todo el mundo. Pero el programa es también objeto de críticas sostenidas.",['Bbc Mundo'],6/15/2015 0:00,"Derechos de autor de la imagen HBO Image caption Una reunión de AA en la serie Los Soprano de HBO.

Se cumplen 80 años desde la fundación Alcohólicos Anónimos y, desde entonces, se han creado miles de grupos que copian su método para tratar distintas formas de adicción. Chris Stokel-Walker explora cuál es el secreto del éxito del ""sólo por hoy"".

""Mi nombre es Pedro y soy un alcohólico"".

Es una frase que suena familiar incluso para aquellos que nunca han asistido a una reunión de Alcohólicos Anónimos (AA).

Pedro se presenta así ante los otros 40 concurrentes a la reunión, que tiene lugar una mañana de domingo en una pequeña sala cerca de la principal calle comercial de Newcastle, en el norte de Inglaterra.

La respuesta es una bienvenida al unísono, cálida y entusiasta: ""Hola, Pedro"".

Quienes están aquí tienen algo en común: su dependencia del alcohol. Aunque vienen de diferentes sectores de la sociedad y tienen distintas ocupaciones e historias de vida.

Derechos de autor de la imagen AP Image caption AA se creó hace 80 años.

El formato de la reunión es simple: una presentación, una lectura, el testimonio de un miembro, luego una discusión abierta en la que cualquiera de los presentes puede compartir sus preocupaciones, sus logros o sus pensamientos.

Pedro empezó a tomar a los 11 años. ""Para cuando tuve la edad en que se puede empezar a beber legalmente, yo ya era un visitante habitual de los centros de tratamiento de alcoholismo, iba una y otra vez al médico, una y otra vez me llevaban arrestado a la estación de policía"".

Ahora, Pedro lleva 34 años sin probar el alcohol y atribuye su sobriedad sostenida a su participación en AA.

Los 12 pasos

Todos los miembros mencionan el ""proceso de transitar por los 12 pasos"" como uno de los pilares del programa de AA.

El primero de esos pasos, publicado cuatro años después de la fundación de la entidad, dice: ""Admitimos que éramos impotentes ante el alcohol, que nuestras vidas se habían vuelto ingobernables"".

Derechos de autor de la imagen Narcotics Anonymous Image caption El programa de recuperación de los 12 pasos de Narcóticos Anónimos es el mismo que el de AA.

Los 12 pasos son, en pocas palabras, un plan de recuperación para lograr superar la adicción.

Ese plan incluye la sumisión ante un poder espiritual superior, el reconocimiento del alcoholismo como un problema que no tiene final, la reparación de los daños causados a las personas afectadas por la adicción y un despertar espiritual a través de la oración o la meditación. (Vea la descripción detallada de cada uno de los pasos al final de este artículo).

Fundado por Bill Wilson y Bob Smith en Akron, en el estado de Ohio, AA se desprendió de una organización cristiana estadounidense, llamada The Grupo Oxford.

El grupo celebra este año el 80º aniversario del momento en que Wilson ayudó a Smith a salir del alcoholismo: el 10 de junio de 1935 fue la fecha de su último trago.

Ese elemento social de AA, la importancia del ""sponsor"" o padrino del adicto, es tan conocido como sus 12 pasos.

A la fecha, hay 115.326 grupos afiliados a AA en 175 países, según las más recientes estimaciones de la entidad. Sólo en Estados Unidos hay 60.143.

De acuerdo a un estudio de 1998, 90% de los centros de tratamiento de adicciones privados se basa en el modelo estadounidense de los 12 pasos.

A cada adicción, su grupo

Y los principios han sentado las bases para otros grupos que no tienen vínculos directos con AA.

Entre ellos, Narcóticos Anónimos, el más específico Marihuana Anónimos, Jugadores Anónimos, incluso grupos para adictos al trabajo o el sexo.

Además de los más conocidos para tratar la adicción a la comida, hay otros para quienes sufren el trastorno de acumulación o para quienes tienen una inhabilidad patológica ""para cubrir sus propias necesidades materiales"". Y para los parientes preocupados por quienes sufren adicciones de toda clase, bajo el rótulo Familias Anónimas.

En algunos pueblos pequeños donde no hay grupos dedicados a un trastorno específico se alienta a los pacientes a que concurran a otra reunión de adictos, así sea de otra clase: que los adictos al juego busquen apoyo en una sesión de alcohólicos, por ejemplo.

""Si uno mira el programa de los 12 pasos, la única diferencia realmente se da en la primera parte del primer paso. El resto del programa es un proyecto para la vida"", dice Pedro.

""Los 12 pasos (de AA) son muy aplicables a cualquier otra adicción"", confirma Amy Krentzman, de la Escuela de Trabajo Social de la Universidad de Minnesota, que ha hecho investigación sobre AA y otros programas basados.

""Modifican el lenguaje, pero la lógica es la misma… y tienen el respaldo de otra gente que ya ha transitado esos 12 pasos y ha alcanzado el éxito, lo cual es alentador"".

La mayoría de los grupos ofrecen sesiones por Skype, donde la disponibilidad es de 24 horas. ""Ahí hay compañeros siempre dispuestos a escuchar y uno dice lo de siempre, 'Mi nombre es tal y soy adicto a tal cosa'"", apunta el coordinador.

La teoría del ayudante

Parte del éxito de estas instituciones se apoya también en la llamada teoría del ayudante, acuñada en los años 60.

Según Krentzman, contar con una persona destinada a asistir al adicto de manera directa suele ser beneficioso para ambos: da al padrino una sensación de bienestar, que ayuda en su propio proceso dado que muchos de ellos son también adictos en recuperación.

Muchas películas y series de TV, de ""The Sopranos"" a ""Mad Men"", ""House of Cards"" o ""The West Wing"", retratan la relación entre el adicto y su sponsor. Muchas veces, los primeros reciben apoyo emocional y espiritual, además de la guía práctica, de parte de sus padrinos.

El otro principio es que AA considera el tratamiento como un proceso continuo, que nunca termina. Y que se aborda de un día a la vez: la meta es ir pasando las tentaciones de a 24 horas, ponerse por meta el día siguiente.

Derechos de autor de la imagen Getty Image caption AA considera el tratamiento como un proceso continuo, que nunca termina.

Esto lo diferencia de otros abordajes a la adicción que ofrecen programas cortos y luego dejan al adicto hacer frente a su vida cotidiana sin mayor acompañamiento.

Marihuana Anónimos tiene ""exactamente el mismo formato"", dice Thomas, un miembro del grupo. ""Tiene los 12 pasos y varias historias que demuestran la aplicación práctica de esos pasos, de gente que ha pasado por la experiencia y se ha mantenido sobrio desde entonces"".

No es para todos

Pero estos grupos que siguen la propuesta de AA no cuentan con el apoyo de la organización central, que se maneja a través de Alcoholics Anonymous World Services (AAWS), dueña de los derechos de autor.

AAWS sí otorga permiso para el uso de los 12 pasos.

Y los principios tienen sus detractores, claro está. Muchos critican el elemento cuasi religioso, otros el énfasis en la abstinencia absoluta más que la opción de un consumo moderado y controlado.

Lea: ¿Qué es peor: un par de copas diarias o una gran borrachera los fines de semana?

Un filme, titulado ""The 13th Step"", denunció supuestos casos de abuso sexual cometidos por integrantes de AA que tuvieron por víctimas a adictos asistentes a las reuniones.

Pero tal vez la mayor crítica proviene de quienes quieren evidencia concreta de que este programa ampliamente aceptado alcanza resultados reales.

""La evidencia muestra que funciona muy bien para algunas personas"", dice Krentzman.

Una revisión de todos los estudios científicos que se han hecho sobre la tasa de éxito de AA, publicada en 2006, encontró que ""ningún estudio experimental demostró de manera unívoca la eficacia de AA"".

Lance Dodes, un especialista en abuso de sustancias, escribió en un libro sobre los 12 pasos: ""Alcohólicos Anónimos fue proclamado el tratamiento correcto contra el alcoholismo hace 75 años, pese a la falta de evidencia científica sobre la eficacia de su método y desde entonces hemos seguido sosteniéndolo como válido"".

¿Toda adicción es enfermedad?

Otro foco contencioso es que el traslado del programa de 12 pasos a otras áreas da legitimidad social a la idea de que una amplia gama de compulsiones representan enfermedades.

Derechos de autor de la imagen Getty Image caption El programa de AA se ha usado desde hace 80 años, pero no hay evidencia científica de su efectividad.

Los científicos continúan divididos sobre si la adicción a la comida realmente existe. Discuten si la adicción al sexo es real o no – de hecho, no aparece mencionada en la lista de desórdenes y trastornos mentales de la Asociación Estadounidense de Psiquiatría.

Pero, para muchos, el programa es efectivo. ""Funciona por un proceso psicológico, uno espiritual y uno social"", detalla Krentzman. ""Por la manera en que da un sentido de comunidad a la gente, por el hecho de saber que otros sufren lo mismo que tú"".

Esto es algo en lo que coincide Jennifer, que asiste a Overeaters Anonymous, para el tratamiento del sobrepeso.

Se unió al grupo en 2008, cuando tenía 37 años y pesaba casi 114 kilos. Hoy, con varios kilos menos, atribuye parte del éxito a su relación sostenida con otros compañeros del grupo.

""Las veces que he ido a terapia siempre tenía la sensación de que me daban consejos para probar pero no tenían experiencia de primera mano. Hay algo auténtico en esto de tener a un adicto ayudando a otro adicto"".

""Es un programa muy simple para gente con complicaciones. Que resiste críticas de adentro y de afuera (de la organización), lo que no se puede decir de muchas otras filosofías de rehabilitación de adicciones"", agrega Thomas.

Derechos de autor de la imagen Thinkstock Image caption No hay consenso sobre si la adicción a la comida es una enfermedad.

En la reunión de domingo en Newcastle, los 40 asistentes se sientan, escuchan y cuentan historias de adicción. Hay apretones de mano y conversaciones amigables, compasión, sonrisas y bromas compartidas.

Uno a uno van saliendo cuando termina la cita: salen a la calle, se mezclan con los muchos transeúntes y sus bolsas de compras y se ven como uno más en la multitud. Pero en sus mentes llevan un peso extra: el del compromiso en 12 pasos, que los acompañará hasta que toque renovarlo la próxima semana. Una semana a la vez.

En esta nota se reserva el apellido de quienes dieron su testimonio a la BBC para resguardar su privacidad.

Los 12 pasos de AA

Admitimos que éramos impotentes ante el alcohol y que nuestras vidas se habían vuelto ingobernables. Llegamos a creer que un Poder superior a nosotros podría devolvernos el sano juicio. Resolvimos confiar nuestra voluntad y nuestra vida al cuidado de Dios, según nuestro propio entendimiento de Él. Sin temor, hicimos un sincero y minucioso examen de conciencia. Admitimos ante Dios, ante nosotros mismos y ante otro ser humano la naturaleza exacta de nuestras faltas. Estuvimos enteramente dispuestos a que Dios eliminase todos estos defectos de carácter. Pedimos a Dios humildemente que nos librase de nuestras culpas. Hicimos una lista de todas las personas a quienes habíamos perjudicado, y estuvimos dispuestos a reparar el mal que les ocasionamos. Reparamos directamente el mal causado a esas personas cuando nos fue posible, excepto en los casos en que el hacerlo les hubiese infligido más daño o perjudicado a un tercero. Proseguimos con nuestro examen de conciencia, admitiendo espontáneamente nuestras faltas al momento de reconocerlas. Mediante la oración y la meditación, tratamos de mejorar nuestro contacto consciente con Dios y le pedimos tan sólo la capacidad para reconocer su voluntad y las fuerzas para cumplirla. Habiendo logrado un despertar espiritual como resultado de estos pasos, tratamos de llevar este mensaje a otras personas y practicar estos principios en todas nuestras acciones.

Thursday 31 January 2008 150,000 people are apparently registered on a website which puts you in touch with people who want to have affairs! And it costs £119 to register initially! That company's making an awful lot of money out of infidelity. There are some very strange by-laws in Buckinghamshire involving orange peel and the latest trend is drinking raw milk, although it does come with a health warning. If you would like to write a short story involving a 'turning point' then do get in touch. We will be looking to make them in to short dramatisations. It should be no longer than three and a half minutes when read aloud. ________________________________________________ Wednesday 30 January 2008 Bull semen is very expensive but rose otto costs even more! We found out that it's very hard to determine which songs fit in to the rock and pop categories, and Coldplay probably don't fall in to either. Dave Bartram from Showaddywaddy didn't want to sing with Ronnie as he thought it would make him sound bad. The nine's new feature may be 'singers who don't want to sing'. And we heard back from Ann Widdecombe after pitching to her the idea that she could co-present the show, her diary's painfully busy apparently. ________________________________________________ Tuesday 29 January 2008 Chillis are graded, as is cheese, although there isn't a standard way of grading cheese, supermarkets just do their own. The most interesting thing that's graded is concrete - thanks to Peter in Dunstable for his thorough explanation. Anthea Turner advised everyone to wet dust everything and not to be too obsessed with cleaning products. Ronnie is coming round to her way of thinking. _________________________________________________ Monday 28 January 2008 Today we discovered that some people have fruit phobias. Liz said she couldn't hold oranges because she'd heave if she did! The Nine team had to apologise profusely for the wrong episode of Feckham Hall being played on Friday and Samantha in Sunny Skegness accepted this apology on behalf of the listeners. Tomorrow we'll be discussing why we think everything has to be perfect in our lives, and learning another fencing move. _________________________________________________ Friday 25 January 2008 Today we learned to play air guitar with the twice world champion. Although it's not exactly difficult. Zac Monroe told us that no practice and a few beers get him through it. We discovered that not all conflict is bad, as long as it's creative discussion and is resolved in the end. Katherine disappeared for most of the show, and only had two slices of toast to show for her efforts. It was Rachel's last day today on The Nine. She's doing a job swap with 'out and about' afternoon reporter Jenna Benson. ________________________________________________ Thursday 24 January 2008 In advance of Burns night Ronnie tried to convince Laura to eat vegetarian haggis. She wasn't convinced. Sue asked whether she had missed the wedding weigh in yesterday as she was disappointed to gain one and a half pounds. But she didn't, Laura's decided to do it once a month as she wasn't losing much each week. We also discovered that being a food critic is an ideal job. ________________________________________________ Wednesday 23 January 2008 We're half way through the week and Ronnie's just showing off his judo expertise. He reckons he used to compete for Scotland juniors or something. Today we discovered that there are 15 different types of pants and some people have 'work pants', 'weekend pants' and 'hospital pants' although if you are going in for an op, don't do as Judy from Luton's husband did and take your other half in a red satin camisole top with black lace and matching knickers. Katherine auditioned as a lookalike/soundalike for Cher, although the man from the Legends show said she had 'potential' but needed more work. If you would like to speak to someone about a drug problem contact TTP counselling in Luton on 0845 241 4588. ________________________________________________ Katherine takes the plunge Friday 18 January 2008 Ronnie's weird. He kisses with his eyes open. Not that we wanted a demonstration or anything. Then we discovered that it wasn't uncommon and the people from the Bedford Bandits roller derby team did exactly the same. We had our last synchronize swimming lesson today, next week it's Judo! A request by someone at a listener feedback meeting last night prompted us to do 'play your town right' starting with High Wycombe, and going higher or lower with villages in Beds, Herts and Bucks. Laura suggested having a cup of tea made live from the kitchen by Katherine in homage to Gordon Ramsey cooking dinner on the tv tonight. It didn't work though. Note to team... team meeting is needed to discuss features that aren't very good. ________________________________________________ Thursday 17 January 2008 Bob said that if you were in a room with 26 other people the chances are one of them would have the same birthday as you, no-one believed him, but we tested it with the listeners, and he was right! We got two matches among 60 people. We also found fresh members of 'the nine' team, there's a Rachel from Bedford, who's an operatic singer, a Laura who's a golfer, and a woman called Catherine who used to dance with 'The Young Generation'. We think we're going to try and re-unite them in a Justin Lee Collins stylee. Can you help with tracking down the members? There's another 29 of them. _________________________________________________ Wednesday 16 January 2008 It was a bit grotty outside today so we decided to cheer ourselves up and visit the seaside and who better to ask what the weather is like than the Mayor of Great Yarmouth, he was very helpful. There is some debate over which are the best and worst cars, but it was agreed that a man in a red Ferrari is not attractive. Laura put on three pounds on the wedding weigh-in, we're now questioning whether she should aim to put weight on rather than lose it as she seems to be good at that. _________________________________________________ Tuesday 15 January 2008 Today we discovered there are more mole holes and hills than there's ever been across the country! We also found out that if you want to stage a concert in a prison then you have to promote because some inmates have better things to do! We also made a big collection of miscellaneous objects found in listeners' food, blue bottles seemed to be the most popular, eugh! Ronnie should be back tomorrow, although his memorial phone in did go quite well... __________________________________________________ Monday 14 January 2008 Ronnie's poorly, so Bob did the show today! We started learning how to synchronize swim with Adele Carlson who teaches the British swimmers. Today's move is the 'back out' and Jim in Hitchin is disqualified already because he was practicing on his sofa, and 'let one go' shall we say! The Nine O'Clock Show court was in session, we discussed whether sex education should be taught in primary schools, most of you thought that no it shouldn't. If you would like to suggest a topic for the court, please get in touch. You can email us any time at the9@bbc.co.uk. __________________________________________________ Katherine Boyle aged 3 Friday 11 January 2008 This morning we discovered that being tannoyed in a public place is quite common. Tony from Boxmoor was told off when he went to a slalom event in Caddington because he wasn't sat in a designated picnic area. Brad Pitt has the most popular bottom in Madame Tussauds, and Prince Charles will always have a waxwork of himself. We finished our learn badminton week with the smash, and Katherine's very grateful for her secret lessons. Earlier this week Katherine said she was a beauty queen. It turns out she was aged 3 and it was at Pontins in Paignton, Devon! __________________________________________________ Ronnie attempts the back hand serve Thursday 10 January 2008 Well we learned some defensive badminton shots today and we can't wait for the smash tomorrow! It seems that many people in later life suffer from bullying at work. If you want some advice or support visit www.andreaadamstrust.org or there's a helpline you can call which is 0845 22 55 787. Alternatively you can speak to the Alexi Sayle lookalike John Ward at the action desk at BBC 3 Counties radio on 01582 441111 and he'll also point you in the right direction. We also spoke to a woman from the BBC pronunciation unit who gave us the definitive answer on how to pronounce Barack Obama. And the nine has had it's Christmas photos developed, here's one of Katherine, Bob, Kiki Dee and Ronnie. __________________________________________________ Wednesday 9 January 2008 Miss England's vital statistics are 34-24-34! I can't believe Ronnie asked that! Let alone whether she's ever been mistaken for a man. We didn't find any other beauty queens, (holiday camp ones or otherwise) in Beds, Herts or Bucks, if you know any different let us know. We also found out that chickens are becoming popular pets and you can name them as long as you're not going to kill them. Tomorrow we'll find out whether you can re-train as a doctor in later life, and how do we develop accents? __________________________________________________ Tuesday 8 January 2008 We asked today what you would do (or have done) if you've discovered whilst pregnant that your baby will have a deformity or be ill when born. And it seems there's no easy or right answer for anyone. Nikki from Luton said even though she has disabilities and works with people, she won't know what to do if she discovers there's something wrong when she has a nuchal fold scan this week. Ronnie's making progress with his badminton, tomorrow Steve the coach says he'll teach us the back hand kill. And according to the 13 year old author of Teen Talk, Lucy Van Amerongen, everything is 'book' which means cool apparently! Also tomorrow, Miss England will be on the nine! __________________________________________________ Steve the badminton coach Monday 7 January 2008 All this week we're learning how to play badminton from the best! Steve Higgins who coaches the under 17 England players taught us the backhand serve. Tomorrow we're going to learn the forehand net shot. If you want some more information about playing badminton go to www.badmintonengland.co.uk.

And how long do you think you could survive for if you were the last person on earth? We'll talk about that tomorrow. __________________________________________________ Friday 4 January 2008 So today we celebrated National Quainton Day! And we discovered that Quainton is rather quaint. Rob the coach driver called us and said in 1958 he was the youngest person ever to have their appendix removed at just 3 days old, and he made national news. We also found out that if you think you're allergic to someone, it's more likely that you're allergic to their perfume or washing detergent.

Although my colleague Bob Walmsley couldn't help demonstrating his extensive knowledge of electric guitars. This is the question he asked our guitar expert, Peter Williams, 'what do you think of the two kinds of pick up between the single coiled Stratocastor or the Humbuckered Les Paul?' by this point I had lost the will to live. I'd really appreciate your help in my new feature called 'Bamboozle Bob', please send me questions that will put him back in his place.

Choice of tipple 'determines different moods',"Spirits may make you angry or tearful, while red wine or beer may make you relax, research says.",[],None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Do you know how alcohol changes your mood?

Different types of alcoholic drink change and shape your mood in different ways, says a study into drinking and emotions.

Spirits may make you feel angry, sexy or tearful, while red wine or beer may make you feel relaxed, say researchers.

They questioned nearly 30,000 people aged 18-34 from 21 different countries for the study in the journal BMJ Open.

All the respondents drank beer, wine and spirits, and many said each type of alcohol had a different effect on them.

While having a few drinks can be enjoyable, researchers hope their findings will help highlight the dangers of dependent drinking.

Angry outbursts

People build up tolerance to alcohol over time and can end up drinking more to feel the same ""positive"" effects that they enjoy.

Image copyright Getty Images

But they also risk getting negative ones too, says researcher Prof Mark Bellis from Public Health Wales NHS Trust.

The anonymous online survey, which recruited respondents via newspaper and magazine adverts and social media, found:

Red wine appeared to make people more lethargic than white wine

Respondents were most likely to report feeling relaxed when drinking red wine or beer

More than 40% said drinking spirits made them feel sexy

Over half said drinking spirits also gave them energy and confidence

But around a third said they felt aggressive when drinking spirits

Drinking spirits was more likely than all other drink types to be associated with feelings of aggression, illness, restlessness and tearfulness

Men were significantly more likely than women to associate feelings of aggression with all types of alcohol, particularly heavier drinkers

However, the findings show only an association and do not explain the reasons for changes.

Prof Bellis said the setting in which the alcohol was consumed was an important factor that the study tried to take into consideration by asking about drinking at home and outside of the home.

""Young people will often drink spirits on a night out, whereas wine might be drunk more at home, with a meal.

""There will be an element of expectation too. Someone who wants to relax might choose to have a beer or a glass of wine.""

He said the way different drinks are marketed and promoted might encourage people to select certain drinks to suit different moods, but that this could backfire if it triggered negative emotions.

""People may rely on alcohol to help them feel a certain way. People might drink to feel more confident or relaxed but they also risk other negative emotional responses too.""

Prof Bellis and his colleagues at King's College London said the findings suggested that dependent drinkers might rely on alcohol to generate the positive emotions they associated with drinking - they were five times more likely to feel energised than low-risk drinkers.

He also said the study revealed a difference between men and women's emotional relationship with different alcoholic drinks.

""We got stronger emotional relationships with women across pretty well every type of emotion, except for aggression."" Aggression, he said, was more likely to be felt among men.

Dr John Larsen, from Drinkaware, said: ""This study highlights the importance of understanding why people choose to drink certain alcoholic drinks and what effect they expect these drinks will have on them.

""The UK chief medical officers' guideline for both men and women states that in order to keep health risks from alcohol to a low level it is safest not to be drinking more than 14 units a week on a regular basis.""

That equates to 12 single measures of spirits, six pints of beer or six 175ml glasses of wine a week.

Experts say setting a minimum unit price of 50 pence per unit would help cut alcohol-related deaths.

A minimum price policy will come into force on 1 May 2018 in Scotland.

Legislation to establish a minimum price is currently under active consideration by the Welsh Government and by the Irish Senate. There are no plans yet to do the same in England, although the Home Office says the policy is under review.","['study', 'alcohol', 'tipple', 'drinks', 'determines', 'different', 'spirits', 'wine', 'drink', 'likely', 'drinking', 'feel', 'choice', 'moods']","Different types of alcoholic drink change and shape your mood in different ways, says a study into drinking and emotions.

Ex-burglar says 'some people need to be in prison',A prolific burglar with more than 100 convictions says a second chance helped him turn his life around but some people need to be in jail.,[],None,"Image caption Ex-offender Jodie Hind has been in and out of prison since the age of 14

Ex-burglar and drug pusher Jodie Hind has a string of convictions longer than his arm - more than 100. So many in fact, he cannot remember the exact number.

He was first jailed for theft on his 14th birthday and for the next 16 years was in and out of prison dozens of times for a ""mind-blowing"" number of offences.

At his lowest ebb he was breaking into houses to steal money to feed a heroin and crack cocaine habit.

And when things were going ""well"", in his eyes, he was making £1,000 a day selling drugs and spending it on sports cars, jewellery and clothes.

But every few months he would find himself back inside. According to the 34-year-old, most people had written him off and did not believe he could break the cycle of crime.

But break it he did, with a lot of professional help, and today he is drug-free and has not committed a crime for more than four years.

'Big baby'

Society was better off when I was inside before I had confronted my problems Jodie Hind

On Wednesday Judge Peter Bowers caused controversy when he said burglars were ""courageous"" and decided to give serial burglar Richard Rochford a supervision order instead of jail.

The Teesside Crown Court judge also said he thought prison did criminals ""little good"".

Mr Hind agrees that jail does not always work, but many offenders still need to be locked up.

He said: ""Some people need to be in prison for the safety of the public. Society was better off when I was inside before I had confronted my problems.

Image caption Jessie Jacobs said ""the whole area of justice"" needs reform

""I was not facing up to the fact I had character defects and these were were manifesting themselves in addictions such as drug-taking and alcohol.

""I had problems such as managing anger, I was like a big baby, and replacing one addiction with another.

""But I have a conscience and I feel most shame about dealing in drugs. I am also haunted about burgling people's homes.

""I thought I could cheat my way through life but with lots of help I have turned my life around and changed my way of thinking.""

'Without hope'

Through the help of Alcoholics Anonymous and other addiction agencies, Mr Hind now works for Five Lamps, a Stockton charity which helps the unemployed get jobs or start their own business.

Mr Hind said his father was an alcoholic but on the whole he and his sister had a good upbringing. But he kept lapsing into crime because he was ""immature and without hope"".

The judge could have chosen his words more carefully - burglars are not brave but they may well be desperate Jessie Jacobs, Chief Executive of charity A Way Out

He said: ""My recovery was very public. I've decided to stay in the area where I committed my crimes and a lot of people don't approve of me.

""But I believe in reform, I am accountable for my actions. I am up for what the judge has said, some people should be in prison but the prison numbers are too big.

""I believe with the right help people can be reformed.""

Mr Hind is not afraid of having a relapse. He said: ""Everyday I take stock. I have changed my way of thinking.

""I am responsible for my actions and learn from other people who have overcome their problems.""

Jessie Jacobs is the chief executive of A Way Out, a charity which helps women and young people to tackle a range of problems including depression, addiction, self harm and exploitation.

It has been running for 10 years and helps about 1,000 people a year.

Ms Jacobs said: ""The judge could have chosen his words more carefully. Burglars are not brave but they may well be desperate. So while I do not condone the judge's choice of words I welcome the fact that he has opened up a debate.

""He said he thought jail rarely worked and I believe we need to reexamine and reform the whole area of justice.

""There are a number of alternative pilot projects ongoing such as bringing perpetrators face to face with victims.""","['need', 'judge', 'words', 'thought', 'jacobs', 'way', 'prison', 'help', 'believe', 'hind', 'problems', 'exburglar']","The Teesside Crown Court judge also said he thought prison did criminals ""little good"".

The Editors: R1 Newsbeat's alcohol week,Can being banned from drinking alcohol hinder not help your chances of recovery from the effects of alcoholism? It's just one of the questions we're tackling on Newsbeat this week....,[],None,"Can being banned from drinking alcohol hinder not help your chances of recovery from the effects of alcoholism? It's just one of the questions we're tackling on Newsbeat this week.



Radio 1 will be looking at the issues surrounding drinking - our week investigating this kicked off on Sunday night on The Surgery. Newsbeat reporter Jim Reed talked about the stories he'll be covering.

All week, our listeners will have the chance to click on our Booze Calculator. You put in the number and type of drinks you had last night and it works out the number of units against your weekly recommended amount, number of calories, time the alcohol stays in your system, amount you spent in a typical bar, how much you spend a year on booze if you have one night like that every week. It's all set in a bar with the results displayed on the blackboard.

You can automatically post your results to Facebook and Twitter. Radio 1 DJs will have a go at this and talk about it on their shows. Why not try it yourself?



The first person to be stopped from buying alcohol in every pub and bar in England and Wales has told Newsbeat the ban has made her drinking problem worse. Laura Hall, 21-year-old, has had to go back into rehab after a period off booze. She was arrested after drinking again last week. You can see a documentary about her struggle with alcohol on BBC Three.



Clearly, it's an important subject which connects with our core 18-24 audience. We will also explore liver disease - something we usually associate with older people - but new statistics show a record number of under 30s were admitted to hospitals in England with liver problems linked to booze last year.

The figure has gone up 53% in the last 10 years from 230 to 351. The numbers are small but rising significantly: some experts we have spoken to believe it is the tip of a very large iceberg waiting to hole NHS budgets.

Separate figures show there are now 71 under 30s on the waiting list for a liver transplant in the UK, up from 28 in 2000. We have spoken to a 19-year-old admitted to hospital with a liver problem and a 25-year-old with serious health problems linked to booze that she kept hidden from the NHS.



In Dundee we're out with police as they pilot a new scheme to prevent underage drinking in the city. Supermarkets and off licenses are selling bottles and cans with a special code. If they get confiscated from someone under 18, then police know where and when it has been bought. They can go back to the shop, study CCTV and find out if shop broke the law or if someone over 18 bought the alcohol on their behalf - which is obviously also illegal.



The coalition government has announced it was bringing in minimum pricing on alcohol in England and Wales. In Oldham that's already happening after the town was labelled the ""binge capital"" of the UK two years ago. Then the council cracked down - more policing, strict conditions on bars and so on. They say it's been a success and crime and anti-social behaviour is down. We'll be back there to test those claims.



Of course, there are the tricks of the bar trade, too: for example: evidence shows the louder the music in the bar, the more people drink, if they take away chairs leaving customers standing, you are likely to buy more booze. We'll be talking to some insiders from the world of bar work about the tricks and the techniques they use to get us to get another round in.



Our audience will be giving us their feedback and I would love your ideas and thoughts too.

The Secret Footballer: I want to 'out' myself - but fear I'll be sued,"The Secret Footballer says ""everyone wants to out"" him. He would even quite like to do it himself but fears legal action.",[],4/10/2018 10:56,"The Secret Footballer thought about taking his life during a thunderstorm

He is the former Premier League footballer behind four anonymous books which give behind the scenes insight into the game.

But the self-styled Secret Footballer says people are desperate to ""out him"".

He admits he would even quite like to do it himself - but the fear of legal action and bankruptcy are the things keeping the Secret Footballer's identity a secret.

Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live's At Home With Colin Murray, he discusses the time he tried to be hit by lightning, and breaking his five-year abstinence to share a drink with famous chef Keith Floyd.

'If I stand under that, that will be it'

The Secret Footballer was still playing as late as 2011. He is English, has played for at least two Premier League clubs and was relegated from the top flight on the final day of the season. He once booked out the top floor of a hotel in Paris because he heard that someone he didn't like was staying there.

After he stopped playing, he started a column, and wrote four books. In 2010 he was diagnosed with depression and at one stage he considered taking his own life after struggling with mental health.

I was really low. We lived next to a farmers' field and there was a power cable that runs across the field with a big power box in one corner.

My wife was out and I remember walking out of the house in just my football shorts and there was all this thunder and lightning around me. I had no top on and I was barefoot. There was one beautiful oak tree in the middle of this field and I remember walking towards that thinking ""if I stand under that, that will be it"".

As I was walking towards it, this bolt of lightning hit the power box and it exploded. It was spectacular. It knocked all the power out in the houses and that snapped me out of it and I went back inside.

I told my wife a year later what happened but by then I was kind of coming out of it. If I had got to that tree and that was that, at that moment I would not have cared.

'The more money around, the more anxious it makes you'

The former Premier League footballer believes his writing saved his life and steered him away from the temptations of alcohol following his career. He talks about the difficulties faced by those who leave the game, be it alcoholism, divorce, or mental health issues.

What you should consider is that when you retire on the Sunday, by the Monday you lose all your mates and all the admiration of the fans. Everything goes off the cliff. Football is completely irreplaceable.

The moment you stopped, all the temptation was there. I didn't drink for five years but one of my heroes, Keith Floyd, was doing a show at a theatre and I couldn't not have a glass of wine with Keith Floyd so that was what broke my ban.

The more money around the more anxious it made you, and you get paranoid about everything because if you don't have anything you have nothing to lose.

You have got to try and keep yourself stimulated. I was lucky that the writing actually gave me something to do.

Keith Floyd shared a glass of wine with The Secret Footballer

'They are going to make a TV drama on the books'

The Secret Footballer grew up on a council estate in rural England and only began playing organised football relatively late. He signed his first professional terms at the age of 21 and had what he describes as a lucrative career. Since retiring, though, he has become more prominent - albeit anonymously - with a column in the Guardian, the publication of his books and, potentially, a television drama.

Some of the most interesting ex-players I have met do not have a profile.

I think that the secret footballer was a good idea and one that was well worth exploring. There was an explosion in help for mental illness after the first book and the Football Association and the Professional Footballers' Association decided to act on it, so I'm kind of proud of it. But I think I ran away with it without thinking where I wanted to take it.

Everyone wants to out me but only I'm going to do that. The issue would be a legal one and I would probably have to bankrupt myself in order to survive. You have to prepare for the worst and, while there are no names in the books, there's a lot of money in football and a lot of people with a lot of money. They don't even have to be proved right they just have to put a case on.

My autobiography will sell on the back of me outing myself but I can't do it at the moment even though I want to.

Cheers! A celebration of literature’s booziest books,Take a literary bar crawl with BBC Culture as Hephzibah Anderson reveals how booze and books make such fine bedfellows.,['Hephzibah Anderson'],7/14/2014 0:00,"Oscar Wilde wrote of his inordinate fondness for absinthe and Dorothy Parker, who was at her waspish best when she disliked something, was partial to a martini or three (at the most –by four she was famously “under the host”). Ernest Hemingway’s poison was a mojito (among others) and William Faulkner’s a mint julep, while Dylan Thomas reached straight for the whiskey. Again and again and again.

Alcohol plays a well-documented role in literary life – or at least it used to, what with liquid lunches and all-night benders that ended at the typewriter. (The clatter of those keys must have been murder with a hangover, which perhaps explains why certain authors chose to remain drunk instead.)

These days, wordsmiths tend to be a more sober bunch but their reputation for enjoying a nip of this, a flagon of that, and a vat of the other, endures. It’s hardly surprising that some of the stronger stuff has sloshed onto their pages and into their stories. Flip through classics old and new and you’ll find scenes of weepy, wanton, comical, carefree and tragic inebriation, in which beds get set alight (as in Kingsley Amis’ Lucky Jim), bears are tied to policemen and thrown into rivers (Tolstoy’s War and Peace), and wives sold (Thomas Hardy’s The Mayor of Casterbridge). Children’s literature isn’t exempt either – remember when Roald Dahl’s Fantastic Mr Fox led a raid on Farmer Bean’s cider cellar?

Proof reading

Some authors run up a longer bar tab than others. As one Thomas Pynchon devotee has discovered, there’s enough liquor in the Pulitzer Prize winner’s books to generate a dedicated blog. In May, the anonymous fan, who also tweets as @Drunk Pynchon, embarked on a project to imbibe every drink mentioned in every Pynchon novel. Let’s hope he has a strong constitution because Gravity’s Rainbow alone features almost 50 different libations, including something that calls for grain alcohol, beef tea, grenadine, herbal infusions (blue skullcap, valerian root, motherwort and lady’s slipper, no less) and a dash of cough syrup.

It’s the kind of drink you could imagine Raoul Duke and Dr Gonzo consuming on their road trip through southern California in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. In fact, it’s pretty much the only thing they don’t drink. Alcohol fumes rise from the page as they wash down a rainbow of pills with everything from beer to tequila. Their baggage includes a pint of raw ether.

And then there’s the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster’, as invented by Zaphod Beeblebrox in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. Imbibing this cocktail, Douglas Adams wrote, is “like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon”, wrapped “round a large gold brick”, which is no wonder with ingredients like Arcturan Mega-gin, Fallian marsh gas and the tooth of an Angolian Suntiger. Its effects, you might imagine, are every bit as disorienting as the potion that Lewis Carroll’s Alice glugs.

A more refined literary cocktail list might feature a sidecar, as sipped by wealthy Arthur Ruskin in Bonfire of the Vanities, a white angel, which was Holly Golightly’s choice, or a refreshing daiquiri, James Wormold’s order in Graham Greene’s Our Man in Havana. Jay Gatsby prefers gin rickeys while Daisy Buchanan is a mint julep kind of a gal. For Anthony Blanche in Brideshead Revisited, it’s brandy alexanders, that sticky mix of cream, cognac and crème de cacao. Personally, I prefer the sound of the jack roses that boozy Jake Barnes knocks back in Ernest Hemingway’s career-maker, The Sun Also Rises. They’re a mix of applejack, lemon or lime juice, and a splash of grenadine.

There are simpler drinks, too. In On the Road, Dean and Sal hang out in a San Francisco ‘sawdust saloon’ where a guy named Walter orders wine spodiodi, ‘a shot of port wine, a shot of whisky, and a shot of port wine’.

Then there’s the Moloko Plus. Also called a Knifey Moloko, this fictitious tipple comes in many forms but is essentially milk with barbiturates. Featured in Anthony Burgess’s A Clockwork Orange, it’s drunk by the narrator Alex in preparation for “a bit of the old ultraviolence”.

Raymond Chandler’s chess-playing sleuth, Philip Marlowe, keeps things altogether mellower with a gimlet, a recipe for which appears in The Long Goodbye. The drink becomes the glue in a fledgling friendship between the loner private eye and a washed-up playboy named Terry Lennox. “A real gimlet is half gin and half Rose's Lime Juice and nothing else,” Lennox tells Marlowe. “It beats martinis hollow.”

And since he brings them up, it would be remiss not to at least nod to the “very strong” vesper martini that Ian Fleming describes so precisely in Casino Royale. It comprises three measures of gin, one of vodka and a half-measure of the French aperitif Lillet. Shake until ice-cold, then pour into a deep champagne goblet and finish with a twist.

‘In vino veritas’

Of course, authors were dousing their pages with liquor long before the invention of the cocktail. Weave your way back towards the canon’s beginning, and you’ll find the hero of Beowulf defending the king’s vast mead hall against the marauding monster Grendel, who’s seemingly incensed by the drinkers’ din. Mead, if you’ve never encountered it, is a honey-based wine with an ale-like taste, beloved by humans if not Old English ogres.

It pops up in Shakespeare’s plays, too, along with still more obscure wines like malmsey and canary (it really did have a yellow tint, apparently). For that joker Falstaff, though, there was only one tipple: sherry. As he eulogises in Henry IV, Part II, it makes him witty and bold, warms his blood and sets his face aglow. Drunk, in other words.

For authors, on the page though infinitely less so their lives, drunkenness is put to good use, becoming another tool for illuminating their characters’ traits and fates: in vino veritas, as the saying goes. And while it wreaks its fair share of Bacchic destruction (just consider the middle portion of Donna Tartt’s The Goldfinch), in moderation, it can also be a force for good, as when Ebenezer Scrooge offers to share a bowl of Smoking Bishop (that’s port, wine, oranges and spices) with Bob at the end of A Christmas Carol.

If just reading about all this boozy over-indulgence has left you a little tipsy, there’s one drink from Gravity’s Rainbow that might be best: a Shirley Temple.

Cheers!

What about 24 hour licensing?,"As pubs are now able to submit requests for 24 hour licences, we asked some of the key players in Beds, Herts and Bucks for their reaction.",[],1/21/2005 0:00,"Features You are in: Beds Herts and Bucks > Read This > Features > What about 24 hour licensing?

What about 24 hour licensing? by Adrian Back.

As pubs are now able to submit requests for 24 hour licences, we asked some of the key players in Beds, Herts and Bucks for their reaction.



The 21 January marks the first step in the possible introduction of 24 hour opening times as pubs are now able to submit requests for the new licenses. The controversial plan has been met with mixed responses from all sides with ACPO (Association of Chief Police Officers) declaring it has ‘considerable concerns’. But what about Beds, Herts and Bucks? The county police forces will not give an individual view. When we contacted the local police forces for their views we were politely asked to talk to Chris Allison of ACPO for an official statement. This was, however, forthcoming, and it appears that they are being very cautious about the legislation. ""Our weekend shifts are the busiest now, so the extended hours will stretch our resources even more."" Gary Sanderson, Beds and Herts Ambulance and Paramedics “The implications for the local Police Service in terms of additional workload are significant and officers will have to be diverted from other policing priorities"" read their statement. “Local Authorities must take into account the effects of a night-time economy when planning future city areas, investing in a public education programme to help change the binge-drinking culture will also be a requirement.” Stretch The Ambulance Services don't have an official line for the whole organisation but Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Ambulance and Paramedic Service Communications Manager, Gary Sanderson, declared his own reservations about the new Licensing Act. “Our weekend shifts are the busiest now, so the extended hours will stretch our resources even more"" he said. “We will no doubt watch an increase in road traffic accidents due to people driving home in the early hours from the pubs. It is not a pleasant job to attend an accident and pronounce a young male or female deceased at the scene.” However, The Home Office has revealed a new proposal to help calm fears over the new Licensing Act whereby pubs may be asked to contribute towards policing and other local costs. Local pub landlords will therefore have to decide whether or not it will profit them by opening throughout the night. We asked local breweries for their reaction and an indication of what their establishments would be doing. A representative from McMullen’s Family Brewers in Hertford declared that they ‘very much doubt’ they will be applying for the new license. This is a line that some of the major chains are also taking, as Mark Jones, Chief Executive of the Yates Group made clear. “We are totally opposed to the change in the law. We won’t apply for any license that extends our opening hours to 24 hours” he said.

Your name: Your comment: The BBC reserves the right to edit comments submitted. lymara

i think it a good idear it will slow people down where is the nearest 24 hour to hitchin kev shanley

it is awesome at last

It should be our right to drink what we want, when we want and the rights of the pub landlords to open for as long as they want. At last we have these rights. unknown

we think that the 24 hour licnesing is a good idea in some ways but bad in others! i feel that it allows more freedom within the drinking society but does mean that there could be a risk to others if people do not control their drinking. Hubert Cumberdale

Just because the pub's open later doesn't mean that people will drink more! Everyone I know has just seen it as though they can leave the house an hour later and still have the same amount of time in the pub as usual. There will be those who spoil it for everyone else but that will die down once the novelty of a few extra hours drinking time has has worn off. Anthony Maxwell

This is a big fuss over nothing. People are not allowed to be paraletic in pubs anyway and if the riff raff are kept under control.. which most places are good at, I don't see a huge issue. People who drink far too much end up huggin the toilet bowl anyway, and no one wants to be doing that in a pub toilet... Ella

I don't understand why it has been called ""24 hour drinking"" because all I have heard about are pubs open later than usual. Where are the 24 hr places? Jess Weaver

Take it easy while being out, space your drinks and enjoy yourself, no need for this 24hr to become a problem, if we all think right this could work in everyones favour.. S

if ur drunk u wont no what time it is! may as well of kept it to 11, to stop violence and the rest of the sh*t tha goes on Dean Hart

i think that 24-hour licensing will just bring out more violence and vandalism and i say that they shouldn't do it but thats my opinion and its not going to change any thing so peace out xx Phil

In my opinion this will increase the amount of drink drivers on the road. After people have stopped having a beer at 3am they are probably going to be getting into their cars at 7am. Consequences = more accidents and hold ups on our roads.. not good!! ROBB

Very negative views, look at the the positives - one major one being that people will not all be leaving venues at the same time, decreasing risks of violence on the streets. People will not have to rush, reducing binge drinking, and in turn reducing £ spent on emergency services I remember when the pubs used to open at 11.00 and close again at 15.00 (London)there used to be drunks on the street's some stagerring some laying on the ground, when all day opening was suggested the reasons against it is more or less the same as it is now for twenty four hour opening. How often do you see drunks on the streets in the afternoons nowdays. Not very often, but there will allways be the idiots that spoil it for the majority jp

i rekon drinking is the best part of the week, now itll be even better Dre

The problem is not 24hr licensing, the problem is the IDIOTS who drink till they pass-out. Thats the problem! 24hr licensing is the way to go and to all you IDIOTS who drink to pass-out DO IT IN YOUR HOME OR BETTER YET GO GET HELP CUZ DRINK LIKE THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR YOU OR ANYONE!!!!! Oli

It is interesting how Blair will take the police's advice on terror legislation but not on 24hr licensing. He clearly hasn't thought of the consequences. Andi

Excellent Idea. Will take a while for people to aclimatise to this new way of thinking and drinking. But after a while, the benefits will be obvious. flaherty

i think everyone shold be allowed to get drunk when they want Dan Barnes

the Local authorities will have direct control, as a publican myself, i would rather keep the old laws. jsut because 24hr licensing is now possible, doesnt mean it will be used. jack

i dont think 24 hour licensing laws should be out because people will drive home because there wont be a cab servie at such early hourers in the mouning timmy

baddle is wrong wresltemania 18 was an absoulute classic, simply awesome Tom

24hr drinking laws are designed to give more flexability, no where is actually planning to open 24/7. They will also give the authorities more power to control problem establishments. Perhaps they could be more strict towards the idiots. Bob Friendship

My view is that it will make a bad situation much worse.As an offshute, this will lead to increases in Council Tax to pay for the consequences. Gareth

In my last trip back to the UK, the pubs in Amersham were still closing at 11pm. As a visitor, sometimes it would be nice to have a couple more pints, so being open until 12 or 1am is not so bad, but 24 hrs, please, that would be way to much. Heck, even New York City, the city that never sleeps, closes down bars at 4am(and I have never made it to 4am!). Jacta Alea Est

After years of hearing both young and old complain about limited on-licence hours, we have to question the implications of 24 hour licensing. Sometimes we don't know what is best for our own welfare. It seems like a classic over-correction to me. Show me a country with a drinking problem where this kind of change has been effective. May 11pm is a little strict and there certainly will have to be transport reform to accomodate any sort of change in drinking schedule...but anyone can see the disasterous implications of this drastic reform. Lauren + Steph

24 hour licensing is a baaaaaaad idea, tut tut! cola cares

i think that pubs and clubs being open from like 12 noon til 4am is quite sufficient we dont need more violence Baddle McGee

I think the best Wrestlemania was Wrestlemania IX, Hogan sure stuck it to Yokozuna! Go Hogan! baz

its not a bad idea but i rekon that it'll cause more violence. mark

theres idiots in pubs all around the country anyway! having longer to finish your pint wont create more of them! At least now at 2am on saturday morning police wont have to deal with 1000's of people glassing each other over taxi's! haz

there is nothing wrong with getting drunk and havving a good time!!!!! James

It's All Great. A very good Idea. Milfred Cubicle

It would, be good to have 24 hour drinking, but police and ambulance services will be streched, and since it is still questionable as to whether this will stop binge drinking I do not think that 24 hour drinking in pubs should be allowed dan

24 hr licensing bad. booze bad.u all bad toria

I agree with Keith, its not the problem of opening 24 hours that needs addressing its the culture of binge drinking that is associated with the uk. tom

booze it out! good idea maybe not such a good idea dont know Bob

RULE DRINKING RULES I AM A ALCOHOLIC AND PROUD DOWN WITH AMERICA DAWN THE AGE OF THE ENGLISH GO 24 HOURS Carolyn Jervis

More hardened boozers going out there...a lot more booze being sold...a lot more tax revenue for the Government. Spot the motive: the real one, not the ""freedom of choice"" crap. JP Smith

Very negative views, look at the the positives - one major one being that people will not all be leaving venues at the same time, decreasing risks of violence on the streets. People will not have to rush, reducing binge drinking, and in turn reducing £ spent on emergency services ahmed khattab

top notch! can drink til i drop at reasonable prices... Grantley Markland

Surley just because pubs open longer does'nt mean your body can cope can suddenly cope with extra booze. But some idiots will do exactly that & someone else will have to pick up the pieces. Tina Dade

Very, Very Wrong, dont do it we will have even more crap on our streets. I'm sorry but the girls are disgusting too. Waste of Emergency Services & tax payers money. Thank you from a 32 year old woman who has morrells + self tought. Keith

Canada politician Patrick Brown resigns amid sexual allegations,,"['Robin Levinson-King', 'Jessica Murphy', 'Bbc News']",2018-01-26 00:48:34+00:00,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Ontario Progressive Conservative leader Patrick Brown has resigned in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations

A Canadian politician has resigned just months before a key election after two women accused him of inappropriate sexual behaviour when they were teens.

How long does it take to fall from grace?

For Canadian politician Patrick Brown, it took mere hours.

Late Wednesday evening, CTV News published the accounts of two women accusing Brown of sexual misconduct when he was a federal MP in his late 20s and early 30s and they were teenagers.

WARNING: This article contains graphic details that some readers may find upsetting.

Although he denies the allegations, by early Thursday morning, he was no longer the leader of the province's centre-right Progressive Conservative party.

Image caption Patrick Brown: ""These allegations are false""

Both women say Mr Brown plied them with alcohol when they were below the legal drinking age. A noted teetotaller, he was stone-cold sober, they say.

Both women say it happened in his private home. The never-married politician was a federal MP at the time.

And both women say he pressured them or tried to pressure them into sexual activity.

One says he picked her up at a bar more than a decade ago, and brought her back to his house with the promise of booze. When they were alone, he exposed himself and asked for oral sex.

The other says he met her on a plane in 2012 when she was 18, and quickly began flirting with her over social media. He offered her a job in his constituency office, which she accepted. Then at an after-party in his home after a charity hockey match, she claims he pushed her on the bed, got on top of her and pressed his erection into her body. She says she froze, and asked to be taken home. He agreed.

Soon after the incident, he offered her a job accompanying him to India.

""He told me that I, you know, he thought that I would look really good on an elephant,"" she told CTV News.

Neither anonymous account has been independently corroborated by the BBC.

During a last-minute, late-evening press conference, where he appeared shaken and near tears, Mr Brown vehemently denied any impropriety and refused to step down as leader of the Ontario PC party

""It's never okay for anybody - for anyone - to feel they have been a victim of sexual harassment, or feel threatened in any way,"" he said.

Moments later, publicly and en masse, three seniors aides, including his campaign manager and chief of staff, announced their resignation.

Sorry, this Twitter post is currently unavailable.

Other staffers soon followed.

Shortly after 1am local time, Mr Brown bowed to pressure.

""These allegations are false and have been difficult to hear,"" he said in his statement.

Mr Brown says he will keep his seat in the provincial legislature as he fights to clear his name.

He now joins company with politicians from around the globe whose careers have been derailed by sexual misconduct allegations as the Me Too movement gains momentum.

The speed of Mr Brown's fall can be linked to the movement that has seen women - and men - share personal stories of inappropriate sexual behaviour.

But politics played a role as well.

Canadian political parties will have watched as, south of the border, former Alabama Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore became the first Republican to lose an election for a Senate seat in Alabama in 25 years.

A number of women accused Mr Moore of sexual misconduct when they were teenagers, including allegations that he sexually abused a 14-year-old girl.

Despite mounting accusations, Mr Moore refused to drop out of the race, and was defeated by Democrat Douglas Jones in December.

Mr Brown wasn't the only resignation on Thursday.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Sport Minister Kent Hehr had resigned his cabinet position pending an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment levied against Mr Hehr on social media.Mr Hehr said he welcomes the investigative process and does not ""want to be a distraction to all the good work being done by our government"".

But Mr Brown's resignation resonated particularly because he was the front-runner for one of the most powerful political jobs in the country - premier of Canada's most populous province that is responsible for almost 40% of the country's GDP.

Now, he is persona non grata as the party scrambles to mount a defence against incumbent Liberal Premier Kathleen Wynne.

Mr Brown ""is entitled to a legal defence and due process, but he cannot lead us into an election as a result of these allegations"", said the Progressive Conservative's deputy leaders in a statement on Thursday.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Republican candidate Roy Moore lost a safe Senate seat after facing accusations of sexual misconduct

Deputy party leader Sylvia Jones referred to the allegations as a ""hiccup"" and said the party was unanimous in its belief that Mr Brown could not continue as leader.

Federal Conservative party leader Andrew Scheer, once Mr Brown's Parliamentary colleague, was quick to condemn the ""extremely serious"" allegations against the former PC leader.

""Sexual misconduct, and sexual harassment have no place in Canadian society, especially within our political system,"" he said, and called for a full investigation into the accusations.

Mr Trudeau, whose federal Liberals have close ties to their provincial counterparts led by Ms Wynne, has a record of taking a hard line on sexual harassment allegations.

In 2015, he quickly ejected two Liberals MPs from his caucus after two rival female politicians accused them of sexual harassment.

His stance three years ago looks prescient in a post-Harvey Weinstein scandal world.

What happens next?

Mr Brown's resignation has thrown June's provincial election for a loop.

The Ontario PC's were ahead in the polls, ahead in fundraising and ahead in voter recruitment.

Their growing popularity was seen by many as an indictment against Ms Wynne's Liberal Party, which had ruled the province for 14 years but whose popular support had been chipped away by divisive policy decisions and rumours of political corruption.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne comments on allegations against Patrick Brown

Now, Mr Brown's resignation means that the Ontario Progressive Conservatives will have to pick a new leader, fast, if they hope to succeed in toppling the Liberals.

Ms Wynne weighed in on the allegations against her former opponent on Thursday from her desk at Queen's Park, the provincial legislature.

The backdrop made a potent statement on her intention to remain in power.

""I was shocked,"" she said of the allegations.

""It was very courageous of them to step forward and I hope they have the support they need because it was a very difficult thing, and they have had to carry it around with them for years.""","['brown', 'allegations', 'patrick', 'misconduct', 'image', 'amid', 'politician', 'sexual', 'party', 'ontario', 'leader', 'resigns', 'women', 'mr', 'canada']","Image caption Patrick Brown: ""These allegations are false""Both women say Mr Brown plied them with alcohol when they were below the legal drinking age.

Obituary: Dora Bryan,"Dora Bryan, who has died 91, was a talented character actress who played everything from Ibsen to Absolutely Fabulous.",[],None,"Image caption Bryan starred in her own BBC show in 1964, in which she sang and performed sketches from London revues and musicals

Dora Bryan was a talented character actress who could turn her hand to everything from musicals to Shakespeare, farce to tragedy.

The variety of the roles she played, including parts in plays by Ibsen and Pinter, belied her caricature as a wide-eyed dizzy blonde.

Born Dora May Broadbent in Southport, Lancashire in 1924, she went to a council school and, encouraged by her ambitious mother, made her first stage appearance at the age of 12, in pantomime in Manchester.

Image caption Bryan recorded the post-war radio show Much Binding in the Marsh with Nicholas Parsons (far right)

During World War 2 she worked in repertory theatre and with the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) - an organisation set up in 1939 to provide entertainment for British armed forces personnel during the war.

She moved to London in 1945 and appeared in a number of West End productions - notably in the Lyric and Globe revues in the 1950s.

Image caption In 2000, Bryan joined the cast of Last of the Summer Wine but left five years later

She changed her name to Bryan, taking it from the match manufacturers Bryant and May. She lost the closing ""t"" when a theatre programme misspelled her name.

In 1966, the actress played the title role in Hello, Dolly at Drury Lane, eating a full chicken dinner on stage six nights a week and at two matinees.

In 1968 she played nine parts as the star of They Don't Grow on Trees at the Prince of Wales.

Later, she was in the National Theatre's She Stoops to Conquer (for which she won an award) and a revival of Charlie Girl. And she took the West End by storm in a lavish 2002 musical production of The Full Monty.

Speaking to Michael Parkinson on Desert Island Discs in 1987, she said musical theatre had always held a special place in her heart.

""I was in rep for seven years and to get a marvellous part in a play is great, it really is super, particularly if it's a funny part and there is nothing like making an audience laugh.

""But with musicals, I like the atmosphere backstage. You go backstage in a real theatre, in a real plush and gilt theatre and you can shout to the dressing room opposite you and you're all clustered in together, you get a real theatrical atmosphere.""

Her theatre career was crowned with a prestigious Olivier award in recognition of her role, as Meg, in a National Theatre production of Harold Pinter's The Birthday Party.

Ab Fab

But she was not just a stage actress - she made her big screen debut in 1948's The Fallen Idol. About 40 further films followed, including The Blue Lamp, The Great St. Trinian's Train Robbery, The Sandwich Man and Two a Penny.

The peak of her career came as she played the domineering, promiscuous, alcoholic mother, Helen in the 1961 film A Taste of Honey. The role won her a Bafta award for best actress.

Image caption In 1994, she was cast in the play Bed, which presented a vast dreamscape of seven very old people - all of whom share the same vast bed

Image caption Bryan and June Whitfield acted together in the fourth series of Absolutely Fabulous

On television, she appeared in According to Dora and Both Ends Meet and, latterly, she joined a star-studded cast in Last of the Summer Wine.

In an interview with the Church Times in 2006, she said: ""I got my part as Roz in Last of the Summer Wine through Thora Hird. We had always been friends, and always nattered on about the old days.

""We knew actors most people have now forgotten. Then, a few years ago, she suddenly said: 'I wish you were in it with me.'""

Image caption Among Bryan's numerous TV appearances was an episode of Casualty

She also brought the house down with a recurring cameo role in Absolutely Fabulous as June Whitfield's on-screen friend Dolly.

This is Your Life

Dora Bryan was also in the post-war radio show Much Binding in the Marsh. And she once made a novelty record, All I Want for Christmas is a Beatle, which became an unexpected hit.

However her life was also touched by tragedy.

Her adopted daughter Georgina died from alcoholism, her son Daniel endured a debilitating illness and she herself experienced alcoholism.

She told the Church Times she was a member of Alcoholics Anonymous.

""I got very lonely on tour,"" she said, ""and used to order room-service with a bottle of wine, which was not the answer. I don't miss it at all, and just enjoy coffee or tea.""

Bryan's husband, Lancashire County Cricketer Bill Lawton, died from Alzheimer's in 2008 and Dora, in her later years, became unable to work, as short-term memory loss affected her ability to learn lines.

She was honoured twice by TV tribute show This Is Your Life, in 1962 and again in 1989.

In her book, According to Dora, she remembered her first appearance.

""I was hoping the BBC would have filmed a message from my brother John in South Africa. It never occurred to me that they would have gone to all the trouble and expense of flying him from Cape Town, and I must admit that when he walked on to the stage with his wife Marguerite, I cried a little from sheer happiness.""

On her second appearance, host Eamonn Andrews ""ambushed"" the actress in her living room, before whisking her to the TV studio to hear tributes from her friends and family.

""Tonight?"" exclaimed the star. ""Oh dear! I've got to do some auditions at four!""

Her final film appearance was in Gone to the Dogs (2006) opposite Anthony Booth.

The indomitable actress said that in her life she was helped through the bad times by her family, her faith and the next challenge around the corner.","['stage', 'theatre', 'played', 'caption', 'actress', 'wine', 'bryan', 'role', 'dora', 'tv', 'obituary']","Image caption Bryan starred in her own BBC show in 1964, in which she sang and performed sketches from London revues and musicalsDora Bryan was a talented character actress who could turn her hand to everything from musicals to Shakespeare, farce to tragedy.

Byrne urges help for families damaged by alcohol abuse,"Ex-minister Liam Byrne calls for more help for children whose parents are ""hazardous drinkers"" after speaking publicly about his father's fight with alcohol addiction.",[],None,"Image copyright PA Image caption Mr Byrne said his father had fought alcohol addiction for 30 years

Ex-minister Liam Byrne has called for more to be done to help children whose parents are ""hazardous drinkers"" after speaking publicly about his father's fight with alcohol addiction.

The Labour MP is urging people to ""break the silence"" about the issue, a taboo subject he says must be tackled.

He told the BBC it ""hurts like hell"" to talk about his father, who died in the run-up to May's general election.

Children at risk must be identified and adults given the right help, he said.

Mr Byrne, who served in the cabinet under Gordon Brown, said he was going public about the subject for the first time to draw attention to the plight of families whose lives had been damaged by alcohol abuse, a problem which he said was ""cascading down the generations"".

The MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill has used a parliamentary debate in Westminster Hall to draw attention to the issue, saying he had lived with the effects of his father's drinking on his family since he was seven years old but many families had had it ""much worse"".

'Sense of shame'

Earlier, he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""My Dad was an amazing guy, a very charismatic guy, a great public servant who inspired me to go into politics.""

""He struggled with alcohol addiction for 30 years. That struggle, that addiction hurt us as a family and before the election it killed him.""

While alcohol addiction affected different families in different ways, he said he was conscious of the ""sense of shame"" that he felt about it and the fact that the illness often transcended generations of the same family.

""Children of alcoholics are three times more likely to become alcoholics themselves and that was the same for my Dad. He was the child of an alcoholic.

""So if we are to break the cycle, I think we have to break the silence about the damage that it is doing to children and to our country.""

Referring to the public reaction to Charles Kennedy's death earlier this year, he said the subject of alcohol addiction - from which the former Lib Dem leader suffered and which contributed to his death - was too often swept under the carpet or talked about in coded language.

'Giving a voice'

Like discussions about mental health, he said the subject must be brought out into the open.

""When Charles died a lot of people started talking about demons and I just thought 'it was not demons, he was addicted to alcohol'. Unless we normalise the conversation about this we are not going to make progress.""

With only one in 20 ""dependent drinkers"" receiving help and alcohol-related admissions to Accident and Emergency departments increasing in two thirds of the country, Mr Byrne said urgent action was now required in three areas.

He wants a major public health information campaign to make parents aware of the damage they are doing to their children while dependents must be put in touch with professionals who can help them, such as GPs, nurses or social workers.

Finally, he said ""we have to make sure that the right treatment is in place so when parents ask for help, it's there"".

Speaking in Parliament, childrens' minister Edward Timpson praised Mr Byrne's ""courage"" for speaking out and his ""determination to give a voice to the many thousands of children who find themselves in the same predicament"".

Mr Timpson said social workers and teachers must be equipped to respond to alcohol-related distress, while the public sector as a whole must be more consistent in its approach to ensure ""families who feel unsupported and children who feel lonely no longer have that as a feature of their lives.""

He added: ""I will undertake to talk with ministerial colleagues around how we raise public awareness of this issue in a similar ilk to the way we have on smoking.""","['alcohol', 'damaged', 'byrne', 'abuse', 'urges', 'parents', 'public', 'addiction', 'help', 'children', 'families', 'subject', 'mr']","Image copyright PA Image caption Mr Byrne said his father had fought alcohol addiction for 30 yearsEx-minister Liam Byrne has called for more to be done to help children whose parents are ""hazardous drinkers"" after speaking publicly about his father's fight with alcohol addiction.

The pay-offs and perils of pay-as-you-wish,An unconventional strategy: Is ‘pay what you wish’ a recipe for financial disaster?,['Sara Eckel'],1/20/2014 0:00,"Natalie and Afzaal Deewan had a dilemma. It was April, 2005, and they needed to find ways to bring customers into their new restaurant, a Pakistani buffet near the University of Vienna.

Lacking the money to spend on advertising or other promotions, and unsure of what they should charge for the food, the two restaurant novices decided to try an experiment.

Natalie took a marker pen and on the shop window wrote “ALL YOU CAN EAT. PAY AS YOU WISH.”

“I liked the idea because it had a funny side and it was easy. The response was good from the start, so we thought okay we can keep going until further notice.”

They never had to stop.

More than eight years later, the restaurant, Der Wiener Deewan, still lets customers set their own price; those who insist on a number are directed to a take-away menu with prices ranging from 4.5 to 9.5 euro ($6.12 to $12.92).

The three-room, 75-seat restaurant serves five curry dishes, rice, salad and dessert. When customers are ready to go, they pay the cashier, stating what they had to drink (alcoholic beverages and packaged soft drinks are a fixed price) and what they want to pay for the food. The philosophy is simple, Natalie explained: “They should choose based on how much they ate, how much they liked the food and how much money they have.”

Der Wiener Deewan is one of a growing number of restaurants that allow customers to choose their own price. Among them: Pay As You Please in Ireland, Lentil as Anything’s four restaurants in Australia, the Seva Cafe in India, Annalakshmi’s two restaurants in Singapore, and five Panera Cares cafes in the United States.

It might seem like a recipe for financial disaster. Why pay if you don’t have to? But the vast majority of customers do pay — a study of the restaurant by economists Gerhard Riener of the University of Dusseldorf and Christian Traxler of the Hertie School of Governance, both in Germany, found that only 0.5% of patrons didn’t pay anything for their meal.

With an average payment of 5 to 6 euro ($6.84 to $8.21) per person for food, the Deewans aren’t getting rich, but they are serving a packed house of about 500 customers a day, enabling the owners to meet their expenses, pay their 15 employees and realise an annual profit of 30,000 to 40,000 euros ($41,043 to $54,724).

“Since we have a lot of customers who are quite regular they somehow choose a fair price that keeps us running,” said Natalie.

Successes…. and failures

That’s a common theme. Pay–as-you-wish restaurants rely on their customers’ sense of goodwill and fair play to remain financially afloat. Some are successful, while others end in disappointment.

In December, the owners of the pay-what-you-wish Five Loaves and Two Fish in Fuzhou, China, announced that the venue has lost the equivalent of $41,000 since it opened last August, with an estimated 20% of customers eating for free. Several US pay-what-you-wish restaurants have shut their doors in recent years, including Terra Bite Lounge in Seattle and Santorini Grill in New York. Panera Bread has had success with its non-profit Panera Cares cafes, but the for-profit Panera Bread restaurants recently suspended a pay-what-you-wish offer on turkey chili, after a disappointing response from customers. The program, though self-sustaining, was mostly ignored by patrons.

Ayelet Gneezy, associate marketing professor at the University of California San Diego in the US, believes that cultural factors may influence a pay-what-you-wish restaurant’s success, noting that the model appears to do well in countries with high taxes and strong social welfare systems. The culture of an individual shop is also important. That may be why Panera’s chili offer failed even as the non-profit cafes have done well, she said.

“If you go into a Panera Cares cafe, you know what it’s about. When you go to a regular [Panera Bread] cafe in a mall, you don’t know what it means,” said Gneezy. “It’s not in keeping with the identity of the store, so maybe you don’t pay attention to it.”

Appealing to a higher cause is one way that many such restaurants encourage generosity. In addition to Panera Cares, the United States has several independent non-profit restaurants that employ the pay-as-you-wish model.

In Melbourne, Australia, Lentil as Anything restaurants also operate as not-for-profit enterprises that are staffed by volunteers and a smaller number modestly paid employees. There, better-off patrons are encouraged to pay a little more so that customers of lesser means can have a meal more cheaply — and the restaurant can still stay afloat. Payments are anonymous, slipped into a black box at the front of the restaurant.

Founder Shanaka Fernando said the 14-year-old establishment is self-sustaining and all of the profits go toward building more restaurants — there are now four, all in the Melbourne, Australia, metro area. The busiest Lentil As Anything, located in a former 1850s convent, serves 1,500 meals day. In addition to the chain’s 120 volunteers, the restaurants are staffed by 40 employees, though their pay (from $65 to $120 a day) is often more a stipend than a salary.

When customers take advantage

But sterling intentions don’t always guarantee success. A Lentil as Anything restaurant in a primary and secondary school canteen closed after 18 months because students didn’t respect the system; a take-away restaurant also failed to inspire generosity.

“We found that they have to feel the experience,” of sitting in the restaurant said Fernando.

The same goes for Killarney, Ireland, Pay as You Please owners Rob O’Reilly and Barry McBride, who see their share of free riders. Teenagers, in particular, can be a headache.

“They don’t know any better about the hard work that goes on in the background, so they pay 20 cents or something for loads of stuff,” said O’Reilly.

The owners responded such antics by displaying a small sign saying that customers 18 and under must be accompanied by an adult, though O’Reilly stresses that most of their teenage customers do not abuse the system and are very welcome in the restaurant.

As with Der Wiener Deewan, Pay As You Please makes up for the occasional freeloader with volume. In Killarney, a tourist town with more than 100 restaurants, media attention, word of mouth and sheer curiosity keep Pay As You Please bustling during the summer, when outdoor seating enables them to serve as many as 120 meals a day (the restaurant itself seats 25). The restaurant makes enough to provide salaries for themselves and six employees, as well as pay all the restaurant’s bills.

The restaurant gives customers a list of suggested prices and a tin can at their table in which to deposit the payment of their choice.

The loose system, O’Reilly hopes, creates a more relaxing experience for the customer, who won’t have to stress about adding extras.

“Normally, you want more cake or more coffee you’re thinking ‘All of this is going to add up to a lot.’ We wanted it to feel more like you were in someone’s house. The whole vibe is a giving vibe and hopefully they will give back.”

This week was a story about police trying to trace a lorry-load of whisky which was stolen while the driver took a shower at a motorway service station. The truck was driven off from Reading Services in Berkshire and later found abandoned but empty.

So, how did you do? Well, there were some extremely popular themes.

Alcohol limits advice 'confusing',"Using units to set out safe drinking levels is confusing, and guidance needs to be much simpler according to the head of a support charity.","['Debbie', 'Ceo Of Swanswell', 'Alcohol', 'Drug', 'Support Services']",None,"Image caption People have little 'specific' idea of how much they can drink

The advice on alcohol limits is too confusing according to Debbie Bannigan, head of the charity Swanswell. She says that 'units' mean nothing to many people - and the guidance should be clearer and easier to remember.

In this week's Scrubbing Up, she says that to have a daily ""safe"" amount is misleading and that some people - including pregnant women and drivers - should be told ""no alcohol is best"".

Most people think they have a rough idea of ""how much is too much?"", but ask them for specifics and they're not sure. Who can blame them, when the measure that is used to define safe limits - 'units' - is so hard to understand?

While 82% of adults claim to know what a unit of alcohol is, 77% don't know how many units are in a typical large glass of wine.

Ironically, 'units' become even harder to compute when we've had a drink, because the part of our brain that works that sort of thing out switches off.

And the concept of a daily safe amount may even encourage the idea that we should drink alcohol every day.

To add to the confusion, we're bombarded with new ""scientific"" findings about alcohol.

In the last couple of months alone, we've been told that alcohol damages the DNA of unborn children beyond repair, but that it's OK for pregnant women to have a couple of glasses of wine a week, which is pretty conflicting advice.

Reported health benefits from alcohol are rarely balanced with information about the risks, or the observation that the benefits can be achieved in other ways that don't carry any significant risks at all.

It's little surprise that people are confused about the impact alcohol can have on their lives.

But walk into any supermarket and you'll be encouraged to buy alcohol.

My local supermarket's ""seasonal aisle"" - one of the first things you see when you enter the store - has become a wine festival.

And the end of each aisle - the ""impulse buy"" space - is also stacked with cans of lager and cider, so selecting and purchasing alcohol is just part of the weekly shop rather than something that we have to think about doing.

Drink, anyone?

The people who come to us for help are just like you and me, but they've found that their choice to drink alcohol has been riskier than they expected.

What can be done about it? Official guidelines could be clearer. Other public health messages are short and snappy, like 'clunk-click every trip' or 'catch it bin it kill it'.

We shouldn't be afraid of setting clear guidelines and sticking to them

They are designed to be simple and memorable, so we learn and apply them without trying.

Units don't work this way, but a simple phrase like 'one or two, once or twice' gives us a simple yardstick that drinking one or two alcoholic drinks, once or twice a week, is a good limit.

Sometimes a clear, easy to understand and safe message is that no alcohol is best - for example, for children, in pregnancy or when driving.

Scientific evidence shows that even one drink can impair judgement when driving and that alcohol affects children disproportionately, especially before they are born.

A zero limit for drivers, pregnant women and children avoids confusion and helps us all to take responsibility.

We shouldn't be afraid of setting clear guidelines and sticking to them.

With co-operation between drinks manufacturers, supermarkets and the government we can judge the risk of alcohol use for ourselves.

Not only can we reach the point where hospital admissions are going down instead of up, we can create a society that is free from problem alcohol use altogether.","['alcohol', 'units', 'limits', 'simple', 'drink', 'idea', 'confusing', 'guidelines', 'safe', 'children', 'advice', 'women', 'pregnant']","Image caption People have little 'specific' idea of how much they can drinkThe advice on alcohol limits is too confusing according to Debbie Bannigan, head of the charity Swanswell.

""Catherine Zeta-Jones on drugs!"" That could be the startling headline in tomorrow's tabloids if Mrs Michael Douglas decides to star in Rachel's Holiday. It's an adaptation of Marian Keyes' novel about a woman's slide into drug addiction. Described by Variety as ""a dramatic story with comic moments"", the movie follows its heroine as she overdoses on sleeping pills, loses her job, boyfriend, and best friend then flies from New York to Dublin to go into rehab.

British helmer Edgar Wright - one half of the team behind last year's smash hit Shaun Of The Dead - is in negotiations to direct comic book adaptation Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Life. Based on Bryan Lee O'Malley's funnily titled graphic novel, Life is the story of a man who meets the woman of his dreams but can only woo her after fighting and defeating her seven evil ex-boyfriends. Wright, who helmed TV's sitcom Spaced, has recently been branching out with a cameo in George Romero's upcoming zombie flick Land Of The Dead and directing duties on a music video for ex-Ash rocker Charlotte Hatherley.

Shock helmer Abel Ferrara (Bad Lieutenant, Ms 45) has snagged a high profile cast for his latest assault on the moral majority.

Binoche plays an actress who becomes obsessed with Mary Magdalene after playing her in a movie and so sets off on a journey of discovery from New York to Rome and Jerusalem.

Turkey arrests after adulterated alcohol kills Russians,Turkish police investigating a mass alcohol poisoning last month have made 22 arrests and seized thousands of bottles of bootleg liquor.,[],None,"Image caption The incident occurred on a yacht in a popular holiday region

Turkish police investigating a mass alcohol poisoning last month have made 22 arrests and seized thousands of bottles of bootleg liquor.

A clandestine factory was reportedly found where methanol was being used to make counterfeit alcoholic drinks.

Four Russian tour guides died and some 20 fell ill after being served tainted alcohol on a yacht near the resort of Bodrum.

The deaths of the guides, mostly young women, made headlines in Russia.

According to Turkish news agency Anatolia, arrests were made in four different regions of the country.

In the southern province of Mersin, 7,000 bottles of bootleg liquor were found along with empty bottles, stickers and other materials used in production.

Police reportedly found methanol, commonly used to mix bootleg alcohol, in whiskey on the yacht.

Turkey's agriculture ministry said earlier that the alcoholic drinks served on the yacht had been imported by an Ankara company from North Cyprus and distributed to Ankara, Mersin, Antalya and Mugla.

'Strange taste'

The latest victim, a Russian man, died on Monday in hospital in western Turkey.

Two of the other victims also died in Turkey and the third after flying back to Moscow.

Twenty Russians and one Turk were affected, and one woman has been in a coma.

The party of some 60 Russians was largely made up of travel agency managers, in Turkey for a fact-finding visit, the Russian newspaper Argumenty i Fakty reported last week.

Anatasia Lavrenko, whose friend Marina Shevelyova died in Moscow, told Russian online newspaper Life News they had paid $50 for the night-time cruise and each had been served between 10 and 12 of their favourite cocktails, whiskey and cola.

""Sometimes it seemed like the taste of the alcohol was too strong but then I thought the barmen had simply poured out too much whiskey and I did not attach any importance to it,"" she said.

Life News published on its Russian-language website a photo said to show the two young women drinking aboard the yacht.

The day after the cruise, when they were due to fly home together, both women woke up feeling ill but blamed a hangover.

However, Ms Shevelyova became more and more sick on the flight back and, after being rushed to hospital in Moscow, died last Tuesday.","['kills', 'alcohol', 'adulterated', 'died', 'whiskey', 'bootleg', 'russian', 'yacht', 'served', 'turkey', 'russians', 'arrests', 'bottles', 'women', 'used']","Image caption The incident occurred on a yacht in a popular holiday regionTurkish police investigating a mass alcohol poisoning last month have made 22 arrests and seized thousands of bottles of bootleg liquor.

Programme 4.

TX: 11.02.14 2100-2130

PRESENTER: MARK PORTER

PRODUCER: ERIKA WRIGHT

Porter

Coming up in today’s programme: Gut instinct – why doctors should acknowledge and embrace gut feelings. That little voice in your head questioning the diagnosis might just be right.

Glucosamine – a popular alternative remedy for painful joints but the latest guidance from NICE implies it’s a waste of time and money. So why has a supplement, once prescribed on the NHS, fallen so far out of favour?

Alcohol – we look at the latest thinking on the role of medication in helping problem drinkers and discover why it is never a good idea to try and drown your sorrows.

Clip

Probably people who start out being depressed may well be taking alcohol as a form of medication to try and improve their mood, which obviously it’s not going to do – it’s going to make it worse. Equally people who are alcohol dependent may well become depressed because of the chemical changes that the alcohol has in the brain.

Porter

More about the relationship between alcohol and depression later. But first arthritis and new guidance this week from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence on how to diagnose and treat osteoarthritis, a condition thought to affect joints like the hands, knees, hips and spines of at least eight million people in the UK. The guidance was expected somewhat controversially to advise against the routine use of regular paracetamol to ease pain and stiffness but there are reports of a last minute change of heart. Margaret McCartney is in our Glasgow studio. Margaret, why were NICE concerned about paracetamol in the first place?

McCartney

Well there were two main problems. The first one was that NICE had felt that for many people using paracetamol for osteoarthritis pain was no more effective than placebo, so they had identified a group of patients who were using paracetamol with no additional benefit beyond that placebo. The second problem was they felt that some research had identified that paracetamol used high dose and in the long term had an increased risk of complications such as heart attacks, strokes and gastrointestinal bleeds. Now the problem with this research evidence was that it wasn’t very strong but NICE had initially felt that it was strong enough to urge caution for doctors who were recommending long term high dose paracetamol for patients.

Porter

And I suppose this is a risk versus benefit, isn’t it, if the drug’s not working that well for a lot of people then you worry more about the side effects.

McCartney

Absolutely, it’s all about the risk/benefit ratio. So if you’re taking something and you’re not getting any positive effect but you’re at risk of side effects, that’s one thing, but if you’re taking a drug and that’s actually having quite a good effect on you you might be quite willing to accept a small risk of complications because of that. But I think the problem for me has been that the research evidence that NICE had relied on to make this association between a risk of side effects and this long term high usage of paracetamol actually is not terribly strong. Additionally the problem is when you don’t recommend paracetamol well what are you going to recommend instead? How do we know that not using paracetamol regularly is better for us than the alternative which might be using anti-inflammatory drugs, which we know have a higher risk of gastrointestinal side effects or even using opiate based drugs, which obviously have many more side effects compared with paracetamol? So I think really what is the risk/benefit from not using paracetamol? That’s the question we’ve still to answer.

Porter

Margaret McCartney thank you very much.

What didn’t get a reprieve though in the new guidance was the supplement glucosamine – NICE does not believe there’s enough evidence to support the use of glucosamine in osteoarthritis, with or without the other popular ingredient chondroitin.

So why do so many people take it? And why do some studies suggest it helps arthritis, while others don't? Questions I put to Professor John Kirwan , Consultant Rheumatologist at the Bristol Royal Infirmary.

Kirwan

The situation with glucosamine is a bit of a confusing area and this is because glucosamine isn’t officially a medicine. Theoretically it’s a food, it’s called a nutraceutical, which is a food that’s thought to have some medicinal properties and it’s possible to extract it from cocks combs – the bits on the head of chickens – and you can extract it from shell fish and there’s various other places you can get it from. And so the way it’s licensed for use and the way it’s prescribed and the way people take it and the information that’s available isn’t the same as it would be if you had a routine medicine. For example you don’t have to prove things in the same way for glucosamine as you would have to do for a painkiller tablet and as long as you don’t actually tell lies about it you can say whatever you like.

Porter

So you can make claims like it may help your joints and that’s not a medicinal claim per se – you’re not saying it’s treating arthritis?

Kirwan

Well the word “may” is the key here because that means it might not as well. In fact if you look on the web, for example, or look on adverts on buses to see what is said about glucosamine the adverts focus on the reports of individual people who’ve tried it who say how good it was for them. And that’s a true statement, that’s what these people have said but there’s all sorts of reasons why people might get less pain from their arthritis if they take glucosamine, which has got nothing to do with the actual glucosamine.

Porter

One of the things that I find confusing as a healthcare professional is you do see reports of trials into glucosamine and with osteoarthritis of the knee, for instance, I can remember a couple of those where they say that this seems to have an effect and then somewhere along the line you’d read a review that says it has no effect.

Kirwan

Well there are a variety of reports but you know life is not black and white, so that when we do our clinical trials just because you’ve done a clinical trial, even if you do it properly, it doesn’t automatically mean that you’ve got the right answer from the trial, especially if you do small clinical trials with only a few people in – a dozen or two dozen people. It’s easy by chance to get some people who get a lot better during your trial and happening to be taking the medication or happen to have been taking the substance glucosamine. And then you get the results of the trial and it looks like it works. The trouble is you would do another trial with another dozen people in it and it would look like it didn’t work. And the problem with glucosamine is that the trials that look like it works get published in the medical literature and get quoted and the trials that look like it doesn’t work just get forgotten and never get published.

And there’s a way of recognising this, there’s a scientific way of recognising this, that we actually teach our medical students and I actually use the example of glucosamine to teach this way of recognising things and it’s called publication bias. And if you were a company making a new product that you thought might help people you could do lots and lots of small trials and some of them would say it’s helpful and some of them say it’s not helpful and you just publish the ones that say it’s helpful and then you could point to the literature, the reports in the scientific literature, and you could say look at this there are seven reports in the scientific literature that say it’s helpful. And if you take the average of them, which is what a review normally does, it takes the average of all the reports, the average says it works but that’s because you’ve left out half of the information that says it doesn’t work and so there’s nothing to balance out the viewpoint. The way to get round that – there’s two ways to get round that, one is to make sure that all the results for all trials are always published and there is a campaign at the moment called “The All Trials Campaign”, which you might well have heard about, which is trying to make sure that happens and if that happens then when we do these amalgamated reviews of putting all the results together they’ll be more accurate. The other way to do it is to do big trials because on big trials you don’t get this random variation, you get a much more correct picture. And there have been two very big trials done of glucosamine in osteoarthritis of the knee, one in the UK and one in America, and they both came to the same answer which was there’s no real benefit.

Porter

And has that answered this conundrum for you, you’re quite happy now that we know that glucosamine doesn’t help arthritis?

Kirwan

So there’s two things there, I’m quite happy that it doesn’t have a medical effect on the arthritis on the joints but there may be other reasons why glucosamine might be helpful for patients and we also talk to our medical students about these other reasons too. There’s an attitude that people take to their illnesses called self-efficacy, which means people who have high self-efficacy feel that there’s something they personally can do that will help their disease and make their pain less and make them more able to walk around etc. And there’s quite a lot of evidence in the psychology literature that if you have high self-efficacy you suffer less symptoms from whatever disease that you’ve got and you’re able to do more things, whatever the disease is. Now to me when some patients who’ve got say osteoarthritis of the knee or any other problem decide that it’s time for themselves to do something about it and they’re going to go out and try these tablets out, to me that is increasing their self-efficacy, they’re feeling that they’re taking charge of the situation and doing something about it. And I think that that sometimes makes some people feel better and have less pain and able to do more, it doesn’t have anything to do with the chemical effects of the glucosamine, it has to do with their state of mind and their approach to managing their own arthritis and their own pain.

Porter

Is there a downside to taking glucosamine that you’re aware of?

Kirwan

Well there are some downsides. I mean if you look in the British National Formulary it actually lists glucosamine in there and it says there are side effects and some people get nausea and vomiting and so on. But the real downside to me is it might make people miss out on some otherwise good treatments because they think they should be using this instead of ordinary treatments. The most important one is physiotherapy and exercise and so on, you can use painkillers and there are some additional treatments that you can use for osteoarthritis. What worries me is that I do occasionally see people who somehow feel the proven treatments are something they should be avoiding and they’ll take glucosamine instead, I think that’s a bad thing. I mean you have to spend money on it as well, although you can get it quite cheaply on the internet but if people want to spend a little bit of their own money and try it out and if they feel personally that it’s helping them it’s probably not doing any harm.

Porter

It’s quite interesting that when people look for something to help themselves they turn to a tablet like glucosamine or a capsule and they don’t look at, for instance, exercise – physiotherapy – strengthening the thigh muscles which can help in osteoarthritis of the knee.

Kirwan

It certainly can help and those would be things that we’d advise people – and weight loss if you’re overweight and regular exercise and so on. Well you know different people expect different things from life and some people just are more tuned in to taking tablets and things and so they like to do that. I don’t advise people to take glucosamine and if my patients ask me about it I tell them what I’ve been telling you and I’ll let them decide what to do.

One listener - who wishes to remain anonymous – e-mailed to ask why you hear so little about new drug based treatments for problem drinkers. Drugs like nalmefene and naltrexone have made the headlines recently, but what sort of impact do they actually have clinically?

I know just the people to ask.

NICE has recently looked at the role of medicines in treating alcohol abuse and Colin Drummond, Professor of Addiction Psychiatry at Kings College London, chaired the group behind the latest guidelines. And Anne Lingford Hughes is a consultant psychiatrist and Professor of Addiction Biology at Imperial College.

Hughes

We know that from the clinical trials they are effective but we’re now starting to understand how they may affect brain mechanisms, how alcohol is affecting the brain and therefore how these drugs may interact with those mechanisms to help people stop drinking or stop the risk of relapse – so stop craving or other mechanisms like that.

Porter

Is there a common pathway that these drugs are working on or do they have unique actions?

Hughes

Each has their own particular target but we think a common theme is that they alter processes in the brain such as reward. There are others that possibly have an effect on impulsivity and it’s this type of mechanism that we’re just now starting to unravel.

Porter

Colin, looking at the evidence for these drugs what sort of impact do they have, I mean is it pronounced?

Drummond

Yes it’s certainly a significant effect on reducing people’s alcohol consumption, providing they’re taken as directed and on a regular basis. And also providing they’re prescribed in the context of a wider treatment plan with psychological interventions and social support. But it seems remarkably difficult to persuade doctors to prescribe in this condition, in other words it’s not very hard to get them to prescribe for depression. The data on prescribing that we have on drugs like acamprosate is that it is prescribed very rarely compared to what we know is the prevalence of the problem. And this isn’t just the UK, this is true in the United States and the National Institutes of Health in the US have been scratching their heads and trying to think how do we persuade doctors to embrace these drugs more. There’s a kind of general feeling, a sort of nihilistic feeling amongst some doctors that you just cannot do anything for this population.

Porter

Why do you think that is?

Drummond

I think it’s partly there’s a lack of training, I think also alcohol is competing with all the other things that doctors have to do in the course of what it is now seven minute interview, they’re being asked to look at smoking, diet, other lifestyle issues and…

Porter

Not asked to look at alcohol though specifically in most people, I mean we do in the over 40s but it’s interesting that it’s been left out of that sort of list of tick boxes.

Drummond

Exactly and yet we have very effective interventions.

Porter

It’s an oft abused cliché but it does have the ring of the Cinderella of the addiction world and I’m just intrigued as to how it’s got there, it’s just been left behind has it?

Drummond

Well in a policy sense I think the excitement in government has been around drugs and drug misuse and what to do about that.

Porter

And the war on smoking has been all consuming hasn’t it.

Drummond

Absolutely and not just about helping people to quit but actually making tobacco less available.

Porter

You must look at the protocols with envy from the alcohol.

Drummond

I think we could learn a lot from the tobacco field to be honest.

Hughes

So I’m aware of people who do contact us wanting medication but either their GP doesn’t know about it enough, which I think is perfectly understandable, as Colin’s already discussed about training etc., is a major issue, but I have had the situation where it’s been hard for me to start in specialist care, the GP may be willing but the approvals aren’t in place.

Porter

Is there concern from some quarters of the medicalisation of this?

Drummond

It sort of comes down to partly what you think the problem is, if you think the problem is a sort of lifestyle choice or a psychological issue then you’re probably not going to see much of a role for drugs. But I think Anne and I would probably see it as a much more complex picture. Alcohol is a drug itself, it’s having effects on the brain, that’s what’s producing the dependence and the drugs, although we don’t completely understand how they work, are probably reversing some of those effects.

Porter

And these sorts of effects that the drugs are reversing are they the result of long term drinking or are they something that might have pre-existed that made the person more likely to be a problem drinker in the first place?

Hughes

Probably both, we don’t understand that yet but certainly we’ve got a large scanning programme on at the moment looking at reward mechanisms and impulsivity and sort of emotional stress and looking at how a drug like naltrexone might modulate those responses and we’re just starting to get the data out now. But certainly we know that naltrexone can change reward responding in the brain, it can change impulsivity activity in the brain, so we think it’s getting some of the core mechanisms.

Porter

And it would dampen down the reward and make you less impulsive – that would be the aim which you would say – would suggest would be helping someone control their drinking?

Hughes

Yes. I mean interestingly alcoholics have a blunted reward system to alcohol salient cues and that’s because we’re probably in a sense got tolerant to the cues, their natural – so-called natural pleasure/reward system isn’t working properly. Now that taps into depression, which has been mentioned a few times, that many people with alcohol problems are depressed. Well if alcohol has done that to your reward system then you won’t get the non-drug pleasures out of life. So one of the things naltrexone might do in this case is tend to normalise this function to help you respond to the non-drug pleasures but dampen the drug related pleasures down. And I think it’s understanding that because it is odd, in a sense, the most common drug probably prescribed to a person with alcohol problems is an anti-depressant, whereas the clinical trials are very clear that they don’t improve either depression unless you’re severely depressed nor alcohol consumption.

Drummond

Another problem is that if you’re prescribing anti-depressants and treating depression in somebody with alcohol dependence you’re delaying treating the alcohol dependence, which is the thing that’s going to have change before the depression is going to improve. But the good – the positive news is that people that we see coming into treatment with both alcohol dependence and depression, and it’s very, very common, the studies have shown 60-70% of people coming in to treatment for alcohol dependence are depressed, but the vast majority of them the depression improves very quickly after they stop drinking but they may have been suffering from depression for years.

Hughes

So what generally happens is that a patient may present with depression, they get prescribed an anti-depressant before the extent of their alcohol use has either been acknowledged by the individual themselves or picked up by a professional and the anti-depressant does not work, often they then re-present, they’re tried on a second anti-depressant and this was very common in my clinical practice – you see people on their second or third anti-depressant and they’re almost getting labelled as treatment resistant but in fact their alcohol misuse has not come to light. And we know very clearly from trials that in this situation the anti-depressant will not be doing anything to their alcohol consumption and will be having marginal if any effects on the depression. So the patient who says if you give me an anti-depressant I won’t be depressed anymore, it will make me feel better, then I won’t need to drink we can say that there is no evidence to support that.

Porter

Treating the wrong problem.

Hughes

Exactly, you have – whether or not you get treated for your depression you have to enter into treatment for your alcoholism. And that message has come up time and time again but unfortunately it is very hard and understandably hard when you have a depressed person in front of you who won’t go and seek help or even entertain the idea they may have a problem with alcohol, you can see why the clinical situation arises.

Drummond

There’s a kind of overlap of the two conditions and probably people who start out being depressed may well be taking alcohol as a form of medication to try and improve their mood which obviously it’s not going to do, it’s going to make it worse. Equally people who are alcohol dependent may well become depressed because of the chemical changes that the alcohol has in the brain.

Porter

But the simple message is that if you’re dealing with someone who has depression then it’s very important to ask them about their alcohol consumption.

Drummond

Absolutely, they’re going to be a high risk group for alcohol problems.

Porter

Now, you know that little voice in your head that questions if you’ve locked the car properly or turned the iron off. That uneasy feeling that you get when you think there is something that you should be doing, but you just can’t remember what it is?

More often than not these are groundless anxieties that simply reflect that many of us are born worriers, but sometimes that voice in your head - that gut feeling - warrants your attention.

And many doctors, particularly GPs, do pay it attention when faced with a patient that doesn’t quite fit the description in the textbook – all may appear well on the surface but you are left with a nagging doubt that all is not quite as it seems.

So are doctors right to heed their gut instincts? Ann Van Den Bruel is a GP and research fellow at the University of Oxford.

Van Den Bruel

A lot of GPs especially they recognise this feeling that they get sometimes although not everybody admits or acknowledges that they sometimes act upon it, it’s seen as something mysterious or maybe you should not talk about it. But it is real and when you talk to GPs about it they’re really happy to be able to share that experience of having this gut feeling and using it sometimes in their medical decision making. So it is something real but it’s not always acknowledged as a valid or a useful tool.

Porter

Well do we know if it’s useful?

Van Den Bruel

Well we do because we’ve been doing studies in, for example, serious infections in children, so that’s meningitis or pneumonia, and we have found that gut feeling is the most powerful predictor in general practice of a serious infection in a child.

Porter

But how do you go about measuring the effect of something like gut feeling?

Van Den Bruel

Well we asked doctors to record whether they felt something like gut feeling or an instinct that something was wrong in 4,000 children and then we compared those recordings with what ultimately happened to those children and we were able to calculate the diagnostic accuracy, if you want, of gut feeling. And we found that it is very, very accurate, it’s very useful. It’s not a hundred per cent right but the chance that something serious is going on is much higher when a doctor has a gut feeling.

Porter

Well Margaret McCartney’s been listening in from our Glasgow studio. Margaret, I suspect that none of this will come as a surprise to you.

McCartney

No and I think gut instinct is one of those real rich seams of general practice that kind of goes under explored and I think unacknowledged as well. When you talk to doctors over coffee one of the things that we’re always saying to each other is – just not quite sure about that lady or I’m just not quite sure about that hanging together. But I think there’s also a little bit of shame that goes along with it, I think sometimes it’s seen as being a bit unscientific – just having this gut instinct, this sort of feeling about someone and it’s a kind of slightly romantic idea that harks back to the old style videos of pictures of doctors just having a feeling about someone. For me it’s not unscientific at all, it’s actually highly scientific because what you’re doing is you’re saying actually out of all the people that I’ve seen with similar symptoms you’re just a bit different from everyone else, it’s almost like recognising that this person just doesn’t quite fit the pattern but you’re not quite sure in what way they don’t fit in with that pattern. So what you’re doing is you’re opening up to saying well I’m unsure, I’m uncertain and the possibilities here are potentially something quite serious and I’m not going to just let that go.

Porter

And this isn’t the only piece of evidence that suggests that it’s a powerful tool.

McCartney

No and what I find really fascinating is when you go and ask doctors around the world, as some researchers have done, do you experience a similar kind of phenomena, all doctors will say that they do. Some people will describe it as feeling something in their stomach, something just not quite right, other doctors will say that they feel it in their bones that something’s just not right and it’s just this idea that you get something that jars, something that just doesn’t quite fit properly together and you have a sense that you’re not actually very certain about what’s going on here at all.

Van Den Bruel

In general practice we have to deal with a lot of uncertainty, we don’t have all the tests and all the technology the hospital doctors do have and so we’re used to dealing with uncertainty and we’re used to not having that much at our disposal to make our decisions. So gut feeling for us is like our safety net, when we feel I’m not really happy about this then we may want to ask a second opinion or we may want to schedule another appointment or we may want to give the parents very detailed information on when to come back – that’s how we want to deal with that uncertainty that is left at the end of the consultation.

Porter

It’s interesting in this day and age because we’re very protocol driven, so examining a sick child, for instance, we look for pulse rate, the colour of their skin, tone, lots of other things that are laid out – there’s this little tick box that you can go through to evaluate whether a child is seriously ill or not. And what you’re saying is that the gut feeling’s not on that but we should be listening to our gut feeling.

Van Den Bruel

Yes, well I think first of all doctors should be doing it systematically and they should look at all the things that you just mentioned – colour, temperature, breathing rate – so that’s what they should do because they’re very, very useful in detecting serious illness. But on top of that they should also listen to their gut feeling – so when everything seems to be alright, when the breathing rate is normal and the temperature is not that abnormal, in addition to all these things when you have a gut feeling then you might pick up some children with a serious infection over and above what you have done in your tick box.

Porter

Another problem with our sort of modern healthcare system is that when you’re referring patients in for specialist treatment or for emergency treatment sometimes you are expected to jump through certain diagnostic hoops and you can’t really tick a box for gut instinct can you?



Van Den Bruel

No, I think healthcare should allow for flexibility in referrals, so we need the systematic referral process but we also need some flexibility to circumvent the systematic referral process where doctors are unhappy with presentation, doctors feel uneasy about this patient and they should be able to refer that patient despite a systematic examination being normal.

Porter

And what your research shows is that we shouldn’t be embarrassed about it, it’s a useful thing to have.

Van Den Bruel

Yes.

McCartney

I suppose this is what really frustrates me about the way that medicine is going. When I want to refer someone to hospital very often I’ve got a form to fill in and very often that form has lots of boxes that I have to tick on it and for example if I’m concerned that someone has a serious underlying bowel condition there is lots of boxes to tick – have you had blood in your stools, have you had diarrhoea, have you had weight loss – those kind of things are what we’d call red flag signals, something that’s quite definitively abnormal, something that’s not right. But in actual fact people don’t always come in like that, they’ll say well I’m just not quite sure, things are a little bit different normal but not terribly abnormal. And actually when you look through the data about doctors that refer patients outside strict guidelines actually when doctors are concerned very often there’s a good reason for that and the serious diagnoses that are uncovered through referrals with guidelines are actually relatively fairly high. So I think we really have to listen to this gut instinct and really enable doctors to work with it rather than trying to work against it all the time because I think it means something and I think it’s something very useful.

Porter

Are you implying that protocols are designed to guide us to improve our diagnostic skills on the one hand may actually be blunting this gut instinct on the other?

McCartney

I absolutely think so. Often guidelines are quite useful, they can help symptom sort, they can help out work out probabilities but they will not tell you about everyone and I think that doctors when they feel that something isn’t right we should be allowed to feel that something isn’t right and we should be able to refer people for further investigations when we’re concerned about them anyway. And I think sometimes with guidelines and being judged according to how well we follow guidelines is not really a way to embrace these kind of intuitions and use that to get our diagnostic skills better.

Porter

Fears over 'harmful' fake alcohol on sale across the UK,"Exclusive music news, big interviews, entertainment, social media trends and video from the news people at BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra.",['Anthony Baxter'],None,"There's a warning that fake alcohol containing harmful ingredients is being sold in the UK.

The Trading Standards Institute (TSI) says people should take extra care when buying alcohol over Christmas.

Officials say they are extremely concerned about the number of fake bottles being found on sale in off-licences across the UK.

In several areas thousands of litres of illegal alcohol have been recovered in the last few months.

Symptoms of alcohol poisoning Confusion



Loss of co-ordination



Vomiting



Irregular or slow breathing



Blue-tinged or pale skin



Low body temperature (hypothermia)



Stupor (being conscious but unresponsive)



Unconsciousness (passing out)

Often the bottles contain chemicals used in cleaning products and experts fear drinking them could be lethal.

More than 2,000 counterfeit bottles were seized during one week of raids across central parts of England in November.

Similar figures have been reported following raids in other areas.

The TSI says it's difficult to work out the scale of the problem, but its chief executive Ron Gainsford says the situation is getting worse.

""We are very concerned about this trend in the availability of fake alcohol,"" he said. ""It is not just about false bargains; counterfeit spirits and wine could be lethal.""

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) says it's worried people are risking their health by trying to save money.

In some cases it's thought fake bottles of vodka cost as little as £6.

Harmful chemicals

Amy Baskerville is a student from Bristol. Last month she bought what she thought was a cheaper brand of vodka.

""My partner had drunk half of the bottle when he noticed that he wasn't getting drunk,"" she said.

""We had a sniff and normally vodka has a kick of alcohol but this just smelt like nail varnish remover.""

Our bottle of vodka had chloroform, acetone and isopropyl alcohol in it Amy Baskerville Student

The 22-year-old says they both felt ill the next day, so contacted Trading Standards, who carried out tests.

""We were told that our bottle had chloroform, acetone and isopropyl alcohol in it.

""It was a couple of pounds cheaper than more well-branded vodkas. It's surprising how you go for the cheapest thing on the shelf.""

Some of those chemicals are also found in cleaning products.

Earlier this year five men were killed in an explosion at a garage in Boston in Lincolnshire. They had been making illegal vodka.

Health experts from the county say they're worried about the number of people coming into A&E thinking they've had their drink spiked, but actually they have been poisoned by fake alcohol.

Dr Vikas Sodiwala is a consultant in emergency medicine at Lincoln County hospital.

""We are seeing many more cases of patients coming in having said that their drinks have been spiked and I do think we are seeing an increase in awareness of the illicit alcohol that's out there,"" he said.

""The worst thing is if you drink too much of this stuff, you can get kidney failure, you can get liver failure. With methanol, particularly, it can lead to permanent blindness.""

Pete Evans - When I was 15 we had a crate of fake booze off a man in our pub. It never made us ill though.

Benji Mclean - We used to buy this fake whiskey, but it gave me a knee problem, felt like an arrow had been jabbed into my knee :( so I stopped buying it.

Andy Jeanes - I got offered some home made vodka in Russia once, but before I got to try it someone spilt theirs and it turned a red floor tile white and melted it. I politely declined.

Alan, Norfolk - While fake alcohol should be a big concern to us all it is only available in SOME small shops. I like most small shop retailers, would not even consider stocking it.

Anonymous - I bought a bottle of wine a few months ago from a corner shop. When I poured it out and took a sip I knew immediately it was not wine.

It was very yellow and tasted strange with notes of acetone and anti-freeze. Not what I usually look for in a wine!

Sean, Southampton - I've had fake vodka before. I had horrible, crippling stomach pains and felt ill for days. Never bought the cheap stuff since.

Guy, south London - if the government keeps hiking the prices of alcohol up then what do they expect?

Welsh Lib Dem William Powell AM warned on inappropriate behaviour,"Lib Dem AM William Powell has been given a formal written warning after a young activist complained of his inappropriate behaviour, it emerges.",[],None,"Image caption William Powell pictured during a debate in the Senedd

Lib Dem AM William Powell has been given a formal written warning after a young activist complained of his inappropriate behaviour, it has emerged.

The woman, now 21, alleged that in 2011 he gave her and two other women the strong alcoholic drink absinthe, touched her leg and put his hands round their waists.

The Mid and West Wales AM offered an unreserved apology.

The Lib Dems confirmed the warning.

The incident involving Mr Powell, his party's agriculture spokesman, was reported in the Daily Mail newspaper.

The article also refers to allegations about the behaviour of the former Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomeryshire Lembit Opik.

Anonymous

It claims he tried to kiss the activist when she was 17. Mr Opik denies the allegations.

In a statement on Saturday the Welsh Lib Dems said they received an anonymous complaint in May last year about William Powell's behaviour in an incident in June 2011, after the complainant had spoken to the chair of her local party.

She said she did not want to pursue a formal grievance procedure and wished to remain anonymous, but wanted the party to be aware of the issue.

The Welsh Lib Dems say the complaint was treated seriously, a report was compiled and passed to its chief whip in Cardiff Bay, Aled Roberts.

Mr Powell was interviewed by Mr Roberts and given a formal written warning that such behaviour would not be tolerated.

'Cooperated fully'

I apologised to the chief whip and offered an unreserved apology, through him, to anyone else for any hurt or offence caused William Powell, Mid and West Wales AM

He was told any future misdemeanour could result in ""more serious sanctions being imposed"".

The party says that no further complaint has been received since.

William Powell himself said in a statement: ""I am aware of an anonymous complaint having been made.

""The complaint was put to me by the chief whip and I cooperated fully with him in this matter.

""I apologised to the chief whip and offered an unreserved apology, through him, to anyone else for any hurt or offence caused and I would certainly wish to do so again, in writing or in person.""

The incident is a further embarrassment for the Liberal Democrats.

At Westminster they have suspended the MP Mike Hancock after a report into claims of sexual misconduct towards a female constituent was leaked, and suspended the party membership of Lord Rennard after he refused to apologise over claims of sexual harassment that he denies.","['unreserved', 'dem', 'william', 'welsh', 'lib', 'warned', 'behaviour', 'whip', 'party', 'powell', 'chief', 'inappropriate', 'complaint', 'offered', 'mr']","Image caption William Powell pictured during a debate in the SeneddLib Dem AM William Powell has been given a formal written warning after a young activist complained of his inappropriate behaviour, it has emerged.

The reason, say campaigners,...",[],None,"It's decision time on Britain's booze culture. Alcohol abuse is costing the country billions of pounds and robbing young people of their lives and their futures.

The reason, say campaigners, is that it's so cheap. You can buy two litres of cider, equivalent to a bottle of wine, for little more than a pound.

The answer, they say, is to force shops to charge a minimum price for alcohol. The Scottish government has tried and, so far, failed to promote the idea. Labour are examining it. The Tories have argued for minimum pricing for a limited range of super strength drinks.

The problem with the idea, some argue, is that it would punish the moderate majority for the sins of the few and, worse, might not really deal with the problem.

Tonight on Radio 4's Decision Time you can hear something rather extraordinary - Frank Dobson and John Redwood talking as if they were members of the same government about how this idea might or might not make its way through the corridors of power in Whitehall and Westminster

The former health secretary and the former head of the No 10 policy unit discuss, with the businessman who until last year was the head of the government's Better Regulation Executive, the potential obstacles and how to overcome them.

Drunk air passenger arrests up 50%,"A survey of 4,000 cabin crew also finds more than 25% had seen drunk passengers risk flight safety.",[],None,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A House of Lords committee report called for tougher rules on the sale of alcohol at airports

Arrests of passengers suspected of being drunk at UK airports and on flights have risen by 50% in a year, a BBC Panorama investigation suggests.

A total of 387 people were arrested between February 2016 and February 2017 - up from 255 the previous year.

Meanwhile, more than half of cabin crew who responded to a survey said they had witnessed disruptive drunken passenger behaviour at UK airports.

The Home Office is ""considering"" calls for tougher rules on alcohol.

The arrest figures obtained by Panorama came from 18 out of the 20 police forces with a major airport in their area.

Trade body Airlines UK said it should be made illegal for people to drink their own alcohol on board a plane.

'Barmaids in the sky'

A total of 19,000 of the Unite union's cabin crew members were surveyed and 4,000 responded, with one in five saying they had suffered physical abuse.

A former cabin crew manager with Virgin, Ally Murphy, quit her job last October after 14 years and told Panorama: ""People just see us as barmaids in the sky.

""They would touch your breasts, or they'd touch your bum or your legs. I've had hands going up my skirt before.""

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Ally Murphy: ""Drunk passenger tried to open plane door""

In July 2016 the aviation industry introduced a voluntary code of conduct on disruptive passengers, which most of the big airlines and airports signed up to.

The code's advice included asking retailers to warn passengers not to consume duty-free purchases on the plane, while staff were also asked not to sell alcohol to passengers who appeared drunk.

Panorama found more than a quarter of cabin crew surveyed were unaware of the code of practice and, of those who had heard of it, only 23% thought it was working.

One anonymous crew member told Panorama: ""The code of conduct isn't working… we're seeing these incidents on a daily, a weekly, a monthly basis. It's the alcohol mainly in the duty free that is the significant problem.""

Alcohol in the air

Entering an aircraft when drunk or being drunk on an aircraft is a criminal offence, with a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment

Licensing laws which prevent the sale of alcohol outside permitted hours do not apply to airside sales of alcohol at UK international airports. Bars can remain open to serve passengers on the earliest and latest flights - from 04:00 in some cases

About 270m passengers passed through UK airports last year* and about a fifth of all duty-free purchases involved wine and spirits**

The Civil Aviation Authority reported a 600% increase in disruptive passenger incidents in the UK between 2012 and 2016 with ""most involving alcohol"". They say the increase is partly down to improved reporting of incidents

Sources: Airlines UK* and UK Travel Retail Forum**

Manchester Airport is one of the signatories but when Panorama's undercover reporter asked at World Duty Free whether she could open alcohol bought at a duty free shop to consume on the plane, she was told ""officially probably not, unofficially I think you'll get away with it"". Another shop in the airport did give the right advice.

World Duty Free said it was committed to dealing with the issue and that it displays ""clear advisory notices at till points, on till receipts and on carrier bags that remind customers that alcohol purchases cannot be opened until their final destination is reached"".

Airlines UK, which represents carriers such as Virgin, British Airways and EasyJet, wants the government to amend the law to make consumption of a passenger's own alcohol on board an aircraft a criminal offence.

'There for one reason'

Airlines can limit the amount of alcohol sold to passengers on board flights.

Low-cost airline Jet2 has already banned alcohol sales on flights before 08:00 and managing director Phil Ward agreed further action was needed.

""I think they [airports] could do more. I think the retailers could do more as well.

""Two litre steins of beer in bars, mixes and miniatures in duty free shops, which can only be there for one reason - you know, they're items that are not sold on the high street.

""We can't allow it not to change.""

Your tales of drunken passengers:

""One passenger was so drunk he had to have a member of crew do up his seat belt. During landing we had passengers standing up, despite repeatedly being told to sit down. I heard the most despicable things, totally racist and sexist and disgusting."" Nikki Webber

""There was one woman whose language was vile all through the flight with the hen party. The last straw was once the plane had landed, she walked up the aisle and shouted the vilest language in front of my son."" Sharon Richards

""As the plane is landing... the lads remove their (seatbelts) and start scrapping really badly. I looked around and I saw one lad kick the girl behind me. They kicked me and without thinking about it I heard myself shouting really loudly at them to sit down and put their seatbelts back on."" Tania Chambers

""One passenger was so drunk by the end of the flight, he was unable to leave the aircraft unaided by the time we arrived. The departure time was before 8am."" Paul Shah

""I was seated just behind a stag group who had been drinking in the airport and continued to drink duty free clear spirits from water bottles on the flight. The airline staff did not serve any alcohol that flight and moved a family with young children."" David Moult

A House of Lords committee report earlier this year called for tougher rules on the sale of alcohol at airports.

Committee chair Baroness McIntosh of Pickering said: ""We didn't hear one shred of evidence to show the voluntary code was either working now or had any possible vestige of success in working any time soon.""

The Home Office said it was considering the report's recommendations, which include revoking the airports' exemption from the Licensing Act, ""and will respond in due course"".

Karen Dee, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, said: ""I don't accept that the airports don't sell alcohol responsibly. The sale of alcohol per se is not a problem. It's the misuse of it and drinking to excess and then behaving badly.""

She said they were working with retailers and staff to make sure they understand the rules.

Gambling in sport: John Hartson on how betting nearly cost his life,"With sportsmen three times more likely to gamble than the general population, why do so many risk so much on the 'betting buzz'?",[],1/8/2015 11:53,"There are myriad ways for people to gamble on sport in this day and age

Listen again to the full John Hartson interview in a BBC Radio 5 live Special on Gambling Addiction in Sport with Eleanor Oldroyd.

A fearless and robust striker, John Hartson's forthright response to being diagnosed with cancer came as little surprise to anybody who knew him well.

But there was one challenge ""Big John"" repeatedly shirked, his life-threatening addiction to gambling.

""You never think you've got a problem,"" he explained. ""You're a gambler, you enjoy it, you never realise the hurt you're causing.

""Your family know you're addicted, but I used to think they had the problem by questioning me.""

Then the questions stopped. Hartson's wife Sarah had had enough of him coming in from trips away, ignoring her and the children, going straight to the TV and turning on a cricket match, golf tournament or horse race he had £5,000 on.

So she packed her bags and told him she was leaving.

""I broke down and said I'd do something about this,"" the former Arsenal, West Ham and Celtic star remembered, his voice buckling with emotion and regret.

""When I was fighting for my life [with cancer], she was my rock. She was pregnant, she looked after the children, she was incredibly strong, and this scumbag here came out of hospital and carried on with the gambling, after everything she had done.

""I hit rock bottom and it takes that for you to realise - the penny dropped. I will never gamble again as long as I live.""

Hartson scored 206 goals in 505 club games in England and Scotland, and 14 in 51 games for Wales

'If I gamble again, I'll die'

Hartson's last bet was three years, three months and three days ago.

""Everybody is aware that cancer kills. It nearly took my life in 2009,"" the 39-year-old said, recalling the two emergency operations and more than 60 sessions of chemotherapy he needed when testicular cancer spread to his lungs and brain.

Media playback is not supported on this device Sportsmen more likely to be gamblers

""Cancer takes good people away every day, but, for me, gambling also kills.

""There are four places you can end up as a compulsive gambler: out on the street, in jail, dead, or at Gamblers Anonymous (GA).

""I ended up at GA, thank the Lord, and it's not only saved my marriage and made me a better person, it's also saved my life. If I gamble again, I'll die. I'll lose everything.

""I'm ultra-determined. I don't think about gambling today. I don't buy raffle tickets, I don't buy lottery tickets, I don't go to race tracks - I go to GA twice a week.

""I'll be going until I'm 70. Why wouldn't I? It's my medicine.""

Sportsmen are three times more likely to gamble

Hartson sees a lot of different people walk through the doors of those meetings - there are an estimated 400,000 people in the UK with a problem - but most of them do not come back. They have not reached their nadir yet.

""You're very selfish as a gambler, very deceitful. Compulsive gamblers are compulsive liars - they're very good at covering things up,"" said Hartson.

So good, in fact, many can appear, swan-like, to be gliding through life, holding down jobs, living in nice houses, with loving families. And a disproportionately large group can feed this destructive addiction whilst playing professional sport.

Former Cardiff and Sunderland striker Michael Chopra estimates he lost a total of £2m gambling

Hartson's testimony came at a conference organised by the Professional Players Federation (PPF) at Edgbaston Cricket Ground last month.

An umbrella body for the players' associations in cricket, football, rugby union and other leading sports, the PPF wanted to share some research into an issue that has been the stuff of terrace legend.

From jokes about QPR maverick Stan Bowles' inability to pass a bookmaker as well as he could pass a ball, to guesstimates of how many millions golf's favourite rogue John Daly has lost in Las Vegas, the idea that sport's competitive and wealthy young men were cash machines for the gambling industry has been commonplace.

Now, thanks to a study of almost 350 cricketers and footballers, we know sportsmen are three times more likely to have a gambling problem than young men in the general population (6.1% versus 1.9%).

That equates to nearly 200 current professionals in British cricket and football with a serious issue, and another 440 ""at risk"".

The study had a few more punches to deliver. One in 10 said they gambled to ""fit in"", one in four said they were encouraged by team-mates to do it, and nearly one in three thought their team's links with the gambling industry ""encouraged"" them to bet.

Media playback is not supported on this device Gillespie Focus

For football, in particular, that should be alarming.

A quarter of the Premier League's clubs have gambling logos on their shirts, the Football League's 72 clubs play in competitions sponsored by Sky Bet, William Hill backs the Football Association and pretty much every club has its own ""official betting partner"".

The highest suicide rate of any addiction

Sporting Chance's chief executive Colin Bland revealed that seven out of 10 of the footballers that come to the Tony Adams-inspired residential clinic are there because of gambling.

But Hartson is not looking for excuses. He realises the vast majority of people gamble rarely, and when they do, they do it because it is fun.

While he may have been frittering away a reported £50,000 a week - he does not put a figure on it himself, as the amounts addicts gamble is relative to their earnings and it is always too much - his dad takes his business clients to Ffos Las racecourse once a year for champagne and £20 each-way punts. ""Not everybody gets drawn in,"" he noted.

But some who do get it bad: gambling has the highest suicide rate of any addiction.

Niall McNamee (in green, playing for Offaly) contemplated suicide when his gambling got out of hand

Sitting alongside Hartson during the conference's main session was Gaelic footballer Niall McNamee. He told a similar tale of the disease's progressive nature - moments of relief that became more fleeting as tolerance to betting's buzz builds.

But he also spoke about bad company, lies, stealing and, ultimately, despair.

""I remember waking up one morning with a knot in my stomach,"" said McNamee. ""It was the most gut-wrenching pain. I had no money to go gambling with, or to buy drink to numb the pain.

""The thought came to me that if I jumped out of the window that would end it all. It terrified me. I have had friends who have died from this addiction.""

Thankfully, this was his rock bottom, and he got help. McNamee, who is still one of the game's top forwards, is now a well-respected voice on problem gambling in Ireland, and at 29 is about to launch his own business.

'I should be living in a £4m mansion'

For Hartson, the first symptoms appeared as an 11-year-old potboy at a social club in Swansea. Fascinated by the fruit machines, he memorised the reels and was called over by the adults whenever they had a few nudges.

It sounds innocent enough, but before long he was pouring his money into those machines and begging for money for match fees at the weekend. A decade later he would have accounts with all the top bookmakers and was so consumed by gambling that he would struggle to hold a serious conversation.

Hartson is still a hero among fans of Celtic, where he scored more than 100 goals in a five-year spell

""I can concentrate now and focus on what people are saying, but five years ago I couldn't,"" he admitted. ""My life is so much better now. I'm a better husband, a better father, and I've got money coming out of my ears!""

And just as his cancer foundation is helping people deal with that affliction, he now hopes he can persuade a few footballers to think about their futures.

""I was in a lot of trouble physically and mentally when I quit,"" said Hartson, who went out with a whimper at West Brom.

""I should be living in a £4m mansion on the edge of the Vale of Glamorgan but I'm not because of all the money I wasted. I've got a nice house in Swansea, and it's paid for, but that's what I should have when you think about the money I earned.

""I would like players now to aspire to the big house.""

'We're at a tipping point'

Betting is an integral part of our culture - three quarters of the UK's adult population have gambled, most likely on the National Lottery, in the past year - and betting companies have moved into the sponsorship space vacated by tobacco and, to a lesser extent, alcohol. Without them many sports would struggle.

But listening to the speakers at the conference, it was impossible to avoid the conclusion that British sport needs to look again at its relationship with gambling.

Former Gloucestershire and New Zealand cricketer Craig Spearman said that when his gambling problem escalated, ""at times the pain and self-loathing pushed me to the brink"".

More must be done to protect the vulnerable, identify problems earlier and make sure gambling is a happy mug's game, not a debilitating illness.

Simon Barker, the assistant chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, notes that prevention through education is cheaper than emergency interventions. His counterpart at the Professional Cricketers' Association, Jason Ratcliffe, said sport was only ""scratching the surface"" in terms of what was needed.

The Responsible Gambling Trust's chief executive Marc Etches has managed to persuade the gambling industry to donate more than £6m of its profits to fund education and treatment, but he knows it is not enough.

""We're at a tipping point,"" said Etches. ""The industry needs to recognise that it's in the business of risk, and it needs to take more responsibility.""

FA crackdown on players betting on football Since the start of the 2014-15 season, the FA's new betting rules forbid players, managers, club employees and match officials to place any bet on any football matter. This includes not just domestic matches and competitions in England but any football worldwide. This does not just apply to the results of games, competitions or events that take place in them, it also covers other football events such as manager appointments and player transfers. These rules apply to bets made in person, online, on the telephone or with friends. Participants are also not allowed to instruct any third party to place any bet on their behalf.

Kenya arrests over deaths from illicit alcohol trade,"Two people have been arrested in Kenya after the deaths of 70 people from drinking illicit alcohol, amid growing anger over the incident.",[],None,"Image caption Relative of those who died in Kiambu county are in shock

Two people have been arrested following the deaths of 70 people in Kenya after drinking homemade alcohol believed to be laced with industrial chemicals.

Police are hunting for other brewers who have gone into hiding since their customers died or went blind.

The BBC's Frenny Jowi says some Kenyans are angry that more is not being done to clamp down on the illicit trade.

Officials in the five areas where the deaths occurred have been indefinitely suspended, the government says.

Image caption Alice Wairumu lost her husband and two adult sons

Consumption of homemade brew is popular in Kenya, where many people cannot afford to buy standardised alcohol.

My husband told me that he was seeing everything in blue, I asked him if the cow was blue, he said 'yes' Alice Wairumu , Kiambu resident

Officials say the alcohol consumed on Sunday in five counties of Central and Eastern Provinces may have contained methanol - a toxic substance used to boost the strength of the drink.

Our correspondent says such liquors are often known locally as ""changaa"" or ""kumi kumi"" and most villages will have a producer who is usually illicit.

In a move to regulate the trade in 2010 the government allowed production as long as it was commercially bottled and sold at licensed premises.

This led to some producers branding their drinks, but the plastic bottles the liquor comes in are easily adulterated and can be injected with chemicals, our correspondent says.

'Drinkers hid in bushes'

Relatives of those who died in Kiambu county, an hour's drive from the capital, Nairobi, are in shock, she says.

Alice Wairumu said she lost her two adult sons and her husband.

Here a man illegally distils changaa in a slum in the capital, Nairobi, as he looks out the window for the potential arrival of police. In pictures: Kenya's traditional brewers

""On Monday they started to feel unwell; they didn't go to work at the construction site as usual. Later I had to take them to hospital for treatment,"" Ms Wairumu told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme.

""After being discharged, my husband told me that he was seeing everything in blue, I asked him if the cow was blue, he said 'yes',"" she said.

According to government figures, 10 people died in Kiambu, a lush agricultural area where many people who work on tea and coffee plantations are poor.

Ms Wairumu's brother-in-law, Joseph Mau, said this included two of those involved in brewing in the area.

""This place is conducive for drinking because we have bushes here and these drinkers have places to hide when they hear the police coming,"" he said, adding that this was why Kiambu attracted drinkers from surrounding areas.

A woman in Kiambu's small shopping centre told the BBC she had managed to send her son to rehab but many young men were being lost to ""poisonous"" brews.

Other residents expressed despair about the situation, our reporter says.

Under Kenyan law, those who are found guilty of adulterating alcoholic drinks can by jailed for five years or face a $114,800 (£67,713) fine.

Those who died had drunk liquor from different producers in Embu, Kiambu, Kitui, Makueni and Murang'a counties.

Our reporter says there is a possibility that they all bought their chemicals from the same dealer.

A government statement said 181 people were still in hospital being treated.

It also advised Kenyans to avoid ""taking alcoholic drinks packaged in sachets, plastic bottles and jerry cans because such drinks are easily adulterated"".

In 2005, more than 45 people died after drinking illegal alcohol laced with methanol.","['alcohol', 'died', 'drinks', 'blue', 'changaa', 'trade', 'kiambu', 'told', 'wairumu', 'drinking', 'arrests', 'deaths', 'husband', 'kenya', 'illicit', 'lost']","The BBC's Frenny Jowi says some Kenyans are angry that more is not being done to clamp down on the illicit trade.

#FindMissWard: Author finds English teacher 40 years on,,[],2018-02-01 12:05:57+00:00,"Image copyright Twitter/Chris Young Image caption Chris Young was 13 when Lyn Ward taught him English

An author has tracked down the English teacher who supported him 40 years ago when his mother died thanks to a mass social media search.

Chris Young appealed on Twitter to help find Lyn Ward, who taught at Lodge Park School in Corby in 1978.

Miss Ward was found via Mr Young's former music teacher Gill Manning and with the help of 30,000 retweets and responses to his search.

Mr Young, 52, said it was ""like meeting one of your childhood heroes"".

Sorry, this Twitter post is currently unavailable.

Mr Young said: ""I don't have the words to describe how I feel. I'm so incredibly thrilled and excited. It's like meeting one of your childhood heroes.""

He was 12 when his mother died and his alcoholic father was unable to cope.

He said Miss Ward ""treated me like a rock star, loved what I wrote and got me to talk in front of the class"" and he moved from the bottom quarter to fourth in the year.

Mr Young's quest to find her saw teachers at the school ""firing off emails in the hope one would land"" to former staff.

Miss Manning said she had a phone number and address for her, but the number turned out to be wrong.

But it was not over then as the address proved to be correct and Miss Ward, who has since changed her name and wishes to remain anonymous, contacted Mr Young on email last week.

He said: ""She was gobsmacked and swept away by it all.

""The phrase that summed it up for me was that she felt she was the cat that got the cream.

""I never lost hope [of finding her] because the effect this lovely woman had on my life had already been made.""

Lodge Park's principal Leo Gilbert said it was a wonderfully ""heart-warming story"".

""I've never known a teacher that has gone into teaching to be thanked. But we can all remember those teachers that make the positive impact on our lives,"" Mr Gilbert said.

""This [finding Miss Ward] is the sort of thing that makes your day.""

Chris Evans: PHEW,The official blog for Chris Evans on BBC Radio 2,[],None,"PHEW

What a week that was. Up and down like a rollercoaster. Talking of rollercoaster’s...

…this weekend I have one all to myself. Tomorrow at Alton Towers I’m recording the launch film for this years Comic Relief, which involves me riding on the big dipper there several times totally on my own. The director has told me three times should be enough but of course he is lying. Knowing film crews and directors as I do I’ll be lucky to get off there before midnight.

The scenario or the plot if you like for the trail revolves around me telling the boys from McFly that they do not meet the height requirements for any of the big rides at the famed theme park. They then slope off to console themselves with candyfloss and cokes whilst I meglomanically claim another preposterous victory. It all sound hilarious doesn’t it? As long as is does the trick what does it really matter?

Been asked by the BBC to consider fronting a new cookery show! Apparently, one of the big wigs saw me on Saturday Kitchen and liked the cut of my apron. The format, without giving too much away, well actually I can’t tell you. Nice to be back in the wanted box, will see what happens. One thing is for sure, anything that takes away from my focus on our little radio show will not be an option.

All Request Friday kicks in again tonight. It’s up to you whether we rock and roll or not. So get your thinking caps on if you can be bothered.

In the meantime have a cracking weekend and keep your paintbrush wet.

Five Hillsborough myths dispelled by inquests jury,The alleged behaviour of fans lay at the heart of the myths rejected by the Hillsborough inquests. How were they perpetuated?,"['Richard Turner', 'Bbc News Online']",None,"Image copyright Hillsborough Inquests Image caption The alleged behaviour of fans lay at the heart of the myths rejected by the inquests

Five myths about Liverpool fans' behaviour on the day of the Hillsborough disaster were among the main obstacles for families seeking justice. What do we now know about how they were perpetuated?

The Hillsborough inquests jury concluded it was police - not fans - who caused or contributed to the deaths of 96 men, women and children who it said were unlawfully killed following a series of failures by police, the ambulance service, as well as defects in the stadium.

The behaviour of supporters, the jury said, played no part in the 1989 disaster.

The families campaigned for 27 years for the truth despite lies told by senior officers, slurs in national newspapers and an alleged police cover-up to deflect blame on to supporters.

Myth 1: Liverpool fans arrived 'late and without tickets'

After the disaster, allegations emerged from ""unnamed sources"" - later established to be a Police Federation spokesman and the Sheffield Conservative MP, Irvine Patnick - claiming Liverpool supporters had ""deliberately arrived late determined to force entry"" to the ground.

What we know: While many Liverpool supporters did arrive after 14.30, evidence to the inquests suggested it was actually the police ""failure to control the crowd"" and ""inadequate"" turnstiles that led to the fatal crush.

The claim that fans had ""deliberately arrived late"" formed the basis of the ""rock solid"" defence South Yorkshire Police [SYP] sought to present at the 1989 Taylor inquiry into the disaster. The aim was to ""deflect blame on to supporters"" and exonerate the police.

The jury heard from former South Yorkshire Police inspector Clive Davis who recalled being told by former Ch Supt Terry Wain ""to put the blame for this disaster where it belongs: on the drunken, ticketless Liverpool fans"". This was denied in evidence by Mr Wain. However, he admitted a report he prepared had exaggerated claims that ""several thousand"" spectators had arrived at the ground within minutes of kick-off.

The inquests heard the 10,100 fans with standing tickets for the Leppings Lane end were expected to enter through just seven turnstiles, causing congestion outside the ground.

Lord Justice Taylor, in his 1990 report into the disaster, concluded fans were reasonable to arrive between 14.30 and 14.40 as match tickets only requested people be in their places ""15 minutes before the game"". He was also satisfied that the large concentration of fans who gathered Leppings Lane at 14.40 to 14.50 ""did not arrive as a result of any concerted plan"".

He concluded that police had ""failed"" to prepare for controlling the arrival of a large number of fans in a short period. Both the club and police ""should have realised the turnstile area could not easily cope with the large numbers demanded of it"" unless they arrived steadily over a lengthy period.

He accepted there were ""small groups without tickets"" looking to ""exploit any chance of getting into the ground"". But the main problem was simply one of ""large numbers packed into the small area outside the turnstiles"". He stated categorically that ""fans' behaviour played no part in the disaster"".

The Hillsborough Independent Panel (HIP) report concluded crowd congestion outside the stadium was ""not caused by fans arriving late"" for the kick-off. The turnstiles, it said, were ""inadequate to process the crowd safely"" and the rate of entry insufficient to prevent a dangerous build-up outside the ground.

What the jury said: The behaviour of Liverpool supporters did not cause or contribute to the dangerous situation at the Leppings Lane turnstiles.

Myth 2: 'Drunken fans caused the disaster'

Image copyright AP Image caption Police tried to shift the blame for the disaster onto ""drunken"" fans but the inquest jury did not agree

Myth: In the days following the tragedy, some newspapers reported that a ""crazed surge"" of Liverpool fans, many the ""worse for drink, others without tickets"" had raced to the stadium causing the deaths of 96 people in the stadium. Reports quoted police witnesses describing fans as ""lager-louts"" or even as ""animals"".

What we know: The chief constable of South Yorkshire Police at the time of the Hillsborough disaster told officers if anyone was to blame it was ""drunken ticketless"" fans. The comments by Sir Peter Wright were revealed in minutes from a South Yorkshire Police Federation meeting, held four days after the 1989 tragedy.

They were read to the inquests jury during evidence from Paul Middup, who was then the federation's secretary. Mr Middup was quoted in several newspapers in the days following the 15 April 1989 disaster, claiming some supporters at the Liverpool versus Nottingham Forest match had been ""tanked up"".

A number of police officers told the inquests that fans were drinking before the match. One of them, a Sgt Lomas, said he had never before seen so much alcohol consumed before a match - ""beer, cider, wine, big bottles, cans, carafes of wine; a wide array of different drink"". Some fans were ""unsteady on their feet"", he told the jury.

The Hillsborough Inquests heard an allegation that former SYP chief inspector Sir Norman Bettison had been asked to ""concoct a story"" that ""all the Liverpool fans were drunk and that we were afraid they were going to break down the gates, so we decided to open them"". This was strongly denied by Sir Norman.

The Taylor Report, while accepting there was a ""drunken minority"" of fans, said they did not cause the congestion at the turnstiles. The coroner Sir John Goldring told the jury that more than half of the victims of the disaster had either no alcohol in their blood or an amount which was entirely negligible. Most of the others had levels ""consistent with only modest social drinking before a sporting event"".

His 1989 report said that, while many supporters who arrived at 2.30pm or after, had been drinking, the great majority ""were not drunk nor even the worse for drink"". Evidence from shops and off licences on the way to the ground ""did not suggest a great amount of alcoholic drink was bought there"".

Others described a generally normal crowd with an uncooperative minority who had drunk too much. In his view, ""many officers overestimated"" the drunken element in the crowd. He concluded that ""drunkenness played no part in the disaster"".

The HIP report found that, of the 95 individuals who died as an immediate result of the disaster, only six had alcohol levels at which they may have been expected to show ""signs of being intoxicated"". The recording of blood alcohol levels in victims and questioning of bereaved families about their drinking habits proved highly controversial and upsetting at the time.

The panel also found ""no evidence... to verify the serious allegations of exceptional levels of drunkenness, ticketlessness or violence among Liverpool fans"".

What the jury said: The jury found nothing to suggest that the behaviour of fans, drunken or otherwise, contributed to the disaster.

Myth 3: Supporters 'forced an exit gate'

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Ch Supt David Duckenfield admitted that he lied when told key people at Hillsborough that fans had ""forced a gate""

Myth: The sudden inrush of 2,000 fans which led to the fatal crushing on the terraces was caused by Liverpool fans who ""forced a gate"" to enter the stadium. This was a lie told by match commander David Duckenfield.

What we know: How so many fans entered the ground just a few minutes before kick-off lies at the centre of the Hillsborough disaster. The allegation that fans had forced their way in through exit gate C came from match commander David Duckenfield. However, he admitted at the inquests that this had been a lie.

Knowing full well that it was he who had ordered the gate to be opened, he instead told the FA Chief Executive Graham Kelly and the Sheffield Wednesday FC club secretary Graham Mackrell in the police control box that ""a gate had been forced and there had been an inrush of Liverpool supporters"". This lie was later presented to the media as the official police version of events and heavily influenced newspaper reports of the tragedy.

Giving evidence at the Hillsborough Inquests, Mr Duckenfield admitted: ""Everybody knew the truth. The fans and police knew the truth that we'd opened the gates."" The jury was asked to consider why he lied - whether it was in panic or fear of public disorder. Or because Mr Duckenfield knew his actions beforehand were responsible for the crushing in the pens. Mr Duckenfield also admitted failing to tell Mr Kelly and Mr Mackrell that it was his order to open the exit gate C - a ""lie by omission"", he told the jury.

The inquests were told that Mr Duckenfield's lie, shared in good faith with the media by the FA chief executive Graham Kelly, led to some seriously inaccurate reporting of events.

Myth 4: 'Hooliganism caused the Hillsborough disaster'

Image copyright Hillsborough Inquests Image caption Perimeter fencing was added at Hillsborough in 1977 to prevent possible pitch invasions

Myth: The fatal crush was caused by a ""crazed surge"" of Liverpool football hooligans, some newspapers reported.

What we know: Preventing and controlling crowd disorder had a ""profound effect on football"" in the 1970s and 1980s, Sir John Goldring, the coroner at the inquests stated. Four years before the disaster, a group of Liverpool fans were blamed for causing the Heysel disaster, in which 39 Juventus supporters died when a wall collapsed at the 1985 European Cup Final in Brussels. In his summing up, Sir John reminded the jury that the scourge, known as ""the English disease"", was a serious problem at the time. During the early 1970s, fighting between fans and pitch invasions made it necessary to prevent access to the playing area and the perimeter fences were erected at grounds like Hillsborough in 1977.

However, he said that Liverpool supporters ""did not have a reputation for violence"" and told jurors ""there is no suggestion that the Hillsborough disaster was caused by hooliganism"".

By the time of the 1989 semi-final, the fear of hooliganism was still a ""major problem"" and had a huge bearing both on the police planning for the match and the design of the stadium, the inquests heard. This was evident from the police Operational Order for the match which emphasised the ""prevention of disorder"" and in particular ""prevention of access to the field of play"".

The report by the Hillsborough Independent Panel said that, while safety was a concern for police, the ""prevention of hooliganism"" and ""public disorder"" was the main priority. The practice of packing the pens was ""concerned primarily with controlling the crowd"", it said. In evidence, Mr Duckenfield conceded that operational police orders placed ""more emphasis on preventing disorder than public safety"".

Lord Justice Taylor was clear in his interim report that ""hooliganism"" played no part in the 1989 disaster. On the contrary, it was the fear of hooliganism in police circles that led to ""an imbalance between the need to quell a minority of troublemakers and the need to secure the safety and comfort of the majority"".

Myth 5: Fans 'urinated on police' and 'stole from the dead'

Image copyright Hillsborough Inquests

Myth: Four days after the disaster, The Sun newspaper published its now infamous front page under the headline ""The Truth"" claiming some fans had ""picked the pockets of victims"" and had ""urinated on a woman police officer"" who was trying to help the dying. Other regional and national newspapers published similar allegations, although less prominently.

What we know: The article was based on a story filed by White's news agency in Sheffield that quoted ""unnamed officers"" as well as the Conservative MP for Sheffield Irvine Patnick. This slur on fans' behaviour originated from police inspector Gordon Sykes who, while giving evidence at the inquests, admitted sharing unfounded allegations by Hillsborough officers with Paul Middup, the secretary of the South Yorkshire Police Federation, and Mr Patnick. White's later admitted that the source of the ""unsolicited"" claims came from four ""high ranking"" SYP officers.

At the inquests, Mr Sykes accepted The Sun's story was ""unfair"" and a ""distortion"" of what happened and that he regretted sharing unfounded allegations he made about Liverpool fans pick-pocketing the dead. He told the jury he had reported what he heard in 1989 and had ""honestly believed"" the allegations were true.

Mr Sykes agreed there was a mood among the police that they were being ""blamed for the entirety of the tragedy"" and officers felt that should be ""addressed"". He also agreed with Paul Greaney QC, who represents the Police Federation, who said that mood was ""was being driven by the Chief Constable himself"".

In 2012, the former Sun editor Kelvin McKenzie apologised to the people of Liverpool for The Truth headline saying he had been ""misled"". In a statement, he said: ""These allegations were wholly untrue and were part of a concerted plot by police officers to discredit the supporters thereby shifting the blame for the tragedy from themselves.

""It would have been far more accurate had I written the headline The Lies rather than The Truth,"" he said.","['fans', 'report', 'disaster', 'inquests', 'told', 'dispelled', 'jury', 'hillsborough', 'myths', 'liverpool', 'supporters', 'mr']","Image copyright Hillsborough Inquests Image caption The alleged behaviour of fans lay at the heart of the myths rejected by the inquestsFive myths about Liverpool fans' behaviour on the day of the Hillsborough disaster were among the main obstacles for families seeking justice.

Amsterdam alcoholics paid in beer for collecting litter,A group of alcoholics is being paid in beer to clean the streets of Amsterdam.

Alcoholics are being paid in beer to clean the streets of Amsterdam as part of a project partly funded by the Dutch government - the organisers think other countries should abandon ""old-fashioned political correctness"" and adopt the same approach.

Rene scours the streets, grasping at discarded wrappers.

His movements are fuelled by a tangible pride. It is an unfamiliar emotion for a man whose alcohol addiction has cost him so much.

""I have four children and three ex-wives, but alcohol has finished everything. I don't see them, they don't know where I am, or if I am alive. Now I have only him. He is there for 30 years, when times are good and bad, he is always there,"" he says, referring to his habit.

His affectionate gaze travels downwards. It rests on an aluminium can.

Chronic alcoholics have congregated inside a communal space, commandeered by the Rainbow Group. It is a private but primarily government-funded company, which helps those struggling to cope due to homelessness, drug abuse or alcoholism.

A gas heater emanates warmth; someone hums along to the theme tune from Armageddon.

Rene, 52, has just cracked open his third can of the day. It has just gone 11:30 in the morning.

Image caption Rene has four children and three ex-wives but now he is devoted to alcohol

He is one of 20 alcoholics who have joined this initiative. They arrive at 09:00 and work until 15:00. They take extended breaks for beer, cigarettes and a hot lunch, all provided free of charge.

The distinctive aroma of stamppot, a traditional Dutch vegetable stew, wafts through from the kitchen.

The air is hazy with smoke and camaraderie; another pop anthem fills the room with nostalgia.

""They like to cook and you see qualities they didn't even know they had,"" says Janet van de Noord, who runs the Rainbow Group's litter project.

'Cost-effective'

""It's quite difficult to get these people off the alcohol completely. We have tried everything else. Now this is the only thing that works. We might not make them better, but we are giving them a better quality of life and it's better for the neighbourhood, they're giving something back to society.""

Inside an oversized garden shed, decorated with Ajax football paraphernalia, about 6,000 cans of beer are stacked in crates.

The Rainbow Group is reluctant to say exactly how much the Dutch government pays towards the free beer, cautious of generating any negative publicity that might jeopardise their funding.

But Ms van de Noord argues it is a cost-effective way to tackle the impact of alcoholism. ""If people are being arrested, it also costs society a lot of money. So this can only be a good thing. I don't see why other countries wouldn't want to do it.""

When I asked other Dutch people about the project they all spoke in favour of it.

Ten minutes' walk from the now litter-free streets lies Amsterdam's Oosterpark.

Image caption Oosterpark is no longer strewn with litter but some alcoholics have not been persuaded to give up their park benches

Fountains propel shimmering bursts of water; leaves create an autumnal collage on the path.

This slice of Dutch life is interrupted by a man staggering towards us. ""Mooooi!"" (""beautiful"") he says, greeting us with a sleazy smile. But he quickly makes it clear that he and his friends do not wish to be interviewed.

He is one of the remaining alcoholics who have not been persuaded to abandon their park benches.

Since the street-cleaning programme started 12 months ago, local police have received fewer reports of stabbings and muggings in the park. And all of the residents we spoke to said they were happy with the government supporting this unconventional approach.

Instead of being ostracised by society, the alcoholics' needs appear to have been incorporated into the Dutch healthcare system.

The Rainbow Group is optimistic their success so far will attract more funding and help them to reach the unreachable. Other cities in the Netherlands are now considering introducing similar schemes.

Floor van Bakkum of Amsterdam's Jellinek anti-addiction clinic says the project is a good way to deal with ""a very problematic group - it's kind of harm reduction"". She likened it to giving carefully monitored methadone or heroin doses to chronic heroin addicts.

""It might help them to do something else with their life. You always have to monitor such a project, so it shouldn't attract new alcoholics - it's not an open invitation to drink in Oosterpark."" She said such a scheme would be inappropriate for alcoholics who still live at home and have a job.

'Unchangeable reality'

Back on litter duty, Rene tells me about his past life - expensive cars, extensive travel and some details best not shared. But, he insists, he is happier now, with nothing.

He detects our incredulity: ""You don't believe me? Trust me, if I could have my life again I would give it all up for this.

""I know he will never expect anything from me or let me down. Now I am free,"" he says, referring to the drink habit.

Some might wonder, how free can an addict be?

But the founders of this project treat this addiction as an ""unchangeable reality"" and tackle it using the only device that is guaranteed to connect with the patients.

""I come for the beer. If there was no beer then why would I come?"" says Rene.

Regardless of their motivations, Rene and his friends are making a positive difference in a community where they were once despised.

""It's true,"" Rene concedes, acknowledging the irony. ""They used to treat us like garbage - and now we are picking up their garbage, we are not the garbage anymore.""","['amsterdam', 'streets', 'project', 'group', 'collecting', 'alcoholics', 'beer', 'dutch', 'litter', 'rainbow', 'rene', 'life', 'paid']","Chronic alcoholics have congregated inside a communal space, commandeered by the Rainbow Group.

Amanda Hutton 'threatened eldest son' after Hamzah Khan death,"A woman who let her four-year-old son starve to death threatened to kill her other children if her eldest son called police, a judge hears.",[],None,"Image caption The prosecution said the cause of Hamzah Khan's death was ""blindingly obvious""

A mother who allowed her four-year-old son to starve to death told his older brother not to tell anyone or she would kill his siblings, a judge has heard.

Alcoholic mother-of-eight Amanda Hutton is being sentenced for the manslaughter of her four-year-old Hamzah Khan.

His mummified remains were found in squalid conditions at their Bradford home in 2011, 21 months after he died.

The judge is hearing submissions from the prosecution and defence before he decides Hutton's sentence.

Better to be safe than sorry Neighbour on making an anonymous call to social services

The court is also hearing details of the involvement with the family of agencies including social services and the police.

Tariq Khan, one of Hutton's two adult sons, has admitted preventing the burial of Hamzah's body and will also be sentenced later.

Packed courtroom

The judge, Roger Thomas, the Recorder of Bradford, heard Khan told police during interviews that his mother had threatened to kill her other children to prevent him from calling the authorities after Hamzah's death.

Tariq also told probation officers how his mother held a knife to the throat of one of the children two days after Hamzah's death.

He also said his mother threatened to burn down the house, the court heard.

The judge was told that one of Hutton's neighbours alerted social services to her concerns about the family in March 2011, but her actions did not result in Hamzah's body being found.

Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, said the woman had observed children crying and not being comforted, threatening voices towards the children, blinds never being open and children not playing outside.

In a text message the woman wrote about her anonymous call to social services, she wrote: ""Better to be safe than sorry.""

Mr Greaney told the judge the history of what happened after this was ""complex"", but social services, education services and the police ""were all involved to a greater or lesser extent"".

He said a serious case review into Hamzah's death was under way.

The prosecutor said whatever was or was not done by the relevant agencies ""should not detract from the shocking and disgraceful conduct of Amanda Hutton involving six of her children"".

""She killed Hamzah, no-one else,"" he said.

BBC Look North reporter Dave Edwards said the interest in the case was such that the courtroom was ""so full that security guards have been drafted in and people are being turned away"".

Hutton is being sentenced for manslaughter, child neglect and preventing the burial of Hamzah's body.

The child neglect charges relate to each of Hamzah's five siblings living at the house, who were aged between five and 13 in 2011.","['death', 'khan', 'amanda', 'hamzahs', 'hutton', 'judge', 'told', 'son', 'hamzah', 'sentenced', 'eldest', 'social', 'services', 'threatened', 'children', 'mother', 'preventing']","Alcoholic mother-of-eight Amanda Hutton is being sentenced for the manslaughter of her four-year-old Hamzah Khan.

Gin is the tonic for a creative boom in the drinks business,,[],12/15/2011 12:35,"BBC Radio 4, In Business

Four centuries after gin was introduced to Britain, a new generation of boutique distilleries - some in residential homes - is driving a British gin revival.

Behind an anonymous door in an office block in north London, serious-looking women wearing white lab coats are pouring and measuring liquids.

A machine spins away on a counter, and off to the side something white and viscous is bubbling away in a flask.

The din of machinery and hushed whispers in technical language bring to mind medical research or nuclear science.

But all of this activity is dedicated to the art of the cocktail - and much of it is devoted to finding the perfect companion to the queen of spirits, gin.

Remixing a classic

Tony Conigliaro is the chief bartender - he eschews the term ""mixologist"" - and his lab is constantly making new raw materials for his two cocktail bars, as well as undertaking research for outside clients.

""With the influence of chefs around the world, we wanted to match that with a level of accuracy and new innovative ideas, flavours and flavour combinations,"" he says.

The lab's shelves are lined with herbs, spices and plants such as dandelion leaf, Szechuan pepper, angelica root, hibiscus, lemon verbena, white chocolate and nettle - all building blocks for new drinks.

Of course, cocktails have long been on the menu in British bars and pubs.

But instead of sweet fizzy drinks and easily chugged shots, these are concoctions for a more sophisticated drinker.

And the real key to Conigliaro's recipes lies in the alcoholic kick provided by a new breed of distillers.

""There's some really interesting gins coming out,"" he says.

""Their structure is interesting and they're using new botanicals. What's being produced is phenomenal.

""We're selling more gin martinis than ever before,"" he says. ""Considering it's 80% gin, that means that people are liking gin.""

Domestic distilleries

London is in the midst of a craft distilling revival.

New microdistilleries can be found in residential houses - such as Sacred Spirits, based in London's sedate Highgate. And they're tucked away in terraces - such as gin and vodka makers Sipsmith in Hammersmith.

These new distillers are a far cry from the back-street operators who turned out rough booze in the 19th Century.

The gory excess of London's spirit craze at that time was gruesomely portrayed in the artwork of George Cruikshank and William Hogarth - whose print Gin Lane depicts dead babies, binge-drinking children and starving alcoholics.

It is not exactly a refined image of alcohol - but despite this, some of today's gin makers still take a measure of inspiration from the past.

""We try to reflect the old school way of distilling, which is known as one-shot,"" says Sipsmith co-founder Sam Galsworthy.

He proudly shows off Prudence - distillers traditionally give their stills female names.

She is an impressively gleaming room-sized copper machine, but she could easily fit several times over in just one of the stills used by bigger spirits brands.

""We do not blend, we do not make a concentrate,"" Galsworthy says.

""People are drinking less, but they are drinking better. If they're going to have a gin and tonic, they're going to have a better gin and tonic, they're just going to have it less frequently.

""That is one of the indicators that will happen in a recession.""

Next big gin

And since gin is often mentioned in the same breath as tonic, perhaps it is no surprise that other businesspeople have opted to remix the mixer.

Co-founder Charles Rolls used to work for Plymouth Gin, but he grew to hate the metallic flavour and bitter aftertaste of saccharin - the dominant sweetener in most tonic waters today.

""I was always frustrated by the fact that when we could show the differences between these great gins - the way they smell with the different botanicals - when you went to mix them, they always just smelt of the tonic.""

Fever Tree, established in 2005, now produces a range of soft drinks, and Rolls says the company shipped 30 million bottles in 2011.

These new companies are operating in a tough economic climate, but even more surprising is that some are thriving in a stable-to-declining market for gin, one that is dominated by big brands with marketing clout.

Spiros Malandrakis, drinks analyst at marketing research firm Euromonitor, thinks craft gin could be the next big spirit, even though he notes the overall global gin market posted a 1% decline in total volume sold in 2010.

""While the top-line figures might look sobering at first, if we dig a bit deeper we know that there are segments where we can see optimism and buoyancy,"" he says.

""People are really sick of mainstream mass-produced brands. They want something different, they want something with character.

""They want something to reflect where they're coming from and what their values are,"" he says.

Since Sipsmith opened up the first new copper-pot distillery in London for nearly two centuries - requiring the issuing of a special licence - at least half a dozen more distillers have opened up elsewhere in the capital, some in the most unlikely places.

""I just found out recently that a small distillery will be opening up in my building in Hackney Wick,"" Malandrakis says.

""It's weird... and wonderful.""

The Man in the High Castle: What if the Nazis had won?,"The new show follows a long tradition of alternate-history stories – from the Roman historian Livy to television, where the speculative genre most resonated, writes Keith Uhlich.",['Keith Uhlich'],11/26/2015 0:00,"What if?

That simple question has inspired a great number of artists to imagine scenarios in which the world as we know it is no longer the world as we know it.

It's what made the Roman historian Livy ponder, in his Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Books Of the Founding of the City), what might have happened if Alexander the Great had expanded his empire west instead of east. It gave shape to the plight of the hero in Nathaniel Hawthorne's short story P's Correspondence. who perceives the year 1845 as a time in which long-dead politicians and poets still live.

It's one of the principal motivating queries for It's a Wonderful Life's George Bailey, who is given glimpses of a lifeless world in which he was never born. And it's the theme of Philip K Dick's novel The Man in the High Castle, which imagines a universe in which the Nazis and the Japanese won World War Two and divided the American spoils.

Just put a swastika in place of the stars on the American flag and you’re certain to get chills

A TV adaptation of Dick's book from former X-Files writer Frank Spotnitz premiered in the US on Amazon on 20 November. (The pilot, which aired last year, was one of the highest-rated and viewed in the streaming service's history.) And it certainly goes all-out in depicting a world off its axis. The money shot, which comes early in the first episode, follows square-jawed double-agent Joe Blake (Luke Kleintank) through a Times Square covered in fascist iconography. Just put a swastika in place of both the stars on the US flag and the Coca-Cola neon sign and you’re certain to get chills - and controversy: last week New York mayor Bill de Blasio ordered posters advertising the series to be removed from the city's trains.

The series reworks Dick's spare, suggestive and open-ended novel in a number of intriguing if not always successful ways. And watching all 10 episodes of the series' engrossing, though flawed, first season got me thinking about some of the best ‘What if?’ stories on television. Alternate history stories have found a particularly welcoming home on the small screen.

The mirror crack’d

Look first, unsurprisingly, to the original Twilight Zone, which aired an episode in early 1963 called The Parallel, in which an astronaut in orbit inexplicably finds himself on an alternate Earth. The changes around him are mostly minute (a white picket fence where one never was), with the most epochal variation being that John F Kennedy never became president.

But it's these little differences that drive the protagonist crazy. Humans can't help but crave the familiar, and though the astronaut eventually ends up back on his own Earth, it's with a twist: An alternate-universe version of himself has apparently followed him back.

The Van Dyke beard on the alternate universe variant of Leonard Nimoy's Mr Spock is the episode's scariest conceit

Creepy. And is it any wonder that many other sci-fi-centric shows followed suit with alternate universe stories of their own? Almost all of the Star Trek series made use of the mirror universe plotline from the 1960s show, in which the beloved characters on the Starship Enterprise faced off with their evil counterparts from a parallel reality.

It first appeared in the 1967 episode Mirror, Mirror, in which a transporter malfunction swaps several members of the Enterprise we know with their more sadistic mirror universe doppelgangers. (The Van Dyke beard on the alternate universe variant of Leonard Nimoy's Mr Spock is the episode's scariest conceit.) After things are finally set right, Spock mentions to Captain Kirk (William Shatner) how refreshingly human those doppelgangers seemed, suggesting that our ‘good’ side can be as much of a mask as our ‘evil’ one. Who’s to say the world we know best is necessarily better than any other?

Sometimes alternate realities come in the form of premonitions; characters get a view of how things might be if the world continues on its current course. Among the few lesser-known works by massively influential film-maker Steven Spielberg is his episode of the '70s anthology TV series The Name of the Game, entitled LA 2017.

In it, a book publisher played by Gene Barry blacks out after crashing his car in the Hollywood hills and wakes up to find himself in a desolate world where humans have been driven underground due to pollution. If the environment above ground is toxic, the situation below is much worse, as the surviving populace is at the mercy of a corporatised fascist government.

Like much dystopic fiction, the episode is more about the evanescent fears of the current moment made tactile. Barry's character eventually escapes the nightmare – it's proven to be a literal dream. Yet the image that lingers most is not any of the future visions of anonymous steel structures and a militarised police force, but that of a dead bird lying by the side of the road in the present, an omen of a blasted wasteland that could still be made from humanity's own war on mother earth.

Be careful what you wish for

The Spotnitz-produced X-Files often dipped its toe into alternate universe fiction, one of the best examples of which finds hilarious form in the Season 7 episode Je Souhaite. FBI agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) discovers a wisecracking genie wrapped in a carpet and wishes for ""world peace"". But his good intentions blind him to the literalness of the request. When he steps outside every human being on Earth except for him has vanished, and all the noise pollution with them. Well…it's certainly more peaceful.

Viewers probably didn't expect pathos-ridden alternate universe fiction from an Adult Swim cartoon. But midway through the first season of the often hilariously ribald animated sci-fi series Rick and Morty came the game-changing Rick Potion No 9. Written by series creator Justin Roiland – who also voices both protagonists, alcoholic mad scientist Rick and his awkward teenage grandson Morty – the episode begins like almost any other.

At Morty's irritating insistence, Rick invents a love potion that the high schooler can use on the girl for whom he has a crush. Unfortunately, she has the flu, so the serum quickly spreads like a virus between students, teachers, and the world at large until literally everyone loves Morty.

Rick's attempts to make an antidote result in almost everyone in the population turning into mantis-people (just go with it), which forces the duo to escape to an alternate reality. There, they discover alterna-world versions of themselves who have died in an explosion in Rick's garage. So they bury the bodies in the backyard and resume their lives, though the cognitive dissonance is almost too much for Morty to take.

The horrified look on his face as he walks through this familiar home that isn't truly his is devastating, and it marked the moment when a seemingly silly series proved it could do serious with the best of them. And that’s the thing about alternate-history stories: they’re usually reflections of our own fears, or the fears that inevitably result when our “what if?” daydreams or taken to their logical, and usually unsatisfactory, conclusions.

We start to doubt the concreteness, and even the moral rightness, of our own reality

Perhaps that’s what sets The Man in the High Castle apart. It's outwardly true to Dick's universe, with its rocket ships that jet between Berlin and New York in record time and its vision of the United States as a country both literally and spiritually divided. Yet the demands of an ongoing television series force some necessary changes that tend to take some of the edge off the novel's pointedness.

One of Dick's central motifs is of a book-within-the-book written by the eponymous character. It's called The Grasshopper Lies Heavy, and describes an alternate reality very close to our own where the Allied powers won WWII. It gives the act of reading Dick's book a hall-of-mirrors effect where we start to doubt the concreteness, and even the moral rightness, of our own reality.

In the series, the book within has been changed to a film within. The Grasshopper Lies Heavy is now a series of newsreels – purportedly created by the title character, who never makes an appearance in this first season – that show an alternate reality in which the US triumphs as it should. As the season goes on, it's hinted that the films are actually Rorschach blots of a sort that show each viewer what they want to see. It’s as if, as we’re watching these characters struggle in a world sprung from our own nightmares, they’re looking back at us too.

More over 65s in London 'seek drink problem help',"There has been a sharp rise in the number of people aged over 65 being treated for drinking problems in London, new figures suggest.",[],None,"There has been a sharp rise in the number of people aged over 65 being treated for drinking problems in London, figures suggest.

Figures compiled for BBC Inside Out London by the NHS Information Centre reveal over the past 10 years, there has been a 163% increase in alcohol-related hospital admissions for the over-65s.

The rate is rising faster for the over-65s than any other age group in the UK, and only north-east England has a higher rate of these admissions than London.

Older people are much more likely to drink every day than those of other ages, according to an NHS study into alcohol use.

While the rest of the population is drinking slightly less, and slightly less often on average, this is not the case for older people, it said.

Prof Tony Rao, from the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych), said: ""London is a bit of a pressure point.

""Within London there are areas like Hammersmith and Fulham, Southwark and Camden with even higher rates of death [than the rest of England] from alcohol-related illnesses.""

The RCPsych claims GPs are missing the problems of elderly drinkers through a combination of time constraints, lack of expertise and the reluctance of older people to ask for help.

You don't tend to see a retired 70-year-old bank manager vomiting in the street Dr Claire Gerado, Chair of Royal College of GPs

Dr Claire Gerado, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said: ""I think we focus far too much on the young ones.

""We do that because the young ones are more visible - they vomit in streets. You don't tend to see a retired 70-year-old bank manager vomiting in the street.

""But it's just as much of a problem for people drinking at the other end of life as it is for the young ones.""

NHS research has found older drinkers often regard excessive drinking problems as a taboo subject.

They may also think it is too late to get help, that services are not designed for them, or they may think that they do not have a problem in the first place.

'Never an issue'

Health experts cite a range of reasons for older people drinking heavily including boredom, loneliness, change in lifestyle - usually retirement, bereavement and as a form of self-medication.

But there are very few services which offer specific support for elderly drinkers.

One of the few to target work specifically with older people in London is the charity Foundation 66, which has seen an increasing number of senior citizens seeking help.

I think I just stopped in time, because it was getting to the stage where I was not recovering. I couldn't get off [the] floor Recovering alcoholic

The charity's Sean Dudley said: ""It's interesting that 40% of people who are accessing our service have never accessed an alcohol service previously.

""For them, drinking became problematic probably in their late-40s, their 50s and 60s, whereas previously it was never an issue.""

One Hammersmith resident, who wishes to remain anonymous, is in recovery for a drinking problem that started relatively late in her life.

""I didn't drink hardly at all before the age of 60, just sherry maybe, but then I just took off,"" she said.

""I had lots and lots of upsets with the family, they just couldn't cope and hadn't seen me drinking before - it was out of control, completely out of control.

""I had time on my hands, I met other people who liked a drink and I continued when I went home.

""I think I just stopped in time, because it was getting to the stage where I was not recovering. I couldn't get off [the] floor.""

She is now in recovery for her alcoholism at a centre run by Foundation 66.

Students fight universities' inaction on sexual assault,"Allegations of sexual assault have intensified at Ivy league schools.

Allegations of sexual assault have intensified at Ivy League schools. Now students, schools and the government are trying to fight back.

During commencement week, Harvard tours are top-heavy with proud parents and hopefuls seeking information on admission to this venerated realm of elite education.

Historically it's also a bastion of male dominance. The tour guide chronicles the long battle for gender equality: women were first admitted in 1879, but ""we like to call 1999 the official end of sexism"".

That's when men and women finally got the same diplomas. The university now has a female president and, four years ago for the first time, the graduating class had more women than men.

But if assuming they compare with the national average, one-fifth of them were sexually assaulted in some way while they were students. And this university is one of dozens that has been called to task for how poorly it has handled complaints.

""The trauma imparted by the process was much too close to the trauma caused by the actual assault,"" says former Harvard student Madeleine Smith.

Image caption Madeleine Smith spoke at a White House summit on sexual violence on campus

Rape 'derailed everything'

She filed a rape case against her ex-boyfriend through the university's adjudicatory system. What should have taken two months stretched to seven, during which time he continued to live in her residence building.

""It was terrible,"" she says, ""it derailed everything, my academics were much harder.""

Madeleine told her story at the launch of a White House report on college sexual violence, describing what it was like to sit ""in a room of Harvard professors as they look at a magnified photo of your backside covered in bruises and broken blood-vessels, because those are the personal moments that no-one ever talks about.""

The White House has named 55 colleges and universities under investigation for mishandling sexual assault complaints. Besides Harvard the list also includes other Ivy League institutions such as Princeton and Dartmouth, as well as schools like Florida State and the Pennsylvania State University.

Emily Fox-Penner belongs to a group called Our Harvard Can Do Better. She has filed a formal complaint against the university with the government, citing a law prohibiting gender discrimination at universities known as Title IX.

In 2011, the Obama administration put colleges on notice that Title IX could be used to hold them accountable on sexual assault cases, which triggered a number of lawsuits and helped build a formidable student lobby.

Harvard activists have a long list of demands for reform, but one of the priorities is changing the university's definition of consent, to a clear ""yes.""

At the moment, if a woman doesn't say no or physically resist, the university is less likely to view the incident as rape, says Ms Fox-Penner, especially where alcohol is involved.

""One thing that gets overlooked is that alcohol is often used as a weapon against potential victims on campus,"" she says, ""especially when you're looking at often male-controlled party spaces that are dispensing alcohol to maybe freshmen.""

The following day Ms Fox-Penner and other members of her group are dispensing rolls of red tape. It's the eve of commencement and they're planning a demonstration for the ceremony.

The idea is to get graduating students to put red tape on their caps to show solidarity with rape survivors.

""We're using red tape to show that we are not going to stand for the bureaucracy they present us when we as students want to make Harvard a better place, "" says Pearl, a Harvard senior.

Senate pressure

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Julia Dixon has filed a complaint against her university for the way it handled her sexual assault case.

In fact Harvard is taking action.

The university has hired a Title IX officer and prepared a new policy on sexual assault that is being reviewed by the government. Recently it set up a task force on prevention. This ""will significantly enhance how Harvard responds to incidents of sexual misconduct"", it said in a statement.

The university refused BBC requests for an official interview.

In the meantime, pressure is growing not only from the White House but Capitol Hill, where senators such as Claire McCaskill have begun drafting legislation.

At a recent forum, participants tackled the issue of penalties for student rapists, who are occasionally suspended, very rarely expelled.

""I know the vast majority of these perpetrators aren't even getting a criminal interview,"" Ms McCaskill said, as she heard that rape survivors still don't feel safe, even though they are filing cases and speaking out. ""We aren't going to get any meaningful deterrent on this problem until that begins happening.""

A graphic reminder of the problem jolted Harvard in March when the campus newspaper published a letter from an assault victim, nearly a year after the university initiated its reforms.

Entitled Dear Harvard: You Win, the anonymous woman graphically described her trauma at failing to get her assailant removed from their shared residence, and said Harvard's ""out-dated and narrow"" policy discouraged her from even filing a case.

""Dear Harvard, I am writing to let you know that I give up. I will be moving out of my House next semester, if only - quite literally - to save my life.""

Gun concerns: Why doctors should not always speak out,"In this week's Scrubbing Up, Dr Michael Devlin, head of advisory services at the Medical Defence Union, explains that GPs are struggling to decide when and if to break patient confidentiality over gun licences.","['Viewpoint', 'Dr Michael Devlin', 'Head Of Advisory Services', 'Medical Defence Union']",None,"Image caption There have been calls for gun control laws to be tightened

As calls are made for tighter gun licence controls in the wake of Derrick Bird's rampage in Cumbria, during which 12 people died, doctors' leaders have been in talks about when to raise concerns over the mental health of patients.

In this week's Scrubbing Up, Dr Michael Devlin says the public may expect a doctor to always speak out but warns there is a risk a patient could feel his confidentiality had been breached and not seek the treatment they need.

It is commonly accepted that it is more difficult to obtain a certificate for a shotgun or firearm in the UK than many other countries.

However, the application process and the monitoring of existing certificate-holders have come under scrutiny in the wake of the Cumbrian tragedy, although there was no indication that Bird was mentally ill.

And there have been calls for gun control laws to be tightened.

Home Secretary Theresa May has said that ""it would be wrong to react before we know the full facts"".

But if, as has been suggested, GPs are given a greater role, it is important that their responsibilities are made clear and that appropriate guidance and advice is available to them.

Problems can arise for the GP if the patient develops a new illness (such as becoming addicted to drugs or alcohol or developing a psychosis) after a certificate has been granted or renewed Dr Michael Devlin Read your comments

Individual police forces have a statutory obligation to deal with applications for firearms or shotgun certificates from individuals living in their area - but they may need the professional opinion of the local GP on the mental state of the applicant, which can create a confidentiality dilemma.

Prospective gun owners are asked to give their written consent to this disclosure and provide details of their GP when completing the application form.

But problems can arise for the GP if the patient develops a new illness (such as becoming addicted to drugs or alcohol or developing a mental health problem) after a certificate has been granted or renewed.

This can create an ethical dilemma and more information or guidance is needed to help the GP come to the right decision.

Doctor-patient relationship

The Medical Defence Union receives on average at least one call a month from doctors seeking advice about the confidentiality of patients who wish to own a gun, hold a shotgun or firearms certificate or who may have access to them.

The most common queries relate to what patient information they can disclose to the police and whether the confidentiality of patients can be breached if a patient with access to a gun gives cause for concern.

In going to the police, the GP could arguably have destroyed the patient's faith in him and may have deterred the man from getting treatment for his condition Dr Michael Devlin

Most people will expect GPs to raise concerns about a patient with access to guns or co-operate with the police if they ask for medical information about a gun owner but it is not always straightforward.

The difficulty is that they have a duty of patient confidentiality which is central to the success of the doctor-patient relationship and means that patients feel able to confide honestly with their GP.

For example, one might see a patient being treated for depression expressing angry resentment towards his ex-wife following an acrimonious divorce and threatening to ""wipe the smile from her face"". At the end of a consultation he may say he is going pheasant shooting that weekend and had owned a shotgun for several years.

Would the GP be justified in breaching patient confidentiality and reporting his threats to the police in these circumstances?

It may be that in doing so the GP could prevent a crime but equally the patient may have felt that the GP's surgery was a safe place in which he could express his frustrations and would never have acted upon his threats.

In going to the police, the GP could arguably have destroyed the patient's faith in him and may have deterred the man from getting treatment for his condition.

The General Medical Council says doctors can disclose patient information without their permission where necessary ""to protect individuals or society from risk of serious harm such as... serious crime"".

The GMC's guidance continues to explain that doctors should usually seek the patient's consent or tell the patient they are going to disclose information without their consent, unless to do so would put others at risk or would undermine the prevention or detection of a serious crime.

Any new government guidance for GPs could further assist doctors in making such difficult decisions.","['concerns', 'gp', 'patients', 'shotgun', 'gps', 'guidance', 'doctors', 'confidentiality', 'information', 'gun', 'speak', 'patient']","Prospective gun owners are asked to give their written consent to this disclosure and provide details of their GP when completing the application form.

Hamzah Khan: Children's Minister highlights 'glaring absences',"The children's minister highlights 10 ""glaring absences"" from the serious case review into the death of Hamzah Khan.",[],None,"Image caption Hamzah Khan was deprived of food and drink over a period of years by his alcoholic mother

A report into the death of four-year-old Hamzah Khan has been strongly criticised by Children's Minister Edward Timpson.

He highlighted 10 ""glaring absences"" from the serious case review carried out after Hamzah's death.

In a letter to Prof Nick Frost, the independent chairman of the Bradford Safeguarding Children Board, he said he had ""deep concerns"" over the review.

Below is an abridged version of the 10 points raised in Mr Timpson's letter.

'Domestic violence'

December 2006

One of Hamzah Khan's siblings spoke to the police about domestic violence at home and the police referred him to children's social care. The child returned home.

Was the child assessed? If not, why not?

'Foster carers'

March 2007

One of Hamzah Khan's siblings was remanded by magistrates and placed with foster carers for two nights, then returned home.

Was the child assessed by children's social care? If not, why not?

'Running away from father'

Image caption Hamzah Khan's father Aftab said he was ""pushed to one side"" by the police and social services

May 2007

The child who appeared before magistrates was injured while running away from his father.

While in hospital he requested help to live away from his family and was referred to children's social care.

He was given emergency accommodation but returned home by the end of May.

The review says that a statutory assessment could have been expected at this point. Was the child assessed? If not, why not?

'Under the influence of an unknown substance'

April 2009

Three of the Khan children were not collected from primary school.

Following a welfare visit, police reported to children's social care that there were insufficient beds for at least one of the children in the house and the mother appeared to be under the influence of an unknown substance.

The serious case review says that a statutory assessment could have been expected at this point.

Why was no assessment undertaken?

'Difficulties seeing the children'

Late 2010

Image caption During Hutton's trial, the court heard of the ""breathtakingly awful"" conditions she lived in

The review refers to ""correspondence"" between health visitors, education, early childhood services and children's social care ""which centred on the difficulties in seeing the children"".

This was followed by reports (it is unclear from whom) that some of the children were living outside Bradford.

What action did children's social care take at this point?

'Physically neglected'

January 2011

The school attended by one of Hamzah Khan's siblings in Year 8 reported to children's social care that attendance had fallen to 51% and apparently (it is not clear from the serious case review) reported that the child appeared physically neglected.

Children's social care decided this was a school attendance issue and declined to assess. Why?

'Anonymous referral'

March 2011

An anonymous report was made to police of shouting and swearing at children.

Why did children's social care rely on the education social network report that concerns did not appear substantiated as the younger children had been ""placed in Portsmouth"". Why did they undertake no further inquiries of their own?

'Invisible'

Mr Timpson states that the serious case review alludes to ""the extent to which Hamzah was unknown and invisible to services throughout his short life"".

The review makes clear that local agencies had concerns about the poor attendance of some of Hamzah's siblings.

What actions were taken, and when, to establish the causes of this?

What, if any, consideration was given to the possibility of neglectful parenting being a factor in low attendance?

'Not registered with a GP'

The review refers to attempts ""to establish the whereabouts of the three youngest children after the health visitor initially identified that Hamzah was not registered with a GP"".

What form did these attempts take? Given that the children did not appear to have left Bradford, what prevented the children's whereabouts being established quickly?

Visits to children's home

The serious case review refers to children's social care making a number of visits to the children's home.

What were the outcomes of these visits,? Did conversations take place with the children and was there any follow up?

If no action was taken, why not?","['khan', 'highlights', 'glaring', 'absences', 'hamzah', 'childrens', 'care', 'social', 'minister', 'review', 'children', 'case', 'child', 'khans', 'serious']","He highlighted 10 ""glaring absences"" from the serious case review carried out after Hamzah's death.

Ex-England goalkeeper Peter Shilton admits drink-drive charge,Former England goalkeeper Peter Shilton is banned for 20 months after admitting drinking and driving in Essex.,[],None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Peter Shilton: ""I had a very fair hearing""

England's most capped footballer Peter Shilton has been banned from driving for 20 months after pleading guilty to a drink-driving offence.

The 63-year-old, of Kenilworth in Warwickshire, was arrested in Manor Road in Colchester on 24 February.

Shilton, whose partner is understood to live in Colchester, was charged with driving with excess alcohol.

Magistrates in Colchester also ordered him to pay fines and costs totalling £1,020.

Peter Shilton England's most-capped footballer, playing 125 games

Ever-present in the 1982, 1986 and 1990 World Cups

Played for Leicester City in the 1969 FA Cup final

Won league title in 1978 and the 1979 and 1980 European Cups with Nottingham Forest

Played 1,000th league game in 1996, with Leyton Orient

Retired from playing aged 47

Took part in Strictly Come Dancing in 2010

During his 30-year football career Shilton played more than than 1,000 competitive matches for 11 different clubs including Leicester, Stoke, Nottingham Forest, Southampton and Derby.

He played 125 times for England, including every match at three consecutive World Cups - in 1982, 1986 and 1990.

'Deep regret'

The 15-minute court hearing was told Shilton had more than double the legal amount of alcohol in his system when he was breathalysed by police.

He had been drinking wine at a family celebration during the day but did not think he was over the limit, the court heard.

He was driving a 2010-registered Jaguar XF near the home of his girlfriend, Stephanie Hayward, and was caught after an anonymous tip-off to police.

Paul Tawn, mitigating, said Shilton would find it difficult to pay any fine because his finances were ""complicated"" because he was going through a divorce and selling his house.

He added: ""He had gone to move his car closer to his partner's address because he had an early start.

""He didn't travel far, just a couple of streets, and wasn't driving very quickly at all.""

Mr Tawn described the arrest as a ""matter of deep regret"" for Shilton, who had three points on his licence following a speeding offence in March 2011.

As he left court, Shilton said: ""I've nothing to say, really - just that I had a very fair hearing.""

Mike, Ashford

It seems to me that there are two real problems which need tackling at the root cause: 1- Like all walks of life, we are being bound tighter and tighter by red tape. Do you support my view that we need to take a few steps back, let common sense prevail and get back to doing the job rather than supplying endless facts in case they may be needed one day? If so, how will you help to do this? 2 - Many parents seem to take the view that the police and teachers are there to relieve them of their own parental responsibilities. Do you believe that they need educating to remind them of their correct role, to bring their children up as decent citizens, not leave it to others and realise that they are responsible for their childrens' misdemeanours?

Tue Jan 20 05:41:07 2004 Adrian Russell, Chatham,Kent

The lack of resources is causing a downward spiral. The lawless know they are more likely to get away with it, and therefore break the law with impunity. It is the fear of getting caught that prevents crime. The powers that be can quote clear up figures all they like. There must be a tendency to only bother if you know it will be a plus in the clear up figures. At least this is the impression the ordinary people are getting. Figures prove nothing to us. We are there and see what is really happening.Until we SEE change, we will not be impressed. I sincerely hope you do make a difference - to the people, not the pen pushers.

Mon Jan 12 20:00:01 2004 Retired Police Officer Dover

Intelligence based policying in Kent has been tried on a number of times through out the last 30 years and each time has given way to public pressure to see more officers on the beat. Chief Constable, your current police model requires beat officers to be taken off their traditional street duties where they can be seen to be preventing and detecting crime, You have not got the establishment to successfully carry out both intelligence based and traditional policing in Kent.To regain public confidence in your police service you must comply with the wishes of the people you serve. Chief Constable Barry Paine had the right idea. In his day the morale of your police officers was high and the public received a very high standard of policing in Kent. Mr Ayling is, or should be aware of Mr Paine's successful policing methodes. Your comments please.

A popular topic it would seem; I live in the Marlowe Park area of Strood, which is in the grip of teenage gangs it would seem. Our bus shelters are constantly vandalised, as our telephone boxes and cars. The brick walls in our area are kicked down and the bricks used for further vandalism. On top of this the residents of this area are feel too intimidated by these 'children' to walk their dogs or use the local shops after dark. This is unacceptable and anti-social behaviour and furthermore unfair to the residents who just want to live in peace. What can we do? What can you do?

The police service is funded by the community and yet for many years has become more and more remote from the community it serves and dismissive of local needs.

Will our new chief constable consider reinstating the resident village policeman? We had a police officer living in our village until a few years ago, but when he retired he was not replaced, the police house was sold and now all we have is a community policeman/woman's answering machine to report minor crime to, which is not followed up until days later,thus negating any chance of apprehension of offenders (usually kids) and/or dishing out a few words of warning, which can often nip in the bud any further bad behaviour, and prevent young people from going onto more serious crime in the future.

We have had bricks thrown at our kitchen window and even had our front door kicked in by them but the police seem powerless to do anything about it. Instead they look at the easy option and say that there is nothing they can do about it. It is making our lives a misery and we cannot even let our children out in the back garden to play because the last time they went out they had eggs thrown at them and they are only 5,7 and 9 years old. what do you propose to do about the problems in the area because it can be a nice place to live but the minority make it a troublespot for the majority.

Margate (my home town) has a lot of annoying and usually petty crime...Cars being broken into, shoplifting and burglary etc. It is my opinion that the Government and the police's attitude to going soft on the drug problem is fueling this sort of behavior. In other words these people have to get the money for drugs from somewhere and they resort to crime to feed their habit. Would it not be more sensible to take a hard line with these people?

As the largest force area in the Country without helicopter support, what plans do you have to establish an Air Operations Unit in line with Home Office policy? Support from surrounding forces cannot be guaranteed if their aircrft are in use, and the nearest unit is 15 minutes flying time even just to get to the Kent border. If Sussex, Surrey, the Met and Essex all regard Air Support as a necessity, surely Kent cannot afford to dismiss such a project. I understand that Home Office funding is available to help offset the capital investment in a helicopter, and the revenue cost is affordable even to a force as small as Surrey (new unit opening April 2004).

My question is (rephrased)- will you look into how the probation service is working - particulary in regards to drug related offences, especially if these are combined with behavioural/mental health issues. Could young offenders and young adults on probation - be taken to prisons and to hospices to see where the road can end ? How about random drugs testing while they are on probation ? It seem that offenders on probation can refuse to engage with substances misuse workers, can anything be done about this ? My experience is that probation as it is now - for young adults with drug addiction - is not doing enough - to help reeducate a way of thinking or as a deterrant. Would it be possible to look into a reform of how the probation service works ?

The probation service does not seem to be working - youths/young adults have no respect for it. It only does the absolute basic that is needed. I am thinking in particular about young adults on probation for drug charges with possible behavoural/mental health issues as a result of the drugs. Will you look into reviwing the way probation is carried out for yound adults. I believe the way probation is implemented needs to be overhauled.

The main road through the centre of Tunbridge Wells, between the Opera House and the Post Office, is restricted to buses and taxis on weekdays from 10 am to 4 pm. But the restriction is never enforced and hundreds of cars and vans use this road each day. Even when Police Officers are in the area (very infrequently) they take no action to enforce the law. This seriously undermines respect for road traffic law generally as well as irritating law abiding motorists. When is Mr Fuller going to take action on this problem?

A close frient was involved in a serious accident at Matfield on New Years eve, despite being caused by dangerous driving by an inexperienced driver, the Police will not prosecute, but do not hesitate in cases of 3mph over the limit, is the paperwork too much bother?

Chief Constable - Welcome, I am the Retired Special Divisional Commandant of 'C' & 'D Divisions. In my day Kent had over 700 Specials. This number has now halved. What are you prposing to do to recruit more Specials and what is YOUR attitude to these Volunteers ?

Making policing more accountable locally may be a commendable objective, but is the Kent force adequately resourced with funds and suitably skilled personnel to tackle investigation of foreign corruption, fraud, money laundering and other economic crime?

Do you envisage uplifting & opening-up the local (ie. ward members & community groups) means of communication with the force? In my judgement this has deteriorated over the past 5 years and leads to increased misunderstanding of aims & objectives etc. Good luck in your new appointment!

Mon Jan 5 13:43:28 2004 Alan Witt,Charing

I would like to know what the police or the public can do in order to force the judiciary to be more stringent in the enforcement of our apparently feeble laws. How are the Police supposed to keep law and order whislt the system, including many magistrates, give the impression that the police service is not given given support and the public is not protected? The European Convention on Human Rights is often cited as an excuse to prevent police and magistrates doing their job as they would wish.Also European Law now has supremecy over English and Scottish Law. Would Mr Fuller consider the possibility of urging whatever Government is in power, to obtain some exemptions so that we can, once again, make our own laws? neighbours?

Not really a question - first to say it is great that Kent has a coloured Commissioner, though many more counties with a higher ratio of coloured would have been expected to have done so. My question: Are you able to command respect from your your own Force, if yes. Why!!

Mon Jan 5 12:24:40 2004 Stanley from Ashford

I belive that the lack of Police responce to antisocial behaviour throughout Kent causes people to have a greater fear of other types of crime. What do you intend Kent Police to do about antisocial behaviour? Also do you feel that the Antisocial behaviour laws deter Police Officers from tackling this problem as in can be time consuming

Having friends in the Police service in Kent, I have often moan about the fact there is not enough police vehicles to allow them to patrol the streets in. I recently heard that a Kent Police area got rid of 8 Police vehicles and have not replaced them. This is unacceptable. We can not have an efficient Police Service unless there is the equipment for officers to use

I am encouraged that the first black Chief Police Officer will be heading the Kent Police Force and that he has outstanding credentials for the job. However, I am also appalled by the perceived malpractice of your officers and believe that I am being kind to them by using the word perceived. The crimes perpetrated against my mother at her home are an affront to our family and all law abiding citizens living in the local community. Furthermore, I would say that the Kent Police Force have handed the detection of crime over to the people who are paying your officers their wages in the form of taxation. Does the Kent police also envisage handing over the punishing of criminals to the public? The Kent Constabulary are very boastful of their record in crime detection but this ability to detect is almost impossible to observe from the layman’s perspective. In fact, it is my humble opinion that many crimes are not detected and that these non-detections are subsequently not recorded as such. We are told to install CCTV, get witnesses, keep a log etc.. etc.,, Explain to us, then, why we need millions of pounds of investment in state of the art facilities and technology for your force headquarters? If we, the public, do detect the criminals, which seems to be the only way to proceed, your officers then seem intent on hindering the process of bringing them to justice. The sort of tactic I am referring to is where the criminal is allowed to make a counter allegation and then some form of bargaining takes place whereby your officers are able to process the crime in a way satisfactory to them and not to the benefit of the victim. In our experience the victim has then to endure further and more aggressive persecution by the original criminal and other miscreants that he has recruited. The allegations that I am making against officers of your force are serious. I contend that your officers have • Not been recording the crimes that we have been informing them of • Not classifying the crimes properly • Made victims feel like the criminals • Allowed the perpetrators to continue practising their crimes undeterred • Created a situation whereby the law abiding citizens have to kowtow to the seemingly untouchable criminal elements who loiter outside their homes. I have now written several letters and emails to you but the ongoing criminal abuse of my elderly widowed mother remains unresolved. The most recent incident has resulted in the breaking of my mother’s exterior lighting, the smashing of her dining room window and the vandalism of my sister’s car. This was all unprovoked and at 3’oclock in the morning. But what is the point of telling you that, I’ve written to your force before about similar incidents and not received satisfactory responses. I said in a letter to the previous Chief Constable, almost one year ago, that if we did not have justice then I would be forced to go to the press instead. Maybe that is where you will read this.

The following is my response to the Home Office discussion document 'Policing: Building Safer Communities Together' Much of my comment was obviously as a result of my experiences and contacts with Kent Police. Policy Document ‘Policing: Building Safer Communities Together’ A Response Foreword 1st Paragraph: ‘As a government we are working to build safer communities etc’ Comment: It is difficult to see how since for years the government has resolutely refused to listen to what the customer (the public) wants. They will not start to build safer communities until they consult properly and act upon what the customer wants. The customer wants more Community Police Officers who have smaller areas and who are allowed to spend the majority of their time on their beat. Our Community Police Officer spent just two days on his beat in October because he was directed to ‘other duties’. The Police Service should be far more accountable to the local community and less driven by unrealistic, targeted demands from the Home Office, which is too distant and out of touch with local needs. 3rd Paragraph: ‘Police numbers are historically high, and the chance of being a victim of crime is historically low’. Comment: If the numbers are so high, where are the police officers? Not on the streets, that’s for sure, despite there being record numbers of civilians in back office jobs. If the chance of being a victim of crime is historically low, how is it that I and one of my neighbours have been victims of vandalism this week? 4th Paragraph: ‘Our reforms must be driven by our broader objectives: We want a police service which is efficient, effective and value for money: which rewards the skills of its personnel’. Comment: I can’t believe the Home Secretary actually wrote, let alone believes this stuff. The broader objective must be GREATER CUSTOMER SATISFACTION! When will the Home Office ever learn? 5th Paragraph: ‘We understand that public services, including the police …..can only be successful if they are conducted with people’. Comment: Well whoopee! This paragraph reflects the Home Office’s true priorities. This is the most important paragraph, It should have been the first and not relegated two thirds of the way down the page, almost as an afterthought. Section 4 Paragraph 4.5 ‘This might be through local people, having reliable data, questioning their local police leaders in community meetings about performance’. Comment: The following letter was drafted recently, but not sent, following an account in our local paper of just such a meeting between concerned citizens and police officers. The police officers present were led by the Chief Constable of Kent and the Deputy Chief Constable. “I am appalled at the complacency displayed by some of the most senior police officers in the county at the meeting with members of the public at Goudhurst on Thursday 20th November. (See report by Emma Lunn in Kent and Sussex Courier, Tunbridge Wells edition 28/11/03). Some of the comments attributed to these officers make one despair. This one from the Acting Chief Constable, Robert Ayling, “A thousand of our front line officers are in their first year of service and so do not know their patch very well”. This extraordinary comment has three worrying implications, which the police appear to accept as normal.  Kent Police has a very high rate of turnover.  Police officers receive little or no initial training about the geography of Kent,  Police officers have to be in the job for more than year before they can be expected to know their way around! This is an unacceptable situation by any standards. A thousand Kent police officers represents a substantial percentage of the total force. What do they teach them during their 15 weeks training? Surely it should be part of every police officer’s core knowledge to have a very good idea of the geography of his own county, with emphasis on the area he/she will ultimately be working in. Mr Ayl

Fri Jan 2 17:46:17 2004 Trevor Sidley, Teston

Question for the New Chief Constable of Kent From the Home Office document “Crime in England and Wales 2002/2003” and “Kent Police Authority Annual Report 2002/2003” Recorded Crime in Kent has increased yet again, but the detection rate has fallen for the fourth year in a row; it’s now 27.9% from 28.2%, and 33% and 34% before that. The cost of Kent Policing continues to rise, with the cost borne by the consumer through Council Tax, again exceeding inflation. Despite this Kent Police have failed to achieve the majority of their own “Policing Objectives” for 2002/2003, particularly those with regard to fear of crime. In terms of Customer Satisfaction the “Best Value Performance Indicators” continue to get worse. It cannot be logical to continue to do what’s been done in the past and expect a different result. By these measurements any Kent Resident might reasonably ask what you are going to do to differently to make Kent feel a better and safer community and why should your proposals succeed when clearly past Chief Constables have presided over a continuing worsening situation...

Serial killer trial priest 'raped schoolgirl 40 times',,"['Lucy Adams', 'Bbc Scotland Correspondent']",2018-06-14 23:13:07+00:00,"Image caption Father Gerry Nugent was the priest at the church where Angelika Kluk's body was found

A disgraced Roman Catholic priest has been accused of raping a schoolgirl up to 40 times over a two-year period.

Father Gerry Nugent was shamed in 2007 when he admitted to a murder trial he had sex with student Angelika Kluk, a victim of serial killer Peter Tobin.

Police Scotland have now confirmed they are investigating historical allegations of child sexual abuse against the priest, who died in 2010.

The Catholic Church said it was ""truly sorry"" for what happened decades ago.

The church said it now had a ""dramatically different awareness of child protection issues"".

It said Fr Nugent was ""removed from parish ministry"" as soon as the extent of his inappropriate sexual behaviour with adults became apparent in 2007 and that ""allegations relating to minors only emerged after his removal"".

Image caption Angelika Kluk was murdered in September 2006

The BBC has spoken to a 51-year-old woman, who we are calling Teresa, who said that Fr Nugent raped her repeatedly when she was 13.

She is seeking damages from the Catholic Church.

Teresa said Fr Nugent had been close to her grandmother, with whom she lived in the west end of Glasgow.

She said: ""He was a very dear friend to gran and because I loved her so much and I could see their relationship made her happy I always felt happy, confident, comfortable in his presence.""

But she went on to describe a sinister pattern of behaviour by Fr Nugent which progressed from holding her hand to stroking her.

Teresa added: ""Eventually, around the time of my 13th birthday, he raped me and continued to do so for two years on a regular basis.

""I loved him very much so I thought that this behaviour was normal in families because that is what he told me.""

Teresa claimed Fr Nugent, who was often under the influence of alcohol, first raped her in the flat where she lived with her grandmother.

She also claimed he would sexually assault her in the stairwell of the building.

Teresa said: ""It happened in an motorway underpass on a couple of occasions and quite often it would happen when we were just walking down the street.

""He never seemed at all concerned that a priest would be a walking down the road while having his hand on the bottom of an obviously very young girl.""

Image caption Fr Nugent was a priest at St Patrick's Church in Anderston, Glasgow

Asked how many times it happened, Teresa replied: ""Actual rape?

""I think somewhere in the region of 30 and 40 times in total.""

The mother-of-four claims the abuse stopped when she was 15 after her grandmother died from a massive brain haemorrhage.

Around this time she discovered she was not Fr Nugent's only alleged victim.

After Teresa confided in a friend, she told her: ""I know. This is what he has been doing to me.""

These allegations are also being investigated by Police Scotland.

Both women are being represented by Thompsons Solicitors.

A Glasgow law firm is also thought to be speaking to a third victim.

Public apology

Teresa has suffered anxiety and depression throughout her adult life and has undergone therapy.

Her relationship with her husband also broke down.

She said: ""There hasn't been a single aspect of my life that it hasn't affected and I haven't always been conscious of that.""

In 2015 she approached the Catholic Church about her experiences.

Theresa said she met safeguarding staff at the Archdiocese of Glasgow and Archbishop Philip Tartaglia, whom she thanked for his public apology.

But she claimed ""the shutters came down"" after she threatened legal action.

Theresa believes there are more alleged victims of Fr Nugent and urged them to come forward.

She added: ""These acts are historical but the effects are not historical.

""They are affecting people every single day.""

Image caption Peter Tobin, the man who murdered Angelika Kluk, was later unmasked as a serial killer

Fr Nugent hit the headlines in September 2006 after the mutilated body of 23-year-old Angelika Kluk was found under the floorboards of St Patrick's Church in the Anderston area of Glasgow.

Serial killer Peter Tobin had been working there as a church handyman, under an assumed name.

Tobin was eventually convicted of the murder, but during the trial Fr Nugent admitted he was in a sexual relationship with Angelika.

The Dublin-born priest, who was forced to resign from his post, said he felt ""shame"" and ""disgust"" with himself and admitted he had abused the position of trust he was in.

The self-confessed alcoholic was also found guilty of contempt of court because he did not give straight answers in the witness box during the trial.

At the time, the Catholic Church issued an apology over the priest's behaviour.

He died in January 2010, aged 66, after a suspected heart attack.

'Sincere and heartfelt'

Last year a long-standing time bar which prevented victims of childhood abuse seeking civil legal action was lifted.

The Catholic Church confirmed it is aware of complaints against Fr Nugent dating back to the 1970s.

A church spokesman said: ""Allegations have been made by women that they were sexually assaulted by the late Fr Gerry Nugent when they were children, some around 40 years ago.

""The crimes described in these allegations are appalling.

""The Church, its bishops, priests and people are truly sorry for what has happened.

""The Archbishop has met the survivor interviewed by the BBC and apologised in person and on behalf of the Church for what she has gone through.

""That apology is sincere and heartfelt and is extended to anyone who suffered at the hands of Fr Nugent or any other representative of the Church.""

Appeal for 'victims'

The church confirmed no allegations of child abuse until after Fr Nugent was removed from his ministry.

In 1995 he was sent for ""psychological assessment"" and therapy following an anonymous allegation he engaged in ""inappropriate sexual conduct with an adult"".

But the spokesman added: ""The assessment did not flag any issues with his sexual conduct, but highlighted alcohol abuse as a cause for concern.

""It may be that no-one will ever know the full truth of all Fr Nugent's wrongful conduct and criminal actions, but the Church remains ready and willing to co-operate with the police and statutory authorities to assist survivors.

""The Church offers ongoing counselling to those affected and will also co-operate fully should they engage legal representation to seek financial recompense.""

Teresa's lawyer Alan Rodgers said: ""What we really want to do is take her case forward and give other people the inspiration and courage to come forward if they have been through similar experiences so that we can also try to obtain answers for them.""

Drug users in Scotland 'consume most cocaine' in one session,"A survey finds Scots use more of the drug per session - and in Glasgow can order it ""quicker than pizza'"".",[],None,"Image copyright Getty Images

Drug users in Scotland consume the most cocaine in a single session, according to a worldwide survey of drug-taking habits.

The 2018 Global Drug Survey looked at the recreational drug use of 130,000 people across 44 countries.

In Scotland the amount of the drug consumed per session was more than double the global average.

Researchers, who quizzed 15,000 cocaine users, said the drug can be delivered ""more quickly than a pizza"" in Glasgow.

The survey, which is self-selecting and conducted anonymously, found 36.7% of users in the city reported delivery of the drug ""within 30 minutes"".

For users in England that figure rises slightly to 36.8% - placing them fifth in the world rankings.

Scots were found on average to consume 1.2g of cocaine in a single session, signifcantly higher than both the figure in England (0.7g) and the worldwide average (0.5g).

Some drugs experts have suggested cocaine in Scotland might be less pure.

Image copyright PA Image caption Scotland also fared badly in the survey when it came to problem drinking

The survey also looked at alcohol use, and found Scotland had the highest proportion of respondents (4.2%) who sought emergency medical care after a drinking session.

The report said: ""This is double the level of English drinkers seeking medical treatment after drinking (2.1%), highlighting how entrenched a problem drinking is north of the border.""

Prof Adam Winstock, consultant psychiatrist and addiction medicine specialist, and founder of the survey, said: ""The 2018 Global Drug Survey highlights how much more work there is to do with alcohol messaging in the UK.

""It is clear that the link between alcohol consumption and increased cancer risk is a message that is still not reaching UK drinkers and where it does, many chose to react to the message with scepticism.

He said the regularity of people ending up in accident and emergency departments was ""truly alarming"".

Prof Winstock added: ""That both England and Scotland are in the top five global nations needing emergency treatment after alcohol consumption is truly concerning.

""This is another finding that shows how much more work is required to drive home the message of responsible drinking.""

Bulking agents

Katy MacLeod of Scottish Drugs Forum said the true weight of a drug sold as a ""gram"" can vary and seems to be lower in Scotland than elsewhere.

She said: ""The low purity of cocaine supplied in Scotland suggests that bulking agents have been used to dilute the drug and so the same weight in Scotland will have less cocaine than in other countries.

""Using with alcohol may mean that people are using cocaine to allow them to keep drinking alcohol and so it is alcohol that is driving this behaviour.

""Mixing alcohol with other drugs adds to the potential for harm to users and others.""","['alcohol', 'survey', 'global', 'message', 'drug', 'users', 'consume', 'cocaine', 'drinking', 'session', 'scotland']","Image copyright Getty ImagesDrug users in Scotland consume the most cocaine in a single session, according to a worldwide survey of drug-taking habits.

The English We Speak / Cyberbullying,Is there someone tormenting you online? Here's an expression for when people hide behind a computer to attack others.,[],None,"Summary

Rob and Feifei talk about an expression from this age of digital communication. It describes negative behaviour using electronic devices. Find out more in the programme.

Transcript

Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.

Rob

Hello and welcome to The English We Speak with me Rob…

Feifei

…and me Feifei. Hello.

Rob

In this programme, we're talking about an expression that's appeared in the age of the internet. And it's connected to social media. So Feifei do you communicate with other people a lot on social media?

Feifei

Yes, I do. I love chatting with my friends and meeting new people… some people are mean though. They write very negative messages attacking others… it's nasty!

Rob

It is. And it's something we call cyberbullying. That's a form of bullying in which people harass and harm other people online deliberately. And unlike the traditional bully, the electronic bully can remain anonymous. So we don't know who they are.

Feifei

Cyberbullying includes things like spreading lies and rumours online, sending or forwarding unpleasant messages via instant messaging, text or on social networks.

Rob

Yes. It's becoming very common among teenagers these days. There are campaigns against cyberbullying and some places have adopted laws to prevent it. Let's hear examples of how this expression is used.

Examples

Kate is a victim of cyberbullying. It's so bad she doesn't want to leave the house. Someone from school has put messages on social media saying she's ugly and she should die. It's terrible!

Experts say people should protect themselves from cyberbullying by not taking everything to heart.

Feifei

Well, this last example includes some good advice.

Rob

Indeed. Experts advise you not to give out your own or friends' personal information and know how to block or report people who behave in an improper way.

Feifei

And when you send messages to people, be careful about what you write and post online. And don't share an unkind personal comment or image. Remember that though you think you have just a computer in front of you, on the other side of the screen there is a real human being.

Rob

So be safe and happy online. Enjoy social media.

Mississippi Burning case: KKK killer Edgar Ray Killen dies,"Edgar Ray Killen, 92, was only jailed in 2005, 41 years after he helped organise a triple murder.",[],None,"Image copyright Marianne Todd Image caption Killen was sent to prison in 2005 for his role in the triple murder

Edgar Ray Killen, the 1960s Ku Klux Klan leader who was convicted over the infamous deaths of three civil rights workers in Mississippi, has died.

The 92-year-old was serving a 60-year sentence, after being jailed in 2005, four decades after the 1964 murders.

The men's disappearance and deaths shocked the country and helped catalyse the passage of the Civil Rights Act.

The triple killing was also the basis for the 1988 Oscar-winning film Mississippi Burning.

The movie is a fictionalised take on the events named after the FBI investigation into the case.

James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, all in their 20s, were members of the Congress of Racial Equality (Core) and had been working on the 1964 Freedom Summer campaign to register black voters in the southern state.

The men were detained by police before being ambushed and shot by Klansmen who were tipped off about their release.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Two of the men had travelled to Mississippi from New York for the project

The trio went missing after being arrested by local police on a traffic charge while in Neshoba County, Mississippi. They had been visiting the scene of a fire-bombing and beating at a local church that was going to be used as a Freedom School to educate and help register local African-Americans.

Image copyright FBI/State of Mississippi Attorney General's Office Image caption Killen pictured in June 1964

After being released from prison in the night, the men were again stopped and then ambushed by KKK members.

After the case garnered national attention, the FBI was dispatched to the state to investigate by then Attorney General Robert Kennedy.

The three men's bodies were eventually uncovered six weeks after their disappearance, after an informant tipped off the FBI that they had been buried on local farmland.

The FBI arrested more than a dozen suspects, including the county's Deputy Sheriff, because of their alleged involvement in the killings.

A Mississippi judge attempted to dismiss the charges against most of the defendants, but the Supreme Court later reversed the decision.

After federal intervention, 18 men went on trial in 1967 on civil rights violation charges. Only seven were convicted by an all-white jury, and none served more than seven years in prison.

Killen, a former Baptist preacher, was accused of orchestrating the killings, but his trial ended in a hung jury after a juror said she could not convict a preacher.

The state did not pursue the case for four decades, but eventually Killen was brought to face a new trial in 2005.

Prosecutors said as a ""kleagle"" or KKK organiser, he had assembled the murderous mob and instructed them how to dispose of the bodies, but was not at the murder scene itself.

He was convicted of three charges of manslaughter for recruitment and orchestration.

Even after his imprisonment, Killen was said to maintain segregationist views about racial inequality.

A cyber attack on the French television network TV5 Monde may have been carried out by Russian-based hackers, police believe.

Jihadist propaganda was posted on the station's website in April by individuals claiming to represent Islamic State.

A police investigation is now focussing on a group of Russian hackers called APT28, according to French media.

The group has tried to hack the White House in the past, L'Express reports.

It has also targeted the computer systems of Nato members, Russian dissidents and Ukrainian activists, according to the newspaper.

A judicial source told AFP that investigators were narrowing the search by probing the IP addresses of computers used in the attack.

TV5 Monde was forced to broadcast pre-recorded programmes after the hack, which it described as ""unprecedented in the history of television"".

A message warning French troops to stay away from Islamic State was published on the station's Facebook page.

The hackers also posted documents purporting to be ID cards of relatives of French soldiers involved in anti-IS operations.","['monde', 'islamic', 'russian', 'image', 'attack', 'tv5', 'hackers', 'stations', 'russiabased', 'group', 'french', 'posted', 'hack']","Image copyright Google+/TV5Monde Image caption Several of the organisations' social media accounts were also hitA cyber attack on the French television network TV5 Monde may have been carried out by Russian-based hackers, police believe.

Carl Sargeant: Inquest witness 'may have lied' to coroner,Former communities minister Carl Sargeant was found dead just four days after being sacked.,[],None,"Image caption Carl Sargeant was found dead after an investigation was launched into his conduct

A witness in the Carl Sargeant inquest may have lied to the coroner, the hearing has been told.

Mr Sargeant, 49, was found hanged by his wife Bernadette on 7 November at his home in Connah's Quay, Flintshire.

A statement from Flintshire council's deputy leader, Bernie Attridge, said he thought ""the sacking killed my friend"".

But Cathy McGahey, counsel for Carwyn Jones, said it appeared Mr Attridge had some ""knowledge of behaviour that would have made Mr Sargeant anxious"".

Mr Sargeant was found dead four days after he was sacked as communities minister by the first minister.

The Labour AM had been accused of behaving inappropriately towards women, which he denied, and the inquest was told ""tangible"" complaints were made weeks before he died.

He left a letter apologising to his family and telling them: ""I have failed you.""

Coroner John Gittins agreed to hear applications on the potential submission of new evidence which has come to light from witnesses including Flintshire council leader Aaron Shotton.

Ms McGahey said: ""Mr Shotton has come forward with a witness statement that contradicts some of Mr Attridge's evidence.

""There is what appears to be a text message from Mr Attridge to Mr Shotton on November 1 2017... and it appears to refer to Mr Sargeant.

""Mr Attridge bets he is shitting bricks... He refers to MPs in Westminster being exposed and it won't be long before AMs are... on the hit list.""

Image copyright Helen Tipper Image caption First Minister Carwyn Jones gave evidence to the inquest on Wednesday

Ms McGahey said Mr Attridge went on to say, on 5 November, that rumours about Mr Sargeant were circulating in the Labour Club and he wanted to discourage people in the Labour group from saying anything in support of him.

He then implied, she said, Mr Sargeant had done something ""that could lead to imprisonment"".

""Mr Attridge and Mr Attridge alone will know exactly what he meant by those,"" she told the coroner, before adding: ""It does appear on the face of it that Mr Attridge has not told you the truth.

""Signing the statement of truth when you know something you are saying is not true, is a contempt of court.""

Mr Gittins heard applications from counsel relating to the submission of this new evidence, but he declined, saying he already had enough to do his job.

Earlier, the inquest heard the first minister warned Mr Sargeant to ""be careful"" over conduct and drinking after an anonymous letter said he was ""not fit to be around women"".

Image copyright Helen Tipper Image caption Leslie Thomas QC questioned Carwyn Jones on how Carl Sargeant's sacking was handled

Speaking at the inquest in Ruthin, Denbighshire, on Wednesday, Mr Jones said he had received an anonymous letter in 2014 from someone in Mr Sargeant's Alyn and Deeside constituency.

""I remember the words 'he's not fit to be around women', but the letter was anonymous. I showed it to Carl,"" he told the hearing.

Mr Jones said he told Mr Sargeant in 2014: ""You need to know... be careful, there's obviously someone who's watching you.

""Be careful how you conduct yourself and how much you drink.""

He said Mr Sargeant ""wasn't an alcoholic"", but the company he kept was ""quite a hard-drinking bunch"".

He told Mr Gittins the pair had known each other since 2001 and had ""never had a cross word"".

Mr Jones did not know Mr Sargeant suffered from depression or had taken anti-depressants, the inquest heard.

Tweet after dismissal

Image copyright Twitter/ @carlsargeant1 Image caption Carl Sargeant tweeted a statement after being sacked by the Welsh Government four days before he died.

Asked when he first became aware of rumours about Mr Sargeant's conduct, he said: ""Rumours are plentiful in politics. Evidence is rare.""

He did not know what the rumours were, but became aware of them on 18 October 2017, the day he held a meeting with senior advisors to discuss the cabinet reshuffle.

One of two complainants who had made allegations about Mr Sargeant put it in writing to the Labour party in October, dating from an event in summer 2017.

Pushed by the coroner why he had not spoken to Mr Sargeant, he said: ""Had I given him more details in terms of the allegations... he'd have known straight away, I suspect, who those people were and that was a risk I couldn't take.""

He said ""the fact we had names"" meant there was ""an obligation to look further"".

Mr Sargeant tweeted a statement on the afternoon he was sacked - highlighting that it related to personal conduct - and Mr Jones said there was ""no need to volunteer the information"".

Mr Gittins responded: ""So that's what happens in politics? We keep secrets because it suits everybody to do so?""

""It's not secrets. It's a gentler way of doing it,"" said Mr Jones.

Image caption Carwyn Jones is stepping down as first minister in December

Ahead of the meeting between the pair, Mr Jones said he had ""a feeling of dread going in that morning... I had lost sleep over it,"" but said it ""had to be done"".

Mr Sargeant's response was ""curious"", and he said he ""did not recognise"" the allegations.

""In politics, that's not a denial,"" Mr Jones said.

He was ""a little panicked but not distraught,"" but Mr Jones said there was ""no reason to doubt that he understood the implications"".

He advised him to speak to his trade union for advice and ""keep your head down"".

But following Mr Sargeant's tweet, he said the Welsh Government had to ""firefight"".

""The press would speculate. Twitter is corrosive,"" he added.

""Because of that tweet there was a media frenzy that made all manner of allegations about Carl that weren't true.""

The inquest heard audio of Mr Jones speaking on a BBC Wales news broadcast on 6 November, the day before Mr Sargeant died.

In it, Mr Jones used the words ""incidents"". The coroner asked him if he saw the difference between that and the word ""allegations"".

""It's quite clear from that news report that the news report is about allegations,"" he replied.

Image caption Leslie Thomas QC is representing the Sargeant family

Mr Jones had said the reshuffle happened on a Friday as Mr Sargeant had been away and if it was held mid-week he would not have had the support of his family on hand.

Leslie Thomas QC, representing the Sargeant family, asked why it was necessary to draw Mr Sargeant's attention to the anonymous letter sent in 2014.

Mr Jones felt it was right to let him know, as the letter had also been sent to Mrs Sargeant.

He had not spoken to Mr Sargeant about a complaint from 2016 because ""the complainant didn't want me to"".

The inquest heard Ann Jones AM acted in a liaison role between the Labour group and Mr Sargeant, and secondly in a pastoral role.

Mr Jones said this happened on the afternoon following Mr Sargeant's dismissal and Ms Jones ""wanted to make sure that Carl was okay from a personal level as well"".

Mr Jones planned to hold a reshuffle in November 2017 because he was in talks with an AM who had left his party, as well as wanting to offer new opportunities to others.

'Complete discretion'

During the course of the discussions, he received the written complaints about Mr Sargeant.

Prior to that, Mr Jones characterised rumours about Mr Sargeant as ""tittle-tattle"", according to evidence from one of his special advisors.

Mr Jones said the written allegations, which came just days before the reshuffle on 3 November, ""could not be ignored as part of the reshuffle process"".

Mr Sargeant, who was being considered for the role of leader of the house, was sacked that day.

Mr Jones confirmed it was ""wholly"" his responsibility who was appointed or moved and he had ""complete discretion"" over the cabinet.

Earlier, Mr Jones' senior special advisor Matthew Greenough was recalled to the inquest to clarify some of the evidence he gave on Tuesday, around the timings of allegations made against Mr Sargeant.

The ""tangible"" complaints referred to alleged incidents in summer 2017, made by women known in court as Miss A and Miss B.

These were reported via the Labour Party to Mr Jones in October 2017. One of two women involved later made a written statement.

'Rumours' about Mr Sargeant

There had previously been two separate allegations in 2016, although one was in the form of an anonymous letter.

Mr Greenough agreed one allegation by a woman known as Miss C could have been made in 2015, but he did not know about it until 2016.

He told the court he was present in the room when the reshuffle where Mr Sargeant lost his job took place and no information regarding any of the women was discussed in his presence.

He told Mr Thomas he did not believe Mr Jones could have had a conversation with anyone without him knowing.

Special advisor Jane Runeckles confirmed there were ""rumours"" about Mr Sargeant, but he was still in consideration for leader of the house at a meeting on 18 October 2017.

Image caption Mr Sargeant's body was found in the utility room of his house in Connah's Quay

The coroner said he struggled to understand how that might still be the case.

""The first minister was absolutely clear at that point that it was tittle-tattle. He had nothing to suggest otherwise,"" she replied.

Mr Sargeant's sacking was precipitated by Mr Greenough receiving the written statement from one complainant on 1 November.

Mr Gittins asked if that was ""the deciding factor in terms of his removal from office"", to which Ms Runeckles replied ""yes"", adding it would have been difficult to postpone a reshuffle.

Mr Sargeant's brother Andy asked whether Ms Runeckles did anything to support him, and she said ""no"", explaining: ""The whim of the electorate is something [politicians] subject themselves to... you go into it knowing that this kind of thing can happen to you.""

'Setting the scene'

Mr Thomas repeatedly questioned Ms Runeckles over the 18 October meeting and any discussion of the rumours around Mr Sargeant, particularly in light of the #MeToo movement and ""political fallout"" in Westminster.

She told the court she did not enquire where the rumours had come from and said they were ""not relevant"", which Mr Thomas challenged. She agreed she could have spoken to Mr Sargeant about the matter, but did not.

Mr Thomas asked if the reshuffle was ""just a convenient way of trying to mask"" the situation surrounding Mr Sargeant. ""Absolutely not,"" she replied.

The first minister was asked why, after allegations from Miss A and Miss B in 2017, Miss C - who made her original allegation in 2016 - was contacted to see if she wished to complain.

He accused Mr Jones of ""setting the scene"" to ""get rid"" of Mr Sargeant.

""I could've removed Carl from the cabinet for no reason at all,"" Mr Jones responded.

He said he felt it was right someone who had come forward in 2016 should now be asked if they wanted to make a complaint.","['sargeants', 'attridge', 'coroner', 'inquest', 'allegations', 'sargeant', 'told', 'carl', 'jones', 'lied', 'rumours', 'witness', 'mr']","Image caption Carl Sargeant was found dead after an investigation was launched into his conductA witness in the Carl Sargeant inquest may have lied to the coroner, the hearing has been told.

There are many many families up and down Britain where drunken parents can cause great upset for their children - and even rip families apart.

The fact that David Hasselhoff has released a statement saying that his daughters were ""concerned for my well-being"" and that he has seen the tape and ""learned from it"" means that he has accepted the problem and is on-side with the tape being shown.

And it's a powerful example of how concerned children can help their parents get through their troubles.

But the video is undeniably strong. One clip shows him struggling to eat a hamburger; in another he says he is ""lonely"" because he has ""trouble in our life"".

A man whose body was found by the M54 motorway more than likely knew his killer, his ex-wife has said.

Surjit Takhar, 37, was reported missing from his home in Oldbury, West Midlands, in October 2008.

His skull and other bone fragments were discovered in Telford, Shropshire, in 2015 by maintenance workers. Police are treating the death as murder.

Mr Takhar's former wife Lavina Sohl said she suspected he had been killed accidentally.

"'It was either die, or get help'","""Sandra"" tells the BBC her life has turned around since attending a project in Glasgow which is an alternative to prison.",[],None,"Image caption ""Sandra"" told Baroness Kennedy she started going to Tomorrow's Women's two years ago and said her life has turned around

Sandra has been an alcoholic for 26 years. She's now in her 40s and had been offending for about 20 years. She got a Community Payback Order as an alternative to prison two years ago, and started going to Tomorrow's Women, a community justice project which deals with the most hard-to-reach women in Glasgow. She hasn't had a drink or committed a crime in well over a year.

Sandra (not her real name) says: ""When I first started coming to Tomorrow's Women, I wouldn't really engage - I was still drinking and I didn't want to face up to my problems. I was frightened.

""But last January, I decided I'd had enough - suicidal thoughts were coming into my head and I asked to go into rehab. Mentally and physically I was just broken. It was either die or get help.

""The staff from Tomorrow's Women helped me get into rehab, they came up to see me all the time. I started receiving trauma counselling. And it's made a massive, massive difference to my life.

""I was drinking because I didn't feel great about myself, I had no confidence because of a trauma experience and incidents that had happened in my life up until my 20s. I just let myself get used and abused, I suppose, for years. I felt that was all I deserved.

""People think projects like this are a soft option, that prison's the hard bit. But I would say dealing with all your problems is harder. I went through every emotion that you could imagine. And at times I wanted to throw in the towel. It was so painful.

""I feel on top of the world now. I've made brilliant friends at Tomorrow's Women. I think the fact that it's all women is important. And the fact that it's a multi-agency service - you're not going from one side of Glasgow to the other. Somebody's helping you with your housing, mental health, all in the one place.

""A few weeks ago, I wasn't well, and the women offered to come up and get my shopping. It's wee things like that. With the lassies and the staff - nothing's fake.

Why is heroin killing so many people?,Heroin deaths in the UK are rocketing - is it time for a radical solution?,[],None,"Warning: Depictions of drug use Lisa used to be married. She had two jobs and was a mum to five kids. She calls it her normal life. Now there’s only one thing on her mind. It’s all Lisa has been thinking about since she woke up. Heroin.

Sitting in a friend’s house, she unwraps the foil carefully. “0.2g in weight, £10 in money,” she says, her eyes fixed on the brown powder. Reaching for a syringe, she wipes away a tear. Staring straight at the heroin, she admits: “I put it before my children.” We have no idea where Lisa got the money for her latest fix, or where she bought it from. We don’t ask. In complete silence she unwraps the foil, reveals the brown powder, and gets the syringe ready. Next the injection - she’s breathing heavily as the heroin courses through her veins.

After a while, her eyes drop. She has a moment in her own world. This is Lisa’s life. It’s the same routine day after day. And in a few hours, she’ll be searching for more.

I know Greg well - we used to be colleagues on the Times - and the extracts of his book live up to his reputation as a journalist - it's splendidly written, well-informed, and right. There are no angry denials pouring forth from Lib Dem HQ this morning.

Based on just the first serialisation in today's paper, there is no new killer fact that makes you drop your toast. We already knew the former Lib Dem leader had a drink problem, we already knew there was a plot to oust him last Christmas.

But that doesn't mean the new detail isn't important. For example, when Mr Kennedy resigned in January, he said he had been fighting alcoholism for eighteen months. According to the book, he had actually had a problem since before he became leader in 1999 and his aides knew all about it even then.

This prompts a big question. Mr Kennedy led his party through two general elections, the Iraq war and many other crucial events - while trying to cope with alcoholism. Did the millions of people who voted for him and his party have a right to know? It's a difficult one.

The conclusion that the current leader, Sir Menzies Campbell, and other senior party figures came to was no. They knew about the problem in 2003 when Mr Kennedy and they came close to revealing all at a news conference that was cancelled at the last minute.

They decided the best thing to do was to offer help to Mr Kennedy in private, urge him to get treatment and hope it went away. It didn't and eventually MPs found the situation untenable and forced Mr Kennedy out in a messy confrontation last January.

Was it a cover-up? ""No"" says the party, just MPs behaving properly and loyally to maintain Mr Kennedy's right to privacy. In other words, it was a cover-up but an honourable one.

The other question is what difference it would have made to voters' behaviour if they had known about Mr Kennedy's drink problem. Seven months on from his resignation, the former leader is still popular in the polls, and the Lib Dem grassroots are still not quite sure what to make of Sir Menzies.

After remaining largely silent since his resignation, Mr Kennedy is in the process of trying return to the political frontline. A big speech is planned for the party conference next month, he's hinted he'd welcome a frontbench post if one came up.

Matt Slater: FA Cup: King of Beers v Health Fears,"Eating horse meat, buying Celine Dion albums, considering Sharon Stone to be a great actress: they do things differently in France and sometimes not just to be contrary. Take the...",[],None,"Eating horse meat, buying Celine Dion albums, considering Sharon Stone to be a great actress: they do things differently in France and sometimes not just to be contrary. Take the sponsorship of sport, for example.

In the UK, we are quite happy for a whisky to sponsor a Formula One team, a brewery to back our premier racing event and now ""the great American lager"" to accompany our most famous football competition.

This could never happen across the Channel.

Twenty years ago, a French government minister called Claude Evin decided to ignore the protests of his country's powerful alcohol industry and ban the direct or indirect advertising of booze on TV and cinema and in all sports facilities from Roland Garros to the local baths.

Sponsorship deals for one of the FA's iconic brands will help pay for its iconic home Photo: Getty

The ""Loi Evin"" was a bold move as French sport was just as addicted to the bottle as British sport is now. There was also the small matter of France's bid to stage the 1998 World Cup, an event partially bankrolled by the same purveyor of faux Bohemia that has just snaffled the FA Cup.

Not now Claude, went the cries from the plonk companies, you can't have a Sepp Club party without the King of Beers. You will scare Fifa off or bankrupt us with your paternalistic meddling.

These companies had just spent the previous decade being completely free to advertise their products in any way they saw fit. Alcohol makes you more successful and better looking? Mais oui!

But this was a dangerous message for a country that drank more than most. So if industry could not be trusted to regulate itself, politicians would do it for them.

Seven years later, France hosted a successful World Cup, even managing to win it, but the Loi Evin held firm and continues to do so despite the repeated efforts of advertisers and their lobbyists to knock it down.

The unveiling of Liverpool's new third kit this week has provoked plenty of comment but it will not be the first time in recent years the ""Reds"" have been forced to wear a strange white shirt. In Rafa Benitez's final season in charge, Liverpool donned a throw-back Carlsberg-free outfit three times: twice on Champions League duty in France and once in fellow booze-banners Norway for a friendly in Oslo. There was no ""cyan"" in that shirt, though.

And French sports fans have grown used to seeing their sides perform admirably in something called the H Cup, which might sound like a Carry On joke but is in fact the same rugby union competition which refreshes the parts etc etc.

But has the Loi Evin worked?

To really answer that question we would have to create two Frances, one with advertising restrictions and one without, and study the difference: no self-respecting Brit could advocate that.

So I have no intention of featuring in one of Ben Goldacre's Bad Science columns by suggesting the Loi Evin is behind the reduction in per capita consumption of alcohol in France from 30 litres in 1960 to 15 litres in 2005. But I will note it.

And I am not the only one. The British Medical Association (BMA), the British Liver Trust, the Royal College of Physicians and assorted other concerned parties have called on the British Government to follow France and Norway's example (not that it is just those two - India, Kenya, Sweden, Ukraine and large parts of Asia have also banned booze ads).

Gerrard models Liverpool's fourth strip

A study by the BMA in 2009 revealed that alcohol-related illnesses were costing the National Health Service £3bn a year and killing 40,000 Britons.

Meanwhile, the drinks industry was spending £800m annually marketing its products. A quarter of that was estimated to be on sports campaigns, making alcohol the second most important sponsor of sport in the UK after the financial services sector.

Given that fact, is it really surprising a cash-strapped FA opted to sell its most prized asset to the Belgian-Brazilian giant Anheuser-Busch InBev and its unfathomably popular brew? After all, the FA already has Carlsberg as a ""partner"" (and those other notable health and fitness brands McDonald's and Mars too) and Carling sponsors English football's second cup competition.

At ""the FA Cup with Budweiser"" launch on Thursday there was much talk about ""iconic brands"" coming together, ""global reach"" being enhanced and ""a bespoke programme to promote responsible drinking to football fans"". And swapping a low-profile energy firm from Dusseldorf for a sponsor that people around the world have actually heard of (if not enjoyed) could be described as a good piece of business, particularly if it brings in the reported £8m a year.

But does that make it right?

I asked the BMA and the answer was an emphatic no.

""By sponsoring events like the FA Cup, alcohol companies are associating their products with a healthy activity and promoting them to a huge audience of young people,"" it said.

""Given the amount spent on sponsorship and promotion, it's not surprising that young people see alcohol as normal, even healthy. The irony is alcohol is one of the leading risk factors for premature death and related to over 60 medical conditions.""

I also spoke to Conservative MP and doctor Sarah Wollaston, who earlier this year proposed a bill calling on the UK to copy the Loi Evin. Wollaston was on a train back to her constituency but her message came through loud and clear.

""This is an entirely inappropriate relationship for the FA to get into,"" she said. ""And as the French have proved, sport does not need to climb into bed with alcohol companies.""

There are other opinions, however. The Portman Group, a trade body set up to represent the UK drinks industry's interests, defended the Budweiser deal.

""There is no reason why alcohol companies should not sponsor major sporting events,"" Portman Group chief executive David Poley said.

""There are strict controls in place to ensure such sponsorship is carried out responsibly. Under these controls, companies cannot target under-18s with alcohol-branded merchandise and, at the very minimum, 75% of the audience must be aged 18 or over.""

Regardless of which side is right, alcohol looks set to remain part of sport.

After all, Budweiser sold its space on the perimeter hoardings at the 1998 World Cup to Casio for £10m and kept hold of its tickets and Fifa partner status. It was back all over the World Cup in 2002 and forcibly ejecting rival brands in South Africa last year.

Even the best-intended laws are powerless to those determined to sidestep them.

It's a 60-minute authored personal exploration of a subject rarely out of the headlines; but because it is partly my personal journey and I am still trying to work out my own ideas, I find myself talking to just about everyone these days about their relationship with alcohol. I'm working with Ronan Feely and Brian Henry Martin from Doubleband Films, and will be reunited with Mark Garrett, who was the cameraman on Frozen North, the documentary I presented back in 2005 about climate change. If there is such a thing as TV magic, Mark is the wizard; so this will be fun. Ronan and Brian are brimming over with ideas. We start filming on Friday.

Before then, I really need to sit still for a long time and think more about where this journey may take me. One of the difficulties posed by a personal exploration on screen is that the presenter needs to decide how much to give of his or her own personal story. This is a story that has touched my own family quite significantly, and I need to negotiate with myself a little to arrive at a settled attitude on how much of that personal stuff I can draw on for the purposes of the programme. As I found out when I presented Sorry For Your Trouble, which examined out relationship with death, a personal exploration format has the potential to touch a lot of people in the audience. So many people wrote to me, phoned the BBC, and stopped me in the street after that documentary was screened because the storied nature of the exploration connected with their own personal stories. Much of that is down to the expert direction of Michael Beattie, who was a delight to work with on the project. If you're out for a drink in Belfast on Friday night, you may bump into our crew in one of the city's better-known venues. I may be wearing a hidden camera.

Most of today was taken up with writing -- a commentary for a radio series about the book of Genesis, which should be broadcast sometime after Easter. I'm up to chapter 17; just 33 to go. John Simpson is producing it, and he's a dab-hand at editing and mixing. We have the actor Jim Norton reading the text of Genesis. Jim has an amazing voice; deep, rich and always authoratative. He has played Einstein in Star Trek, Bishop Brennan in Father Ted, and voiced up the whole of Ulysses in an audio book -- so it's about time he became the voice of God. I spent a hilarious couple of hours a few months ago with Jim and John in studio 3 at Broadcasting House advising hem on how to pronounce Hebrew proper nouns (I knew those Hebrew classes would pay off eventually).

I'm off now to the Queen's Film Theatre: we're just about to record an audience and panel event on the ethics and politics of the global oil trade following a screening of A Crude Awakening: The Oil Crash.

'Have an affair' poster in Dorset criticised,A poster in Dorset for a website offering married people the chance to meet up to have an affair is criticised.,[],None,"Image caption Notes stuck on the poster claim to have found their spouses on the website

A poster in Dorset for a website offering married people the chance to have an affair has been criticised.

The advert for www.AffairsDating.net has been put up by a row of shops in Poole and near a church.

A number of residents have voiced opposition while anonymous signs have been stuck on the poster claiming to have found their spouses on the site.

Affairs Dating refused to comment but said it planned to roll out its advertising campaign nationwide.

The site, which is registered in Poole and is one of many similar on the internet, advertises to ""likeminded people who are looking to have an affair, when divorce is not an option"".

'Cheating husband'

Pastor Matthew Hosier, from the nearby Gateway Church, said: ""A marriage is meant to be faithfulness, it is meant to be fruitfulness and is meant to be living for the other person rather than yourself.

""So a website which is designed to cut against all those principles which are what the church has taught for the last 2,000 years I would see as a very negative thing.""

Image caption The owners of the website said they planned to roll out the posters nationwide

A number of notes have also appeared on the poster.

One read: ""I have just found my cheating husband on this website.""

But people who use similar sites have defended the service.

One man, who did not want to be named, said: ""My marriage is an unhappy marriage. [After] 30 years of marriage people presume you are happy and everything is wonderful but it is not.

""My wife is an alcoholic, and as I only have one life I just feel the need to go out and find women company.""

Summit planned to help military personnel,The Labour Party is to host a summit with the main military charities amid growing claims of discrimination against service personnel.,"['Sima Kotecha', 'Bbc Today Programme Reporter']",None,"Image caption One in five military personnel has been refused service in a bar or hotel

The Labour Party is to host a summit with leading military charities on how to deal with discrimination against the armed forces.

A recent poll suggested one in five military personnel had been refused service in a bar or hotel over fears they would cause trouble.

Labour is calling on the government to make it a criminal offence.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said discrimination against its servicemen and women is unacceptable.

This programme has heard from dozens of military personnel who say they have been refused entry into pubs and clubs over the last couple of years.

The owners of a bar in Coventry were recently criticised for turning away two soldiers in uniform who wanted non-alcoholic drinks.

They later apologised.

Yeah, some soldiers are trouble makers I get that - but we're not all the same. That's like saying a group of football players come into a pub and cause trouble so now no more football players can come in again British Army private

But some pub owners say troops often cause trouble which ends in violence and damage to their property.

Labour wants a new bill to outlaw discrimination against service personnel.

Stories of soldiers going to war for their country and then being barred from pubs when they return home have been reported in the newspapers for years.

Sir Simon Wessley, director of Kings College London's centre for military research, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme 2% of people in the UK have openly hostile views to people in the armed forces.

But dozens of soldiers and veterans have contacted the programme in recent weeks, claiming it is getting worse.

They claim some pub landlords refuse to let them in because they are worried they will cause violence.

Refused entry

A 21-year-old private, who does not wish to be named, told me how he and his comrades were refused entry to their local nightclub.

He said: ""We got in a queue, none of us were drunk, I don't drink myself so I definitely wasn't drunk. And when we got to the bouncer at the front of the door, he said, 'Sorry lads, it's not soldier night tonight.' He thought we were going to cause trouble.""

His words resonate with the dozens of military personnel who have contacted us through social media, email, and text messages.

A poll conducted by the Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft in 2012 suggested one in five soldiers had been refused service in bars and hotels and more than one in 20 had experienced violence while in uniform.

The Labour MP for Dunfermline and West Fife, Thomas Docherty, initiated a call for new legislation that would make it illegal to discriminate against military personnel by refusing to serve them in hotels and pubs.

The bill would also mean certain offences committed towards members of the armed forces would be treated as ""aggravated"" which would mean a harsher penalty for the person convicted of the crime.

Rowdy reputation

Mr Docherty said British soldiers did have a reputation for being rowdy and provocative but he insisted they had changed.

He said: ""There is this kind of media perception historically but the Army has taken huge steps in recent years to change its culture and I think society hasn't caught up with the changes the Army has made.""

But research from King's College London suggests there is a strong correlation between psychological trauma incurred in places like Afghanistan and Iraq and aggressive behaviour back home.

A recent study published in the Lancet Medical Journal supported this research. But results of other studies show abusive behaviour is not always linked to returning from deployment - and that the risk of violence may be partly related to a soldier's upbringing or early anti-social behaviour.

A former pub landlady who wants to remain anonymous said most service personnel were troublesome.

In an email she said: ""Surely questions should be asked about why these serving members of the forces feel the need to go out and get blind drunk, fight and then end up crying.""

The government said the military covenant that was enshrined into law in 2011 showed its commitment to the armed forces and if people were keen to support the military they could join the Community Covenant scheme which is about local communities doing more to understand the forces and the problems they face.

The MoD has invested £30m into the project over four years.

The Minister for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans, Mark Francois, added that he had no requests from Army chiefs for a new law.

Drink-drive detections down on previous Christmas period,PSNI say 322 drink drivers were arrested - 38 fewer than in the same period for 2017/18.,[],None,"Image copyright PA Image caption More than 11,000 people were tested during this year's operation

More than 300 drink-drivers were detected by the PSNI in the run-up to and over Christmas.

The figure was down by more than 10% on the previous year.

The youngest person detected was 14 years old, while the oldest was 83 years old.

According to preliminary figures released on Monday by police, 322 drink drivers were arrested - 38 fewer than in the same period for 2017/18.

The 2018/19 winter anti-drink drive operation ran from 30 November until 1 January.

More than 11,000 people were tested during the operation.

Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said one of those drivers was detected at more than four times the drink drive limit, with a reading of 153 mcg of alcohol in 100 ml of breath.

The legal limit is 35 mcg of alcohol in 100 ml of breath.

Image caption ACC Alan Todd said detections were made at all times of the day

Seventy two of the 322 people arrested were women, as compared to 49 out of a total of 360 during the previous campaign.

ACC Todd said detections were made at all times of the day on roads across Northern Ireland and that drivers were also arrested for being under the influence of drugs.

""In one incident, after being involved in a collision, a driver was arrested for driving under the influence of drugs. Approximately £3,000 worth of suspected drugs were recovered from the vehicle, leading to the driver being further arrested on suspicion of a number of drug offences.

'Shameful'

""In another incident, police detected and arrested a HGV driver returning to their place of work, having carried out their morning deliveries.

""It's disappointing that despite our repeated and well publicised warnings, a minority of people completely disregarded the safety of themselves and others by taking the shameful and incredibly dangerous risk of driving after drinking.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption In December, NI Crimestoppers saw a 65% increase in calls with information about drink driving

This year's operation was also supported by the independent charity Crimestoppers, which gave the public the opportunity to provide information about drink drivers anonymously.

Sue Brew, regional manager for Northern Ireland Crimestoppers, said that during December, the organisation saw a 65% increase in calls with information about drink driving, compared to the average over the previous seven months.

""As we said at the outset of this campaign, by trusting us with your information, you'll remain 100% anonymous. Always. We never take personal details and calls cannot be traced. Together we can help protect those you care about.""

Checkpoints

ACC Todd added that in the months ahead, police ""will continue to use all the powers and legislation at our disposal, including the authorised checkpoints, to detect people who insist on driving after having taken drugs or alcohol"".

In December, BBC News NI reported that the PSNI cannot fully enforce tougher drink-driving laws introduced almost three years ago as they do not yet have access to breathalysers capable of testing lower blood alcohol levels introduced by the assembly in April 2016.

Writersroom Blog,The BBC writersroom blog has news and information for new writers about working with the BBC.,[],None,"Tim Wright is the writer of digital experiences including Online Caroline, Mount Kristos, and In Search of Oldton. His two new plays, Say What You Want To Hear, will air shortly on Radio 4 - and you can be a part of them by sending in your own swywths.

We've asked Tim to write two pieces for us: one before the first play goes out, and one after the last play.

Take it away, Tim.

Throughout my career as a freelance digital writer and interactive content producer I've been involved in some pretty weird pitches - from persuading the chief executive of a large ISP to invest in an online fantasy Greek island comedy through to being interviewed by NASA about an amateur golfing trip to the moon planned, rehearsed and controlled by an online audience of ""moongolfers"".

It's this erratic world of dotcommery, tomfoolery and audience participation that inspired me to write Say What You Want To Hear: two afternoon plays for Radio 4 combined with a website for collecting people's secret thoughts or ""swywths"".

What is a swywth? Well, it's a word I invented to describe a secret thought - specifically the kind of secret thought that knocks around your head regularly but that never normally gets said out loud.

For some, a swywth is the pep talk you give yourself in the morning when you look in the mirror. For others, it's the judgement silently passed on colleagues in yet another boring meeting. Or perhaps it's a regret, a cherished memory, an ambition - or some nonsense from childhood that haunts you as you stare out of the bus window.

In the plays, I attempt to tell the story of Mike and Erik who invent the online ""SayWhatYouWantToHear"" service for people who'd like to get their swywths read out loud and sent back to them as sound files, to carry around on an iPod for evermore. Imagine - Evan Davis saying ""You're OK"" to you every day; or Kirsty Young repeating ""Your nose is just the right size for your face"" over and over again.

Mike's & Erik's mad obsession for Internet fame and glory leads them into ever more absurd situations - both online and IRL (In Real Life).

It's a story about how saying things out loud rather than keeping them to yourself can cause all kinds of problems - and create surprising opportunities.

It's a story about how new communication technologies are changing the way we talk to each other - and who we end up talking to.

Put Your Secret Thoughts Into A Play

It's also a story that the audience can help to shape by adding their swywths to the mix.

I'm aiming to put as many of other people's swywths into the plays as possible - and I want to show how some of these contributions can end up pushing characters around and colouring the events in the play (especially in Play 2)

On Radio 4's website right now we've made a working version of the swywth system so that people really can send in their swywths to a website and get them read out and recorded by Radio 4 announcers, presenters, and actors.

A selection of your submitted swywths will then be used to in the Afternoon Plays themselves - to add atmosphere to scenes, to provide commentary on specific situations, to influence the way some characters behave.

I'm hoping that as the swywth bank grows, we can get more and more eminent and surprising speakers to read out your swywths. Personally, I'm hoping, for example, to get Harrison Ford to read out mine. A crazy dream I know - but no less crazy than some of your swywths I imagine.

If you fancy your secret thoughts appearing in a radio play, send in your swywths soon. Who knows where it will take us?

Radio 4 listeners may remember, for example, In Search of Oldton, a radio play and website (and a pack of cards) that allowed the audience to contribute memories of a town that had never really existed - and thus create a fictional landscape in which a story about my dad could breathe.

As a writer I really enjoy the improvisational element that comes with interacting with an audience as we work together to make something meaningful and entertaining.

I also enjoy the subversion of that old transmitter-receiver model where the writer writes and the audience listens. Now we all get a chance to have our say, and a writer has the opportunity to listen, collaborate and manage a project in a way that it was all too easy to avoid when locked away in complete isolation privately consulting one's muse (or staring at a blank page).

Digital fiction writing is just so much more social than ordinary writing, I find - and all the better for it.

These types of project, mind, are not so easy to get into production. Persuading the powers that be in Radio 4 to create a swywth site to support a drama about a fictional online service was a long and arduous process that owes much to the persistence and vision of executive producer Jeremy Mortimer.

It was, in effect, yet another weird pitch.

But in getting drama people, interactive people, business affairs people and - most importantly - the audience all to come together in this way, it feels like we are slowly but surely starting to learn what the benefits of a ""cross-platform"" approach to storytelling might be.

And what are these benefits? Well, words that spring to mind are: inclusiveness, responsiveness, relevance, diversity, portability, and playfulness. These are all qualities I'd like to inject into my practice. Most of all, though, I'd hope that swywthery and other forms of Internet tomfoolery turn out to be fun.

For, in the words of a famous swywth: If it's not fun, you're not doing it right.

The MI5 spy who saved children from a UK bomb attack,"Former MI5 agent ""Tom Marcus"" risked his life for more than eight years, secretly tracking Islamic extremists and IRA groups.","['Monica Soriano', 'Victoria Derbyshire Programme']",None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Former MI5 officer ""Tom Marcus"" tells Victoria Derbyshire how he disguised himself as a homeless person to foil an imminent terror plot

As an MI5 agent ""Tom Marcus"" risked his life for more than eight years, secretly tracking Islamic extremists and IRA dissidents on the streets of Britain. But when he left MI5 - with a CV full of inexplicable holes - he found himself taking jobs in a call centre and burger bar.

Tom Marcus is still jittery three years after retiring as a spy, he tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Walking down the street, he sometimes sees suspicious behaviour where there is none - shady people lurking in doorways; unusual bulges in coats; nervous, furtive glances.

Tom - not his real name, it can't be used for security reasons - saw plenty during his eight years as an MI5 surveillance officer to make him suspicious.

On one occasion he helped thwart a plan to blow up two coaches full of schoolchildren returning from a trip to France.

Undercover as a homeless man, and positioned near a mosque, he had noticed that a young Muslim man he had been tracking - who had fought with militant Islamist group Boko Haram in Africa before returning to the UK - had entered the place of worship but not left it. He had also counted more women leaving the building than going in.

He decided that one of the ""women"" leaving must have been the male extremist disguised in a burka. He informed his superiors, and the man - found to have six home-made bombs in his car - was arrested. The bombs were all set to go off at the same time via a mobile phone found on the suspect, meaning Tom almost certainly saved lives that day.

The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.

Watch the full interview with Tom here.

The biggest operation in which Tom was involved stopped a planned bombing of a shopping centre in Manchester over an Easter weekend, potentially saving hundreds of lives. This was one part of a highly co-ordinated attack on people in the UK and US, directed from Pakistan, which also aimed to explode car bombs at the site of the Twin Towers on the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Tom himself became a target for an attempted beheading when extremists developed a plan to kidnap MI5 operatives in the UK. The extremists had assigned people to watch the spies while they were following a suspect, and had covered the floor of a house in Kentish Town, north London, with plastic sheeting in anticipation of taking one captive. A black flag, three butchers' knives and a video camera, suggesting it would be filmed, were also found at the house.

Tom - who has written his memoirs, Soldier Spy - says that were it not for the extremists' ""targets team"" backing out at the last moment, he would not be here to tell the tale.

CV gap

In the end, the job caught up with Tom. He suffered nightmares about being attacked and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), returning to civilian life in 2013. He feels he's recovered now.

He also struggled to find another job. Because of the anonymity required by MI5, Tom, who joined the Army at the age of 16 before moving on to the security services, has a large gap in his CV.

""It's been hugely difficult to get a job,"" he says. ""Working as an MI5 surveillance officer is seen as a job for life - so when you have to come out it's very difficult to figure out what job you can do.

""You can't answer the question about what you've been doing for the last 10 to 15 years in a job interview properly because you'd be breaking the Official Secrets Act.""

Image caption MI5 headquarters in London

""Some people come up with a Ministry of Defence cover story,"" he says, ""but trying to explain the skills you say you have for a made-up story just unravels - and I wouldn't feel comfortable doing that.

""So, work-wise, I just started at the bottom of the pile again. I got an MI5 pension but I had to make money by working in call centres and flipping burgers to build up work experience.""

He is now a full-time writer.

""The only really well-paid options for someone like me were in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, but I just couldn't risk my life doing that.

""It was never an option. I didn't want my PTSD to come back. And no amount of money is worth risking being caught and beheaded.""

'Mr and Mrs Smith'

Part of the reason for Tom's concern is that, while working as a spy, he married a fellow special operations agent and they had a son together.

""People used to joke about it, calling us Mr and Mrs Smith,"" he says, referring to the married spies in a film of the same name, starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. But, unlike the Hollywood actors, Tom's marriage has endured.

Tom, who grew up in poverty in northern England - his father an alcoholic ex-soldier who killed himself - takes extra care to make sure his son is safe at all times. He had the boy's clothes tagged so that he could be traced via GPS if he was captured on the way to or from his nursery. His sleeping bag at home is tagged for the same reason.

But, despite these precautions, Tom thinks the UK, which has not seen a multiple-fatality terrorist attack since the London bombings of 7 July 2005, is ""the safest place in the world"".

It is, he says, served by the ""best group of intelligence agencies in the world"" in MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. But they face growing and varied challenges.

""The tactics change completely,"" says Tom - who monitored suspected spies from Russia and China, and spied on the Continuity IRA, during his career.

""When you are watching an IRA terrorist you have to be careful about having no kit that could identify them. They're very good at counter-surveillance so could spot an MI5 officer unless they were very careful.

""Islamic extremists are normally quite settled in their local communities - and so the MI5 officers need to be very aware and sensitive about how they move in and out of these local areas so as not to draw attention to themselves.

""The Russians are so aware and in tune to surveillance operations from other secret services. If they suspect they're being watched they just won't do anything to do with their intelligence activities. You have have to watch Russian spies from a distance and never have the same people watching them.

""There is no one target who's easier or more difficult to watch - it's just different depending on who you are watching.""

Of course, Tom says, it only takes one successful terrorist to create havoc on a grand scale.

""But if you do get frightened watching the news,"" he adds, ""just be confident that everything is being done to keep you safe.""

Tom Marcus's account of events has been vetted and cleared for publication by MI5 as part of his memoirs. Names and some specific details in the book have been changed in order to protect colleagues and ensure current and future investigations are not jeopardised.

J M Barrie,1860 - 1937,[],None,"Barrie’s most famous and best loved work is undoubtedly his play Peter Pan, performed since 1904 and most recently immortalised in film in 2003. The story is the classic tale of the child that does not want to grow up and Barrie clearly felt that it was, in part, the condition of humanity to feel always in exile from the innocence and freedoms of childhood. The societal constraints of middle-class domestic reality are enacted in the Bloomsbury scenes while the Never-Land is a world free of these Victorian social constraints, a world in which sexuality and morality are crucially ambivalent.

From this point of view, the familial nucleus represented by the Darling Children acts as a metaphor for social order and stability while Peter and the Lost Boys exist out with parental (and by implication societal) control. The brutish pirate scenes, in which the Darling Boys indulge with relish (although Peter himself also indulges, and is both infantile and devilish) are the embodiment of anarchic disorder and in this way represent the innate, but repressed, desire for social deviance. Similarly, Wendy can be regarded as the epitome of ‘the good wife and mother’, a role which is playfully challenged by the more flirtatious and untamed Tinker Bell in the parallel dimension of Never Land. George Bernard Shaw’s description of the play as ‘ostensibly a holiday entertainment for children but really a play for grown-up people’, suggests his understanding of the deeper social allegories at work in Peter Pan.

Perhaps the best known, though by no means the finest, of Barrie’s fictional output are his early Thrums stories, Auld Licht Idylls (1888), A Window in Thrums (1889) and The Little Minister (1891). Literary criticism of these works has been unfavourable, tending to disparage these early writings as sentimental and nostalgic depictions of a parochial Scotland far from the realities of the industrialised nineteenth century. Criticism has perhaps judged these early works too harshly. For one thing, regionalism was in fashion at the turn of the century, as exemplified in the fiction of Thomas Hardy and George Elliot. Moreover, Barrie’s descriptions of humble life are acutely observed and the painstaking detail he devotes to describing the conditions in which the rural poor lived offsets some of the more idealised and romantic characterisations and plots. The Thrums tales do not ignore the problems of alcoholism and temptations of adultery in lives characterised by boredom, monotony and poverty.

Many of J. M. Barrie’s stories were drawn from his mother and his own memories of Kirriemuir life, and Barrie is unusually faithful to the dialect patterns of his native community at a time when the commercial demand for easily digestible and ‘polite’ English prose was particularly strong. A re-assessment of the value of his early fiction should note that one of the pervasive themes of the Thrums tales is that of change and, in particular, the movement from cottage industries to large scale industrial cities. If Barrie’s Thrums fiction does tends towards the nostalgic and the idealised, it is, in part, because his books sought to represent the values of a community life that Barrie perceived to be fast fading from view.

Barrie wrote many other works of value besides those for which he is best known. In drama, The Admirable Crichton (1902) is a bold analysis of the class structure and prejudices of Edwardian society. The play enacts a modern fable whereby the values of an aristocratic family are literally isolated (the family being stranded on a desert island) and deconstructed in a play which debates the conventional ideals of class and gender. Gender roles and restrictions are also skilfully satirised in Barrie’s excellent and neglected play What Every Woman Knows (1908).

In fiction Sentimental Tommy (1896) and its sequel Tommy and Grizel (1900) give the lie to the idea that Barrie is a facile, sentimental writer. These novels offer a complex psychological study of the impulse of sentimentalism itself, characterized by Barrie as the inability to sustain strong emotional feeling oneself whilst being able to instinctively merge into the feelings of others. It is this trait, Barrie suggests, like Joyce in his Portrait of the Artist As A Young Man, that is both the gift and the curse of the writer, and is the romantic allure as well as the impenetrability of Tommy himself.

A summary of Barrie’s writing should not neglect his final prose masterpiece Farewell Miss Julie Logan (1932), a haunting short novel drawing on the folkloric and ballad traditions passed on to Barrie by his mother. The story describes a young minister’s enchantment under the spell of the amorphous Julie Logan, thought to be the ghost of a Jacobite heroine believed to have sheltered the Young Pretender. The novel maintains a powerful ambivalence, common to Scottish writing, between the spectral evocation of the haunted Scottish landscape and the powerful rendering of a fractured psyche torn by repressed desire and human isolation. This novel epitomises the best of Barrie’s work in which the condition of exile and the predicament of human isolation is the basis for the best of his fantasy and the most profound of his considerable psychological perception.","['j', 'peter', 'fiction', 'barrie', 'barries', 'young', 'social', 'best', 'play', 'early', 'thrums', 'm']","Barrie’s most famous and best loved work is undoubtedly his play Peter Pan, performed since 1904 and most recently immortalised in film in 2003.

Welsh Lib Dems challenged over William Powell warning,The Welsh Conservatives say they want more details from the Lib Dems about the action taken by the party after a complaint of inappropriate behaviour was made against one of its AMs.,[],None,"Image caption William Powell has issued an unreserved apology

The Welsh Conservatives say they want more details from the Lib Dems about the action taken by the party after a complaint of inappropriate behaviour was made against one of its AMs.

Mid and West Wales AM William Powell made an unreserved apology to a female activist after an incident in 2011.

The Lib Dems said Mr Powell was given a formal written warning last year.

But the Conservatives want clarification about whether it has satisfied the person who came forward.

It has emerged Mr Powell had been given a formal written warning by his party.

A Welsh Conservative spokesman said: ""We want clarification about what a written warning means in practice and whether it has satisfied the person who came forward with the allegation.""

A statement from the Liberal Democrats on Saturday said Mr Powell was told that any future misdemeanour could result in more serious sanctions being imposed.

The Conservatives said they would like to know what those sanctions could be.

The woman who complained, now 21, alleged that in 2011 Mr Powell gave her and two other women the strong alcoholic drink absinthe, touched her leg and put his hands round their waists.

The Lib Dems confirmed the warning.

The incident involving Mr Powell, his party's agriculture spokesman, was reported in the Daily Mail.

In a statement on Saturday, the Welsh Lib Dems said they had received an anonymous complaint in May last year about Mr Powell's behaviour in an incident in June 2011.

The complainant had spoken to the chair of her local party, the statement said.

Written warning

She said she did not want to pursue a formal grievance procedure and wished to remain anonymous, but wanted the party to be aware of the issue.

The Welsh Lib Dems said the complaint was treated seriously, a report was compiled and passed to their chief whip in Cardiff Bay, Aled Roberts.

Mr Powell was interviewed by Mr Roberts and given a formal written warning that such behaviour would not be tolerated.

He was told any future misdemeanour could result in ""more serious sanctions being imposed"".

The party says that no further complaint has been received since.

Mr Powell said in a statement: ""I am aware of an anonymous complaint having been made.

""The complaint was put to me by the chief whip and I cooperated fully with him in this matter.

""I apologised to the chief whip and offered an unreserved apology, through him, to anyone else for any hurt or offence caused and I would certainly wish to do so again, in writing or in person.""","['william', 'welsh', 'warning', 'lib', 'statement', 'written', 'party', 'powell', 'dems', 'challenged', 'complaint', 'mr']","The Lib Dems said Mr Powell was given a formal written warning last year.

Radio Programme Information from Saturday 3 January to Friday 9 January,Search page,[],None,"Sunday Feature: Thom Gunn: Appropriate Measures

Author Colm Tóibín profiles the Anglo-American poet, Thom Gunn (1929-2004), the self-professed lover of ‘loud music, bars and boisterous men’, whose tightly-wrought poetry imposed control and order upon his hedonistic lifestyle.

It's just over a decade since Gunn died aged 74, leaving behind a legion of admirers who adored the thrilling tension in his work between its wild, often explicit subject matter, and Elizabethan verse forms of Gunn's literary heroes, Donne and Shakespeare.

Gunn rose to prominence aged only 25, when his first volume Fighting Terms was published, just a year after he graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge. Its purity of language and use of traditional metrics led Gunn to be bracketed with Philip Larkin, Ted Hughes and others as ‘the Movement’– a loose group of poets whose cool, spare verses set them in opposition to the overblown imagery and linguistic excess of 1940s poetry, particularly Dylan Thomas.

A move to the USA that same year would change Gunn's life forever. Following his American lover, Kitay, across the Atlantic, he found himself beguiled by Harley Davidsons, leather jackets and the rock n’ roll of his adopted homeland – and later, the LSD, free- love and gay bathhouses of 1960s San Francisco – all of which he chronicled vividly in his poetry.

His British critics were appalled, for them, Gunn had sadly 'gone bad', squandering his dazzling intellect in debauched experience and worse of all – experiments in free verse. But in the USA it was a different story, as Gunn chronicled LSD trips, sexual adventures and street vagrants in a poetic voice reminiscent of Thomas Wyatt or Ben Jonson.

Gunn would finally receive universal acclaim with his 1992 volume The Man With Night Sweats – a profound meditation on the effect of AIDS on the people and community that he loved, and his own feelings on remaining HIV-negative. Yet Gunn was increasingly struggling to write – and as his poetic inspiration dried up, he began to engage in increasingly risky behaviour, endangering his life as he sought out new adventures of experience.

Irish writer and poet Tóibín grew up furtively reading Gunn in a society where his own homosexuality was officially proscribed. He guides listeners through the themes of control and experience in Gunn's work, and explores the single most shattering event in Gunn's life – one which, Tóibín argues, precipitated the outpouring of his mature poetry and construction of his poetic identity - the suicide of Gunn's mother, when he was only 15.

With contributions from Mike Kitay, Bob Bair, August Kleinzahler, Clive Wilmer, Wendy Lesser, Joshua Weiner, Tom Sleigh, Anne Winters, Jim Powell, and Don Baird.

Radio Programme Information from Saturday 29 December to Friday 4 January,Search page,[],None,"The Real Lives Of Spies

Another chance to hear BBC Radio 5 Live’s exclusive interviews with spies from MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. Six spies from the three intelligence agencies share the reality of their jobs with Nihal Arthanayake.

They reveal what they think of the portrayal of their jobs in hit TV shows like Bodyguard and Killing Eve, and they declare that aspects of James Bond are actually true – but in real life they say they have better gadgets than 007!

In the current climate the work of the intelligence services is under close scrutiny and demands on the services are growing. Dia who works at GCHQ tells Nihal: “It’s really important to acknowledge how many [plots] we have ended up stopping and how many people we have protected, but that doesn’t necessarily always make interesting news.”

Ameesha has worked with MI5 for two years, and loved hit BBC drama Killing Eve: “I think the acting was incredible. That’s one thing that stood out for me… But yeah there are moments where you just wanna, like, smash the TV screen and you’re just like ‘no that’s not true!’""

John reveals that aspects of James Bond are actually true.”We do actually have a ‘Q’ - ‘Q’ actually is a real thing. We have some brilliant technologists that supply us with all kinds of gadgets that we use, only our stuff is better than Bond’s!”","['think', 'thats', 'q', 'programme', 'real', 'spies', '29', 'nihal', 'information', 'radio', 'services', 'thing', 'actually', 'tv']","The Real Lives Of SpiesAnother chance to hear BBC Radio 5 Live’s exclusive interviews with spies from MI5, MI6 and GCHQ.

Three perspectives on tackling reoffending on Teesside,"A victim of crime, a former criminal and a judge offer their thoughts on how to stop criminals reoffending.",[],None,"The government is expected later this year to unveil measures to tackle the problem of record criminal reoffending rates.

Recent government figures say Durham and Tees Valley has the joint highest rate of reoffending in the country, along with Merseyside.

Thirty per cent of offenders in the area commit further crimes within 12 months.

The Ministry of Justice is currently holding a consultation into effective ""punishment and reform"", looking at how to stop offenders repeatedly cycling through the criminal justice system.

On Teesside three people, with three different experiences of crime, have their own ideas.

The victim

Image caption Rape victims are granted perpetual anonymity under law

Jo, from Darlington, was raped in 2004. Six years later she met her attacker.

""It was absolutely fantastic. I wanted to get my feelings across to him.""

She believes restorative justice - allowing offenders to come face to face with victims - can help cut reoffending.

""I'd been told that he'd been doing victim empathy work in prison.

""But nobody could tell him exactly what he'd done to me and my family apart from me,"" she said.

""He hadn't considered the wider family. He hadn't considered what he'd done to my mum, my dad and my husband, no-one had spoken to him about that.

""He did apologise and it was sincere - he was crying when he said it - and I have been told since that he's making fantastic progress now.""

The former re-offender

Jodie Hind, from Stockton, has spent most of his adult life in prison.

""I think it happened early, somewhere in childhood, something wasn't quite right.

""I never felt I belonged anywhere. I had a father who was alcoholic,"" he said.

His use of legal terms and criminal slang betray his past - he talks about ""twocing"" and ""taking without consent"" - what people outside the justice system would call stealing cars.

He progressed through theft and drug dealing to burglary, once addiction had ""set in"".

""I just could not put the drugs down,"" he said.

""I was beat into submission, I'd had enough. I'd simply had enough.

""There was nowhere else I could go. I was either going to die or spend the rest of my life in prison.""

His father stopped drinking and set him a ""good example"" which Jodie felt he had to follow although ""the damage had set in"".

""What I had to do was stop blaming everything in and about me, family, whatever had happened.

""Putting my hand up and asking for help. I had to make every effort that I could. I still do it.

""I'm not out the woods now. I'm still the same Jodie, nothing much has changed.

""And that's all I can do - keep it honest and to the next person maybe give them hope that they too can do it.""

He is now part of a programme which tries to offer offenders, through the experience of former criminals, an alternative to a life of crime.

The judge

Image caption Judge Peter Fox said ""relative poverty"" had an effect on re-offending rates

The most senior judge on Teesside, Judge Peter Fox QC, says alcohol, drugs and the poor state of the economy has played a role in rates of re-offending in the north-east of England.

""I think time on a young man's or, for that matter, a young woman's hands is a very serious matter,"" he said.

""That's not to say there wasn't serious crime in this region when there was full employment, there was, but that was for different social reasons, I think.

""I think seeing a lot of luxury and affluence around you and not having any hope of having a slice yourself may be a factor.

""And then I pass a sentence which I hope will deter the person - but you can't lock everyone up.

""To say you want to stop re-offending is really to say you want to stop offending.""","['think', 'justice', 'jodie', 'perspectives', 'stop', 'set', 'judge', 'tackling', 'teesside', 'offenders', 'say', 'reoffending', 'life']","The government is expected later this year to unveil measures to tackle the problem of record criminal reoffending rates.
