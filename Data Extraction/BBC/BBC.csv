Every university 'needs' Alcoholics Anonymous meetings,Alcoholics Anonymous says the number of younger people attending their meetings is on the increase.,,2018-07-31T16:54:32+00:00,"Image copyright Getty Images

Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings should take place in universities across the UK, student leaders have said.

Charity AA says the number of younger people attending their meetings is on the increase.

NUS Wales president Gwyneth Sweatman said Cardiff University's sessions for problem drinkers, one of the first of its kind, have made a big difference.

One student said the help she received turned her life around.

Cardiff undergraduate ""Marie"" said alcohol pushed her life at university to the edge.

At her lowest ebb, she drank 15 pints of cider a day, was arrested and risked being kicked off her course.

She said: ""It was affecting my work significantly.

""I wasn't concentrating in meetings, I couldn't focus, I was erratic in my behaviour and my decisions.""

""I wasn't turning up, it was having a really negative effect on my mental health and that was spiralling, really awful anxiety and depression and suicide-based thoughts.""

The latest official data suggest young people are drinking less.

However, Dr Mani Mehdikhani, a trustee at Alcoholics Anonymous, said the number of younger attendees at meetings was on the up.

""Looking at our own internal AA surveys that we conduct every five years, every time a survey is undertaken we have increasingly larger numbers of younger people coming as new-comers to AA.

""The last survey in 2015, about 33% of our newcomers were under 40 and I'm sure a big percentage were in the university student-age group.""

Image caption The weekly AA meeting at Cardiff University's student union is for anyone who wants to stop drinking.

Cardiff University also has a student counselling and a well-being team which provides support for ""some of the underlying difficulties associated with, or directly linked to, alcohol misuse"".

Jennifer Kent, a vice president at the union, said: ""For us it feels like a really good way of integrating the students and the community here, and it's also important that, by bringing it here, the students don't feel stigmatised.""

NUS Wales president, Gwyneth Sweatman said she thought the AA meetings idea was ""absolutely brilliant"", and one which she would ""love"" to see replicated across the UK - similar to the United States, where college campaigns AA meetings are more common.","['aa', 'meetings', 'student', 'wasnt', 'really', 'president', 'university', 'wales', 'alcoholics', 'universitys', 'needs', 'younger', 'anonymous']","Image copyright Getty ImagesAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings should take place in universities across the UK, student leaders have said.

Members of Alcoholics Anonymous are marking its 75th anniversary, but what really goes on inside the group's meetings?

David looks, in a word, respectable.

Bespectacled, and in a polo shirt and khaki shorts, he could be any respectable middle-aged man.

He sits in a circle of other respectable-looking people in a church hall in a well-to-do part of Washington. Without knowing the context, as he prepares to speak, one might guess that this was a heritage group, ready to save a historic warehouse, or a meeting of concerned residents, demanding traffic-calming measures.

Instead, when David opens his mouth, he starts to talk about his first use of drugs at the age of 12.

Later he talks about his conscious decision to drink himself to death.

Easy eloquence

There is the revelation of small-time drug smuggling trips to South America and a life of profound lows.

But he has an easy eloquence.

""I have fond memories of the moronic quality of being drunk,"" he says.

People do feel shame and guilt when they do things that are bad - in AA you learn to be shameless and guiltless Jack Trimpey , Rational Recovery

""My story is getting far away mentally. It is almost like the Peloponnesian War now.""

The others in the group also speak enthusiastically, talking of trials and tribulations, of their relationship to drink and how they came to be part of AA.

One gum-chewing, room-dominating woman contrasts life as a high-powered sober Washingtonian with her previous pre-AA life in a series of expansive arm gestures. Another man quietly and movingly recounts his son's troubles with the law.

It's impossible to say whether these individuals were always raconteurs or whether their storytelling matured as they took the 12 Steps.

'Higher power'

Certain lines provoke laughter in the group.

""The only thing I knew for sure about my problem was it wasn't a drinking problem,"" deadpans one man. ""I knew you had to drink too much to have a drinking problem and I could never drink enough.""

Image caption The AA dates its foundation to its co-founder's last drink

There are other phrases that are reverentially repeated. Life became ""unmanageable"" and a ""higher power"" has been at work.

A 70-year-old salesman talks about a life where money was made in computers but years were lost to vodka.

A woman talks of her travels and a reassuring fact. ""There are rooms like this all over the world where crazy people get to talk.""

Of the 11 men and three women in the room, eight have been sober for more than 20 years.

And their meeting is in a long tradition that stretches back to 10 June 1935, to the day Robert Smith - better known as Dr Bob - had his last drink. He had been working with AA co-founder Bill Wilson, now usually referred to as Bill W.

Fictional depictions

The organisation they created has helped millions give up drinking and rebuild their lives.

And the meetings, with the 12-Step Programme that is at the heart of AA, are familiar even to those who have had nothing to do with the group.

The higher power is not just the god of your understanding it is the people in the room Stan, Recovering alcoholic

Countless depictions on film and television have familiarised people with what goes on at the meetings and the familiar formulation ""I'm X and I'm an alcoholic"".

The organisation has its critics. There are those who disagree with the founding idea that alcoholism is a disease, a compulsion that the individual can do nothing about.

Others dislike the Christian nature of the group. The 12 Steps talk of God ""as you understood him"".

Jack Trimpey, who runs his own programme Rational Recovery, is a trenchant critic.

""We do object that it is a bad religion, one in which people profess powerlessness against their bodily desires. We are not powerless. We have a moral duty to cease and desist once it is shown.

""It has been a massive inversion of public thinking that has entered the mainstream media.

""People do feel shame and guilt when they do things that are bad. In AA you learn to be shameless and guiltless.""

He prefers to call himself a former ""bad drunk"" and speaks of an alternative approach that calls for ""zero tolerance in the family"".

Having been sober for many year, he dislikes the typical AA attitude towards that.

""It's not an accomplishment - common decency is no accomplishment.""

Image caption Concerns about binge drinking are now common to much of the world

But for the people at the AA meetings, common decency - and everything else good in life - is an accomplishment.

Jonathan speaks of the single day in 1987 when he first had a moment of happiness. And he knows how it must be maintained.

""I pray and I meditate, and I couple that with working with other alcoholics.""

People at the group seem to have no problem with the varied application of the religious element of AA. There are atheist and agnostic groups, but it's hard to get away from the references to God in the 12 Steps that are at the heart of AA.

The softly-spoken Stan explains: ""The higher power is not just the god of your understanding, it is the people in the room.""

And those other people are the key, one woman admits.

""It works because everything I attempted to do about drinking by myself never worked.

""By coming into AA I was able to get support to not drink - people who think exactly like me, that common bond.""

Alcoholics Anonymous was founded 80 years ago. It has spawned a host of other groups dealing with every manner of compulsion, writes Chris Stokel-Walker.

""My name is Peter and I'm an alcoholic.""

It's a familiar phrase even to those who have never attended a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous. When Peter introduces himself to 40 others in a small room just off Newcastle's main shopping thoroughfare, on a sunny Saturday morning, he receives a warm welcome back in unison.

Everyone here shares a drink dependency, though they come from hugely different walks of life. The format of the meeting is simple - an introduction, a reading, one member explaining their story, then a free-for-all discussion for others to share their concerns, their triumphs, and their thoughts.

Peter began to drink at the age of 11. ""By the age of legal drinking in the UK I was being admitted to local alcoholic units; in and out of doctors; in and out of police cells. Everything in my life really deteriorated."" But Peter hasn't tasted alcohol in 34 years, and he attributes his sobriety to Alcoholics Anonymous.

All members talk about ""working through the 12 steps"" that form the cornerstone of the programme. The first of the steps, published four years after AA began, reads: ""We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable.""

The 12 steps outline a plan of recovery to overcome addiction, which involves submitting to a higher spiritual power and admitting that alcoholism is an ongoing problem. Founded by Bill Wilson and Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio, AA grew out of a Christian organisation - the Oxford Group.

Image copyright ALAMY Image caption The 12-step recovery programme for Narcotics Anonymous are the same for AA

The group is marking 80 years from the moment Wilson helped Smith - 10 June 1935 was the latter's last drink. That social element of AA, the importance of ""sponsors"" in the process, is as well known as any of the steps.

Today, there are 115,326 Alcoholics Anonymous groups in 175 different countries, according to the group's latest estimates, with more than two million members. There are 60,143 groups in the United States alone.

According to a study in 1998, 90% of private substance abuse treatment centres based in the US model their treatment on the 12 steps. The principles have provided a basis for other 12-steps groups with no affiliation to mainstream AA.

THE 12 STEPS

We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable

Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity

Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him

Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves

Admitted to God, to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs

Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character

Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings

Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all

Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others

Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it

Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out

Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs

These include Narcotics Anonymous, the more specific Marijuana Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Workaholics Anonymous and Sexaholics Anonymous.

Clutterers Anonymous deals with those with hoarding problems. Underearners Anonymous offers support for those suffering an ""inability to provide for one's needs"". Support for loved ones of those going through addiction is on offer at Families Anonymous.

On Monday alone there were four Narcotics Anonymous meetings in Manchester, a Marijuana Anonymous meeting in Fitzrovia, central London, and an Overeaters Anonymous session in Cannock. For some of the smaller groups, if there's no dedicated meeting available, addicts are advised to go to AA as a substitute.

Across England, Wales and Scotland, 687 different Alcoholics Anonymous meetings took place on Monday, with 113 chapters coming together in London alone.

""If you look at any 12-step programme, the only significant difference really is the first part of the first step,"" says Peter, who attends AA meetings and organises Emotions Anonymous meetings in the North East of England.

The latter group deals with issues as diverse as low self-esteem, resentment, fear, anger, indecision, perfectionism, forgiveness, depression, grief, shame and anxiety.

""I think there's a fellowship for every particular human condition,"" Peter jokes. ""But I can understand that, because apart from the first part of the first step, the rest of the programme is a programme for living.""

Image copyright Other Image caption AA meeting depicted in the House of Cards

Most fellowships offer Skype sessions, where you'll be greeted in the same way, any hour of the day by welcoming peers always happy to listen, and you'll say the same words: ""My name is… and I'm addicted to …""

""The 12 steps are very applicable to any other addiction,"" says Amy Krentzman of the University of Minnesota's School of Social Work, who has conducted research into Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programmes.

""They modify the language, but it's the same basic programme, the same basic steps, and other people have got well from following them.""

The ""helper"" theory, first coined in the 1960s, helps explain AA's efficacy, says Krentzman. The helper ends up feeling better too. Most, if not all, of those running 12-step groups are themselves undergoing treatment for addiction.

In countless movies and TV shows - from the Sopranos to Mad Men to House of Cards to the West Wing - the sponsor-addict relationship crops up. Sponsors act as a spiritual, emotional and practical guide.

Treatment is always ongoing in AA, unlike some other traditional rehabilitation programmes which offer short programmes followed by the addict coping largely alone.

Marijuana Anonymous has ""exactly the same format"", explains Thomas, a member. ""It has the 12 steps, and various stories that illustrate the practical application of those steps, and stories from people who have gone through the experience and gone sober.""

These spin-off groups are not explicitly endorsed by Alcoholics Anonymous World Services (AAWS), which oversees the organisation's copyrights. But AAWS does grant permission for groups to use the 12 steps.

And AA's principles are still regularly criticised. Some dislike the quasi-religious element, others the emphasis on complete abstinence rather than the possibility of moderate consumption. There's also a new film - The 13th Step - about sexual assaults carried out by AA members on other members.

But perhaps the greatest criticism is from those who want concrete evidence that this widely accepted programme actually produces results.

""The evidence is that it works very well for some people,"" says Krentzman. A review of scientific studies of Alcoholics Anonymous' success in aiding sobriety in 2006 found that ""no experimental studies unequivocally demonstrated the effectiveness of AA"".

Dr Lance Dodes, a former substance abuse treatment specialist, wrote in a book about 12-step programmes that: ""Alcoholics Anonymous was proclaimed the correct treatment for alcoholism over 75 years ago despite the absence of any scientific evidence of the approach's efficacy, and we have been on the wrong path ever since.""

Another bone of contention is that porting across the 12-step programme to other areas offers cultural legitimacy to the idea of a wide range of compulsions as addictive diseases.

Scientists continue to be divided over whether food addiction really exists. They are torn as to whether sex addiction is real or not. It does not, for example, appear in the American Psychiatric Association's list of mental disorders.

But for many, the programme is effective. Krentzman notes: ""It works because of a psychological process, a social process, a spiritual process. Because of the way it gives people a sense of community and knowing other people who have the same problem.""

That's something Jennifer, who attends Overeaters Anonymous, agrees with. She joined the group in 2008, when she was 37 years old and 17-and-a-half stone. Today, she is at a more manageable weight, and attributes that to her ongoing relationship with the fellowship of overeaters.

""When I'd been to therapists and they were telling me to try things, they had no experience of it themselves,"" she says. ""There's something about one addict helping another addict. There was an authenticity to what they were saying.""

""It's a very simple programme for complicated people,"" Thomas says, ""and it seems to withstand a lot of questioning from outside and within, which can't be said for a lot of rehab philosophies.""

In the AA meeting in Newcastle, 40 people sit and share stories of addiction. Aftewards, there are firm handshakes and friendly conversations - smiles and shared jokes.

One by one, they file out the door into the crowds toting shopping bags, looking like anyone else. But in their mind, they carry an extra weight with them throughout the week.

Sir Anthony Hopkins has opened up on his battle with alcoholism, saying he ""should have died in Wales, drunk or something like that"".

The Oscar-winning star admitted he was ""very difficult to work with"" early in his stage career because he ""was usually hungover"".

He said he turned his life around following a talk with a woman from Alcoholics Anonymous in 1975.

Sir Anthony, 80, was born in Port Talbot but now lives in Los Angeles.

Speaking to about 500 students at the University Of California, the Silence Of The Lambs star discussed his problems with alcohol and the impact it had on his early career.

He said: ""Because that's what you do in theatre, you drink. But I was very difficult to work with, as well, because I was usually hungover.""

Sir Anthony added he had been ""disgusted, busted and not to be trusted"" while he was drinking.

The actor told how he started to change following the talk with the Alcoholics Anonymous woman, who asked him ""why don't you just trust in God?"".

From then on the urge to drink was ""never to return"", he added.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sir Anthony - pictured with Dame Diana Rigg in 1972 - said alcohol affected his early career

Sir Anthony, who was knighted in 1993 for services to the arts, said he got into acting ""because he had nothing better to do"", adding he was ""not at all bright"" in school and was often bullied.

""I believe that we are capable of so much,"" he told the students at the 11th annual Leap, Leadership, Excellence and Accelerating Your Potential conference.

""From my own life, I still cannot believe that my life is what it is because I should have died in Wales, drunk or something like that.""

He now lives in Malibu with his actress wife, Stella Arroyave, and advised students to ""say yes to everything. Say yes and take the risk"".

Should there be a word for an 'almost alcoholic'?,"Everybody thinks they know what an ""alcoholic"" is, but what about those who drink too much but fall short of the common definitions of alcoholism?",,None,"Image copyright Thinkstock

Everybody thinks they know what an ""alcoholic"" is, but what about those who drink too much but fall short of the common definitions of alcoholism? Should there be a word that bridges the gap between alcoholic and non-alcoholic?

The term alcoholic - on its own to denote someone addicted to alcohol - was first used in 1852 in the Scottish Temperance Review.

Since then, millions of heavy drinkers have been confronted by friends and families with the stark question: ""Are you an alcoholic?""

And millions have denied it. Rejected the label. Confessed only to maybe, possibly drinking too much. But utterly denied the A-word.

Alcoholics are people who fall asleep in skips. Alcoholics get into fights. Alcoholics start the day with a shot of whisky. Alcoholics are drunk all the time. Alcoholics can't hold down jobs.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Scottish clergyman Rev Thomas Guthrie (centre), an advocate of temperance

None of the above is necessarily true, but the intensely negative nature of the word alcoholic leaves some people scrabbling for an alternative.

""There is so much stigma,"" says Kate, author of the blog The Sober Journalist. People are so frightened of it - their head fills with images of men drinking under bridges. ""There is this huge number of people out there who don't fit that stereotype but perhaps their drinking isn't quite normal.""

Warning signs Image copyright Getty Images In their book Almost Alcoholic, Robert Doyle and Joseph Nowinski identify five signs that someone may be an ""almost alcoholic"": You continue to drink despite at least some negative consequences

You look forward to drinking.

You drink alone.

You sometimes drink in order to control emotional and/or physical symptoms.

You and your loved ones are suffering as a result of your drinking

Kate went to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings when she started to think she was drinking too much, about four or five years ago. ""I felt I was out of place, I wasn't alcoholic enough. I felt that everyone else had worse problems with drinking than I did,"" she says.

There are other words for people who drink a lot. There is everything from the lightly derogatory ""lush"" to the more flowery ""bibulous"" to the prosaic ""heavy drinker"".

But there is nothing as succinct as alcoholic. And some believe that this gap has an effect.

Professionals have started using other terms that would not be as negative as alcoholic because ""many doctors feel that it is quite difficult to engage a patient if you talk to them about alcoholism"", says Dr Sarah Jarvis, a consultant for Patient.co.uk.

People have such vivid mental images of what it means to be an alcoholic that they measure themselves against that standard and do not seek help.

""They all have an idea of what an alcohol or problem drinker is but there is a different pattern for every drinker,"" Jarvis says.

Not all experts share this view, however.

There's a danger that avoiding the term ""alcoholism"" will only serve ""to reassure people their drinking is OK when it isn't"", says Moira Plant, emeritus professor of alcohol studies at the University of the West of England.

Image copyright Hulton Archive Image caption The term inebriate was popular in the 19th Century

She agrees the widespread impression of the alcoholic as a vagrant or street-drinker prevents higher-functioning people with drink problems from seeking help. But she says the best way to tackle this is to correct false stereotypes, not downplay the situation faced by such individuals - many of whom are already in denial.

""People normalise heavy drinking,"" she says. ""They tend to overestimate what everyone else drinks. They say, 'I don't drink as much as my friends so it's OK.'""

There have been other words to describe someone drinking too much. In the 19th Century ""inebriate"" was a popular term and the word ""drunkard"" goes all the way back to the 15th Century.

England's Department of Health recommends that men should not regularly drink more than three to four units of alcohol a day and women should not regularly drink more than two to three units a day.

But drinking above these recommendations does not necessarily mean that the person is an alcoholic. It just means increased risk of health damage.

""An alcoholic is anyone who is dependent on alcohol and who is drinking to a level that will endanger their health,"" Dr Jarvis says.

The term alcoholic is very much alive in the vocabulary of ordinary people, says Tim Leighton, director of professional education and research at Action on Addiction.

""In Europe and in the UK, there was a move away from the term in the 1960s; it was seen as derogatory. We now talk about 'alcohol dependence', but you don't hear people in the street saying he is an 'alcohol dependent,' they say he is an 'alcoholic,'"" he says.

Dr Jarvis says it is a shame the words ""hazardous"" or ""harmful"" drinker aren't used more widely.

The issue with the use of the word ""alcoholic"" is that it is narrow. ""You are either one or you are not,"" Leighton says. ""This is why some people prefer the term 'alcohol dependence'. You can be an alcoholic without drinking too much - it is all about dependence, about losing control.""

For a long time, it was a strict category, there were specific criteria and if you fulfilled these criteria, you were an alcoholic, says Joseph Nowinski, one of the authors of the book Almost Alcoholic.

This is a stage for a lot of controversy - as long as you didn't meet the alcoholic criteria, you would say, ""I am not an alcoholic so I don't have a drinking problem"", he says.

""There has never been a word for people who come to the point of asking themselves the question, 'Do I have a problem or not?'""

Based on this, Nowinski and Robert Doyle came up with the concept of being an ""almost alcoholic"" to describe people who are not alcoholics but who ""fall into a grey area of problem drinking"".

""The almost alcoholic zone is actually quite large. The people who occupy it are not alcoholics. Rather, they are men and women whose drinking habits range from barely qualifying as almost alcoholics to those whose drinking borders on abuse,"" they wrote in the Atlantic.

""An expanded view of drinking behaviour in terms of a spectrum as opposed to discrete categories might be viewed by some as opening the door to over-diagnosing the associated problems. We believe the opposite will prove to be the case: that this paradigm shift will allow people to recognise problems earlier and to seek solutions without having to be labelled as alcoholics.""

""There is a huge range of alcohol problems,"" Leighton says. ""A lot of people with alcohol problems are not alcoholics.""

Until a new label is popularised there will be people who struggle to admit they have a problem, he says.

But for Kate, the existing term has come to make sense as her recovery has progressed.

""I feel that eight months ago I wouldn't have said that I was an alcoholic and now I could say I am because I know what it means,"" she says.

Drunk woman drove from Alcoholics Anonymous meeting,The 41-year-old pleaded guilty to driving while eight times over the drink drive limit.,,2018-02-26T17:01:11+00:00,"A woman has pleaded guilty to being almost eight times the drink drive limit while travelling home from an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in West Lothian.

Louisa Owen, 41, from Bathgate, was seen staggering out of her silver Audi A3 by neighbours who called the police.

She admitted driving with 172mg of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath - 7.8 times the legal limit of 22mg.

Inside an anonymous support group for the children of alcoholics,"Newsbeat has been given rare access to an anonymous support group, Alateen, for children with alcoholic parents.",,None,"Newsbeat has been given rare access to an anonymous support group, Alateen, for children with alcoholic parents.

Self consciousness, feeling alone and feeling different are what's being discussed and could just be considered being part of being a teenager.

But where as most 16-year-olds will have the support of a parent to get them through, these teenagers don't.

It's estimated there a 2.6 million people across the UK dealing with alcoholic parents.

""Other people - they can go home and talk to their parents, who can help them,"" some of the group's members tell Newsbeat.

""But if we have a problem and [our parents] have been drinking they're not going to be fully there for us.

""They might be aggressive, they might be silent, they might not want to talk to us at all.""

We're gathered in a small room above a church hall. It's cold so we've all kept our coats on.

Here people discuss the feelings most of us have learned to hide.

Whoever is holding a Little Miss Chatterbox soft toy gets to talk.

Everyone's head nods when the topic of fake smiles comes up.

""I try not to fake smile any more,"" someone says. ""It's exhausting. It happens because I'm afraid other people won't understand.""

""It's been a bad week emotionally for me,"" someone else says.

""More things happened with my dad and brother.""

I get the feeling this is an update on something everyone here knows all about.

As Little Miss Chatterbox continues to be passed around we hear how ""my step-mom is still a bitch"" and ""I feel like I've lost my mum"".

But no-one seems shocked.

Although they've all had different experiences, they share common emotions.

Sadness is one of the main topics of this week's meeting - the other is peace of mind.

(We discuss sadness first because it's good to finish on the more positive topic, someone says.)

One girl explains how she's still battling depression.

In fact, she's adamant she ""wouldn't still be here"" were it not for Alateen meetings.

Just like Alcoholics Anonymous, which helps alcoholics recover, Alateen thrives on anonymity.

It makes people feel safe.

There's an echo of chatter coming from another meeting downstairs.

That meeting is an Al-Anon meeting, which helps slightly older relatives of alcoholics.

Alcoholism ""is a family disease because it affects all the members emotionally and sometimes physically,"" according to a page of instructions read out at the start of each meeting.

The group is also reminded weekly that ""everything that is said here must be held in confidence.""

As I watch the group interact it's clear to me they trust each other totally.

They also seem to genuinely like each other - there are jokes and as someone wells up, she's given a hug.

Suddenly, Little Miss Chatterbox is placed in front of me.

I thought I'd only be watching this evening but I get the feeling if I refuse to take part I'll somehow ruin the atmosphere.

So I share my thoughts of sadness and I'm surprised by how it feels.

The group listen to me intently. I don't get the feeling they are faking an interest or just being polite.

For a moment I forget about the job I'm here to do and open up.

It's a nice feeling - a mixture of nerves, adrenaline and feeling special.

As I talk I spot a card on the table in front of me. It's the Alcoholics Anonymous ""serenity prayer"".

God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,

Courage to change the things I can,

And wisdom to know the difference.

""Although we cannot change or control our parents, we can detach from their problems while continuing to love them,"" which is another quote from the group's instructions.

It's almost half nine, the meeting has run over a little (mainly because of my questions) and instead of feeling tired, I'm feeling uplifted.

Lynne who organises the group gives me a hug goodbye.

I think it's a sign of how emotional everyone is.

I take out my phone and call a friend but I struggle to explain how I'm feeling.

Perhaps that's the power of these groups, you have to go to understand.

Written by Pete Jackson and inspired by his own road to recovery. Stars Rebecca Front, John Hannah, Sue Johnston, Paul Kaye and Johnny Vegas.

Love in Recovery follows the lives of five very different recovering alcoholics. Johnny Vegas is Andy, the sweet but simple self-appointed group leader. Sue Johnston plays straight talking Julie, who's been known to have the odd relapse here and there - and everywhere. Rebecca Front is the snobby and spiky Fiona, an ex-banker who had it all and then lost the lot. John Hannah is Simon, a snide journalist who’s not an alcoholic – he got caught drink driving, his boss made him attend the meeting, but he fell in love with Fiona and stayed. And, despite her best efforts, she fell in love with him too. Paul Kaye is Danno, a down and out two-bit chancer with a shady past but a lot of heart, who’s desperate to turn his life around.

As we follow their weekly meetings, we hear them moan, argue, laugh, fall apart, fall in love and, most importantly, tell their stories.

In this second episode, Julie has a bone to pick with Danno, and Andy has finally met a woman – but she’s not all she seems.

With more than two million members worldwide, AA is still considered by the majority to be the most effective rehabilitation treatment available to alcoholics. In an age of heavily commercialised recovery programmes, ""The Fellowship"" continues to work with no active promotion and a consciously anarchistic and non-commercial structure.

Through conversations with AA members, their partners, parents and children in Al-Anon and Alateen, AL Kennedy explores the method and treatment of the organisation, along with the story of its foundation and survival.

With statistics showing alcohol consumption in the UK on the rise in contrast with the rest of Europe, she asks whether AA is still the best 'cure' for addicts given new science and treatments.

UK Punjabi alcohol support services 'see rise in users',The reports follow a BBC survey suggesting 27% of British Sikhs have a family member with a problem.,,None,"Image copyright Vik Kainth

Some ethnic minority alcohol support services have seen an increase in inquiries following a BBC survey suggesting that, despite Sikhism forbidding drinking, 27% of UK Sikhs had a family member with a problem.

They reported a rise in contacts from both alcoholics and volunteers.

Nottingham's Bac-In has seen an almost sixfold increase in website hits.

And UK Punjabi services the First Step Foundation and the Shanti Project have also seen an increase in interest.

Sohan Sahota, of Bac-In said: ""Average website hits are around 2,000 a month. We've had over 11,500 hits since the article.""

Jaz Rai, director of the First Step Foundation, which works with UK Punjabis across England, said it had doubled the size of its weekly support group and was planning a women-only meeting to address the increased demand.

The Shanti Project, which works to provide culturally appropriate services for the Punjabi community in Birmingham, has also seen an increase.

Tina, a British Punjabi mother-of-two, contacted the BBC after reading its coverage of the issue.

The reports resonated very strongly with her own experiences, she said.

Her husband - a heavy drinker - had been emotionally abusive towards her, Tina said, trying to convince her that she was going mad, and taking out loans in her name to finance his drinking after losing his job as a plumber.

""There's so much going on in Asian families that no-one addresses,"" she said. ""I just want our culture to open up.

""People need to wake up and realise that alcohol is poison,"" she said. ""I don't want my kids to go through what I went through. I don't want my daughter to think that it's normal.""

Image copyright Vik Kainth

Sharing stories about addiction can play a key role in the path to recovery, according to Alcoholics Anonymous.

Recovering alcoholic Sanjay Bhandari told the BBC: ""The thing that resonated most with me was to hear other people's stories.

""What they experienced, what it was like, and how things got better gave me hope and inspiration, 'Well I can do that.'""

The BBC's coverage sparked a discussion on social media, involving Sikh MPs, support services, and people directly affected by the issue.

Talking about the issue openly was a good first step towards challenging cultural norms and tackling the problem head on, said Jasvir Singh, on BBC Radio 4's Thought for the Day programme.

""To overcome any fear of shame, it's important to look at alcohol misuse as a health condition and treat it with empathy and understanding rather than condemnation and judgement of the person or their family.""

The Spiritual Approach To Addiction



Programmes to help drug and alcohol addicts abstain from addictive substances are more effective if they have a 'spiritual component', according to researchers in the United States.



A study of how recovering addicts fared a year after treatment has found that spiritual programmes, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, were more effective than treatment in a hospital clinic. BBC Science reports.



Recovery Programmes

Addiction recovery programmes like Alcoholics Anonymous emphasise a 'spiritual approach' to recovery from addiction.



The Stanford University study found that recovering addicts were more likely to abstain from drugs and alcohol if they were attending a spiritually oriented programme, like Alcoholics Anonymous, than if they were attending a hospital outpatients' clinic.



Spiritual And Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy

Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) was founded in the 1930s, and its 12-step programme encourages members to turn to God or a Higher Power for help in overcoming addiction. Whilst the group does not keep official membership lists, it estimates that there are currently 99,020 groups in operation across the world, with a total membership of 1,995,804.



Clinical treatment, on the other hand, emphasises cognitive skills training and psychotherapy. With a scientific focus, patients rely more heavily on professional counselling services that are likely to deal with teaching people how to deal with situations that may lead to drinking and how to cope with the negativity of alcoholism.



The study found that people attending meetings styled on the AA approach were more likely to be abstaining from drugs or alcohol a year after first seeking help, compared to addicts who were given clinical treatment.



Dr Keith Humphreys, professor of psychiatry at The Stanford University School of Medicine, California, and leader of the research, says spiritual programmes have been widely criticised for not being based on medical science. But, he says, these programmes are just as effective as hospital-based treatment and could in fact be cheaper than conventional medicine.



Support Groups

Whilst Dr Humpreys identified that the costs and length of treatment were comparable, the focus of the study examined the care provided in the year after discharge from inpatient treatment, when costs are very different.



'The study showed that the faith-based approach significantly lowers post-treatment costs by about two-thirds.'

Groups such as AA and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) encourage their members to rely on their support groups, as opposed to doctors, after leaving hospital.



The study suggests that in making connections with other people who have been through similar situations and treatment, individuals are more likely to abstain from drink and drugs and consequently reduce the chances of hospitalisation and costly psychiatric treatment.



Speaking on the cost saving benefits of the spiritually orientated programmes, Dr Humphreys has commented:



'We, as a society, are fortunate to have a developed system of self help organisations that do not cost the taxpayer or the health-care system a dime.'



'Organisations like AA not only reduce human misery, they also take a big burden off of our increasingly resource-strapped health care system. Hence it is important for health care professionals to learn about these organisations and develop connections with them.'



Addiction recovery programmes like Alcoholics Anonymous emphasise a 'spiritual approach' to recovery from addiction.The Stanford University study found that recovering addicts were more likely to abstain from drugs and alcohol if they were attending a spiritually oriented programme, like Alcoholics Anonymous, than if they were attending a hospital outpatients' clinic.Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) was founded in the 1930s, and its 12-step programme encourages members to turn to God or a Higher Power for help in overcoming addiction. Whilst the group does not keep official membership lists, it estimates that there are currently 99,020 groups in operation across the world, with a total membership of 1,995,804.Clinical treatment, on the other hand, emphasises cognitive skills training and psychotherapy. With a scientific focus, patients rely more heavily on professional counselling services that are likely to deal with teaching people how to deal with situations that may lead to drinking and how to cope with the negativity of alcoholism.The study found that people attending meetings styled on the AA approach were more likely to be abstaining from drugs or alcohol a year after first seeking help, compared to addicts who were given clinical treatment.Dr Keith Humphreys, professor of psychiatry at The Stanford University School of Medicine, California, and leader of the research, says spiritual programmes have been widely criticised for not being based on medical science. But, he says, these programmes are just as effective as hospital-based treatment and could in fact be cheaper than conventional medicine.Whilst Dr Humpreys identified that the costs and length of treatment were comparable, the focus of the study examined the care provided in the year after discharge from inpatient treatment, when costs are very different.Groups such as AA and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) encourage their members to rely on their support groups, as opposed to doctors, after leaving hospital.The study suggests that in making connections with other people who have been through similar situations and treatment, individuals are more likely to abstain from drink and drugs and consequently reduce the chances of hospitalisation and costly psychiatric treatment.Speaking on the cost saving benefits of the spiritually orientated programmes, Dr Humphreys has commented:'We, as a society, are fortunate to have a developed system of self help organisations that do not cost the taxpayer or the health-care system a dime.''Organisations like AA not only reduce human misery, they also take a big burden off of our increasingly resource-strapped health care system.

12-Steps To Recovery At the heart of the Alcoholics Anonymous programme are the following 12-steps to recovery:



1 We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable.



2 Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.



3 Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God, as we understood Him.



4 Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.



5 Admitted to God, to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.



6 Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.



7 Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.



8 Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.



9 Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.



10 Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.



11 Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.



12 Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs.

Recovery movement helps addicts kick the habit in Liverpool,"How former addicts in Liverpool are trying a new programme to kick the habit, as figures show deaths from alcohol are on the increase.",,None,"Image caption Addicts on the Recovery programme are hoping to kick the habit for good

""Ah boom chikka boom!"" sings the choir leader. ""Ah boom chikka boom! "" sing back the twenty or so members of the choir.

The Raucous Caucus Recovery Chorus is made up mainly of former drug users and alcoholics from Liverpool.

They rehearse in a small room at an addiction charity office and you have to be sober to sing: all members pledge that they've been off drink or drugs for at least 24 hours.

Being in the choir is part of the treatment for these former users, doing something normal like singing with other people.

But the choir has a wider significance as the public face of a new programme in tackling addiction called Recovery - a movement in which Liverpool is playing a leading role.

Rather than manage an addiction with drug substitutes or controlled drinking, people go through detox and then practise total abstinence.

'Animal existence'

Drink-related deaths in the North West are among the highest with men accounting for two-thirds of such deaths in the UK.

And figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the problem is getting worse.

In the Land of Recovery, it's the guinea pigs that wear the white coats. Mark Gilman , NHS Treatment Agency

More people in the UK died from alcohol-related conditions in 2010 than in 2009 with the figure rising by 126 to 8,790 from 8,664.

But to understand why Liverpool is leading the way in this new idea, we need to go back in time.

In the 1980s, it was one of the cities to bear the brunt of a new drug problem - the arrival of brown powder heroin.

Addicts stole to feed their cravings, and transmitted HIV and other infections by using dirty needles.

To cut crime and improve health, Liverpool was one of the first places to pioneer harm reduction treatments.

Users were prescribed methadone to keep them off heroin. It worked, but many people spent years on methadone, and remained addicts.

Raucous Caucus singer Colin used drugs for 22 years, and was on methadone for 17.

""I'd have done anything for my drugs."" he said. ""I lived an animal existence.""

Now, being in the choir is vital for him.

""I love it,"" he said. ""It's really positive for me.""

Children of addicts

The idea of Recovery, of staying off drink and drugs for good, has been around for some time.

Image caption Former addict Colin has been off drugs for two years thanks to the Recovery programme

It started in America, but is now taking hold in the UK.

Liverpool is still a relatively poor city with high unemployment and poor housing which partly explains why drug and drink addiction is so high; there are twelve Alcoholics Anonymous meetings here every week.

It also explains why Liverpool is at the forefront of the movement in England.

Jacquie Johnston-Lynch, of Action on Addiction, said: ""Liverpool has the highest number of [Recovery] Fellowships per head of population in Europe.""

Liverpool was where the UK's first Recovery March took place in 2009 and Action on Addiction has opened an alcohol-free bar called The Brink.

But the idea of ""Recovery"" has sparked furious debate in drug treatment circles.

Some don't like the idea of users taking more responsibility for their own treatment.

Mark Gilman, leader of the NHS Treatment Agency, said: ""In the Land of Recovery, it's the guinea pigs that wear the white coats.""

But Martin says Recovery is important because it could put an end to the problem where the children of addicts become addicts themselves.

""If you get this right, you're the firewall between the intergenerational transfer of addiction,"" he said.

""It sounds grand, but that's the prize on offer.""","['helps', 'kick', 'recovery', 'habit', 'choir', 'addicts', 'drugs', 'users', 'treatment', 'addiction', 'boom', 'drug', 'idea', 'liverpool', 'movement']","Image caption Addicts on the Recovery programme are hoping to kick the habit for good""Ah boom chikka boom!""

Eminem celebrates a decade of being sober,The rapper has been clean since the end of 2007.,,2018-04-23T09:59:57+00:00,"Image copyright Getty Images

Eminem has revealed he's been sober for ten years.

On Saturday, in between headlining Coachella, he posted a photo of himself with an Alcoholics Anonymous coin which signifies sobriety.

""Celebrated my 10 years yesterday,"" the rapper wrote on Instagram - which received more than 1.6 million likes.

Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, was addicted to prescription medication and nearly died of an accidental methadone overdose in 2007.

At the height of his addiction the rapper was reportedly taking up to 20 pills a day.

The 8 Mile actor credits his children for helping him recover and previously revealed he replaced addiction with exercise.

The 45-year-old said running and working out was key to giving him endorphins, which also meant he managed to sleep.

People tweeted him messages of congratulations, including rapper Royce Da 59.

AA: America's Gift to the World,"AL Kennedy's new Radio 4 documentary - AA: America's Gift to the World - tells the story of Alcoholics Anonymous and its methods, and asks whether AA is still the best 'cure' for addicts given new science and treatments.",,2015-04-01T13:36:32+00:00,"AL Kennedy's new Radio 4 documentary - America's Gift to the World - tells the story of Alcoholics Anonymous and its methods, and asks whether AA is still the best 'cure' for addicts given new science and treatments. This is the background to the story, and how the making of the programme impacted on its presenter.

The initials AA are peripherally familiar to many, as is perhaps the name Alcoholics Anonymous. Nevertheless, I think a lot of people don’t know much about AA or the story of its creation – when Bill Wilson, an alcoholic wall street trader with a big idea about staying sober, met an alcoholic doctor, Bob Smith. They talked and understood each other, helped each other get sober and worked out a way they could pass that on. I’ve seen friends ruin their own lives and those of all around them through dysfunctional drinking: the idea of two people finding a way to unravel that nightmare is truly beautiful and fascinating.

AA’s desire to preserve its members' privacy and to make no grand statements on issues, meant we had to be sensitive about interviews. It’s also probably one reason why AA isn’t well-known outside its membership. AA’s also an intentionally disorganised organisation. I loved looking at a huge association which seems to do exactly what it intends and yet which is specifically engineered to concentrate power and responsibility downwards and to avoid creating authority figures, funding drives, advertising drives and so forth. It seems to reverse modern thinking about success, but has millions of members, has lasted 80 years and still rolls on.

With so many products and experiences now designed to exert an addictive or pseudo-addictive influence, I suppose AA pushes against some powerful trends in society. As was pointed out during my research, alcohol use is central to many of our social occasions, celebrations, even some religious ceremonies. Anyone trying to stay away from drink isn’t going to have it easy. AA isn’t for everyone, but it seems to work very well for those who do use it.

What I was struck by most of all was the generosity, honesty and compassion of all our contributors. We have hours of wonderful stories and insights that we just couldn’t fit into the programme. The professionals we spoke to were genuinely passionate about trying to understand alcoholism and help alcoholics to recover. AA members were searingly frank about themselves – and very funny - and really had a grip on who they were and how they could meet the world. We also interviewed Al-Anon and Alateen members – those affected by the drinking of others. Their experiences and bravery were startling, humbling. It was really a privilege to meet them all.

The unspoken alcohol problem among UK Punjabis,Alcohol consumption is glamorised across different aspects of Punjabi culture and shame stops many seeking the help that they need.,,None,"Image copyright Vik Kainth

For many British Punjabis, alcohol abuse is an open secret. Alcohol consumption is glamorised across different aspects of Punjabi culture and shame stops many seeking the help that they need.

Harjinder read her daughter Jaspreet one last bedtime story, then kissed her goodnight. She was exhausted after a long day, and drifted off next to her daughter. Her toddler son was already asleep in the next room.

The next thing she remembers is her husband yelling. He was drunk and furious that when he returned from the pub she wasn't in their marital bed. In a rage, he flipped the child's bed throwing his wife and daughter to the floor. Harjinder hit the radiator hard with Jaspreet landing on top of her.

Incidents like this were a regular feature of Jaspreet and her brother Hardeep's childhood. ""It was heartbreaking,"" Jaspreet says.

So when Harjinder found Hardeep, now aged 16, drinking whisky in his room after an argument with his alcoholic dad, she was terrified that he was following in his father's footsteps.

There are around 430,000 Sikhs in the UK, making up a significant proportion of the British Punjabi population. Harjinder herself is Sikh and amongst her community her experience isn't unique.

A new survey, commissioned by the BBC to investigate attitudes to alcohol among British Sikhs, found that - although drinking alcohol is forbidden in Sikhism - 27% of British Sikhs report having someone in their family with an alcohol problem. It's a problem which is rarely talked about openly in the community.

More than 1,000 British Sikhs responded to the survey - find out more using this interactive tool:

Harjinder moved in with her husband's family after their arranged marriage - both common practices within Punjabi and wider South Asian communities. She was shocked to find out how much her newly acquired family's social life centred around the men's excessive drinking.

The family, along with young children, would go to a friend's house and would stay there until two or three o'clock in the morning waiting for the men, and she started to feel increasingly isolated.

Rav Sekhon, a British Punjabi psychotherapist who works with ethnic minority communities, says: ""There is really strong pride and honour for the family name. They don't want anyone to perceive them as having something wrong with them or any form of weakness.""

Sanjay Bhandari is from a Hindu Punjabi family, a partner at a multinational city firm in London and a recovering alcoholic. After his father died when he was 15, he says he started drinking and never really stopped.

By his mid 30s, he realised that he hadn't been a single day without a drink for over seven years, and he'd been dependent on alcohol for much longer. He says his Punjabi background played a big part in discouraging him from admitting he had a problem.

Sanjay, who has been sober for 16 years, says he didn't feel that he could admit he had a weakness, nor that he was feeling lonely and self-medicating with alcohol. He didn't look to the Punjabi community for help, but eventually found Alcoholics Anonymous.

""It would never have occurred to me to go to the community for help with drinking. It was almost the last place I would have gone.""

When the first immigrants, who were mostly men, came to the UK from Punjab in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, many found themselves struggling to assimilate being in a new country, often working long hours to send money home to their families.

The stresses of moving to a new culture, the associated language barriers and the racism they faced meant many of these men turned to alcohol to cope. This reliance on alcohol has had generational repercussions.

Jennifer Shergill, an alcohol practitioner from the West Midlands, works with Sikh men and women to manage and overcome addiction. She points to the combination of British binge drinking and the culture of drinking in Punjab, which together create a perfect storm for some of the people accessing support services.

For Harjinder, her husband's heavy drinking had worsening consequences. Although he was becoming increasingly violent towards her, she was still reluctant to seek help.

She says his behaviour was normalised by his family, leaving her feeling almost brainwashed by them into hopelessly accepting the situation. It wasn't until she went to her GP with injuries from the abuse that she realised that what she was experiencing wasn't normal.

Eventually Harjinder called the police and she and her children moved out of the family home to stay with her parents. Even then her husband didn't acknowledge the impact that his drinking was having.

""I think [my husband] knew deep down that what he was doing was wrong but it was almost as if his male pride couldn't admit it.""

Jennifer Shergill thinks one of the barriers for people seeking help is the fear of someone finding out. ""There is stigma associated with chronic alcohol misuse and they don't want their reputation to be tainted... if there is a dependent drinker in the family what might people think of our family?""

The Shanti Project, where Jennifer works, is just one scheme working to tackle this stigma and to provide culturally appropriate services for the Punjabi community in Birmingham.

Others include a volunteer-led Sikh Helpline, the Derby Recovery Network, BAC-IN, and First Step Foundation, which are all doing their part to help tackle alcoholism in a culturally sensitive way.

The Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute Harjinder's husband due to a lack of evidence and, six weeks later, Harjinder and her children returned to the home she shared with her husband.

Her husband's family had visited her to assure her he had stopped drinking and things would be different - so feeling the pressure from both his family and her own, she and her children returned home.

But Harjinder struggled with depression. Her husband hadn't stopped drinking. It was at this point that - prompted by a community psychiatric nurse - she started talking to a counsellor. ""I felt quite desperate at times,"" she says, ""but the counselling really helped, I felt that I could carry on.""

Harjinder is still living with her husband after more than 20 years of marriage, but their lives are very separate now. Her daughter, now in her 20s, constantly urges her to leave him.

""I've thought about it a lot. A part of me thinks, why bother at this age? But then another part of me thinks: well, if I've got another 20 years of this, that's not good. I think it could happen.""

Harjinder and her family members' names have been changed.

Alcohol consumption is glamorised across different aspects of Punjabi culture and shame stops many seeking the help that they need.
There are around 430,000 Sikhs in the UK, making up a significant proportion of the British Punjabi population.
A new survey, commissioned by the BBC to investigate attitudes to alcohol among British Sikhs, found that - although drinking alcohol is forbidden in Sikhism - 27% of British Sikhs report having someone in their family with an alcohol problem.

Russia: Government mobile app to help alcoholics,New government app aims to help recovering alcoholics and drug addicts.,,None,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Russia has one of the highest alcohol-related mortality rates in the world

The Russian government is trying to tackle the country's notoriously high alcoholism rate with the launch of a free mobile app.

The app will provide information for ""people battling addictions that are very hard to fight"" in order to help them to stay clean, says Yevgeny Bryun, the health ministry's leading narcotics official. He tells the M24 news website that it will offer details of nearby support meetings for recovering alcoholics and drug addicts, medical advice on keeping the problem under control, and access to online radio programmes run by Alcoholics Anonymous.

The app should be up and running next year, but Mr Bryun says other resources are already being made available, including a new radio network for rehabilitation clinics, where ""specialists and alcoholics will talk about recovering"".

Experts are lining up in support of the plan, which they see as a serious attempt to tackle what Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has called Russia's drinking-culture ""national disaster"". ""Information technology can play a very important role here, as you can't change these patients with pills,"" Dr Oleg Zykov, a leading Moscow drugs specialist, tells M24.

Russian men are estimated to drink about 70% more pure alcohol than their American counterparts, and United Nations figures suggest alcohol was the main culprit in 30% of all deaths in Russia in 2012. Government incentives, penalties and price hikes seem to be making little difference. But the ideas keep on coming. In Moscow, a pilot scheme will see the city's health department issue certificates to people who stay clean, and the head of Russia's anti-drugs service has even suggested devoting a television channel to helping people beat their addictions.

Devon SMART Recovery groups for addicts to expand,A group which offers science-based support for addicts plans to expand its service in Devon.,,None,"Image caption There are 80 SMART recovery groups in the UK and about 650 worldwide

A group which offers science-based support for people with alcohol, drug and gambling addictions plans to expand its service in Devon.

Self Management and Recovery Training (SMART) uses motivational, behavioural and cognitive methods.

The NHS Devon Drug and Alcohol Action Team is spending £4,000 to help it form more groups in the county.

SMART Recovery currently has seven groups and hopes to open a further 10 in the next two years.

The organisation said it gives people alternatives to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA).

'Addictive behaviour'

SMART Recovery uses a four-step plan which helps participants decide whether they have a problem, builds up their motivation to change and offers a set of techniques to support recovery, a spokesperson said.

Richard Phillips, director of SMART Recovery, said: ""We have evidence that all the individual techniques work.

""Clearly AA and NA work very well for some people, for other people SMART Recovery might work better.

""Our approach is very much to place the responsibility of change within the individual, they've got the ability to choose to change their addictive behaviour.""

Kristian Tomblin, from the Devon Drug and Alcohol Action Team, said it was important to have a range of services in place to accommodate different needs.

Mr Phillips said there was 650 groups worldwide with 80 in the UK.

Pakistan battles growing alcohol addiction,"Alcoholism is a growing problem in Pakistan despite it being illegal for the Muslim majority to drink, reports the BBC's Charles Haviland.",,None,"Image caption Pakistan is supposed to be officially ""dry"" because of its Muslim majority

Alcoholism is a growing problem in Pakistan despite it being illegal for the Muslim majority to drink. The BBC's Charles Haviland finds lives ruined and clinics and therapy groups trying to overcome a taboo subject.

Late one night, the beat of dance music drifts down from an upper storey of an apartment block on the edge of a Pakistani city.

Inside the flat, the music is pulsating around a dance floor. There is a bar where a range of liquor is being served and cocktails shaken. Under flashing stroboscopic lights, dozens of people laugh, dance and enjoy the drink.

This is one of the parties that are now commonplace in the cities but are highly discreet.

The liquor is bought illicitly from bootleggers - or from the regular alcohol shops that are supposed to sell only to minorities holding permits but also sell illegally to large numbers of Muslims.

Pakistan even has its own breweries which officially produce only for non-Muslims - or for export.

'Increasing trend'

Image caption Mr Ahmed was formerly an alcoholic and now runs a rehabilitation organisation

The subculture of liquor enjoyment belies Pakistan's status as officially ""dry"". That is, the 96% of Pakistanis who, according to official figures are Muslim, are not supposed to drink.

The penalty if they do so is 80 lashes but it is not strictly enforced.

Although there are many harmless social gatherings, there is also a growing problem of addiction to the bottle.

Officials have told the BBC - while not wanting to be quoted - that alcohol-related diseases have risen by at least 10% in the past five years.

Tahir Ahmed, a former alcoholic who now runs a rehabilitation organisation, Therapy Works, detects ""a visibly increasing trend"". Six years ago, when he started this work, most drinkers were in at least their 20s; now, some are as young as 14, he says.

I would wake up and I would not remember the last two or three days of my life because I was so intoxicated - and that really frightened me Sara, Alcoholic in Lahore

Sometimes alcohol is taken in conjunction with narcotics.

He says alcohol has a much firmer presence in the home - especially for the affluent - and at social occasions like weddings.

And he says that if a Pakistani drinks, it is usually in large quantities because it is, he believes, a response to the massive social pressures here, including the threat of political violence and high unemployment.

""Unfortunately drinking in Pakistan is not recreational,"" he said. ""It's much more escapist and much more relief-seeking. That means drink till the bottle is emptied.""

Now 65, this is the way he himself used to be. He watched two of his friends die of cirrhosis of the liver and nearly died himself.

He decided to stop drinking but went into clinical depression for a year. Only then did he receive therapy, later setting up his organisation, which is registered with Britain's Counselling and Psychotherapy Central Awarding Body.

'Taboo for women'

Drinking among the affluent is especially noticeable. Some senior politicians are rumoured to drink, and alcohol is served at some high-society events, though never on camera.

But it affects everybody. Last month, at least 12 people in Karachi died after drinking toxic home-made liquor.

Some Pakistani alcoholics are women. For them, the stigma is all the greater.

In Pakistan's second city, Lahore, Sara - whose name we have changed - recounts her story.

Five years ago, aged 33 and with two teenage children, she got divorced. Then alcoholism just sucked her in. She would go binge-drinking for days at a time and suffer blackouts.

""I would wake up and I would not remember the last two or three days of my life because I was so intoxicated. And that really frightened me.""

Image caption Mr Umer said a strict and austere regimen helped him overcome drinking

As word got around and she became an embarrassment to her children, Sara wanted to go to a rehabilitation clinic. But being a woman made this very difficult in Pakistan.

""Some men will turn around and say, 'Okay, I have a problem.' But it's a taboo for women. A woman will never stand up and say I have a problem and I need help. That's not acceptable.""

Nine months ago, she finally sought assistance and was able to get medicine and therapy-based help at home, from Therapy Works. Now she is recovering.

In an unregulated medical market, there are other clinics whose approach to treatment is much more strict. The BBC visited one in Karachi, called Willing Ways, where a group of current and former residents were in a session with the doctor who founded the establishment.

Clients are admitted with their families' consent, but they do not always realise they will be confined for three months. While living there, they are deprived of all addictive substances including tobacco, and of all external communications.

One former patient contacted the BBC and said he felt the set-up was excessively draconian.

But a satisfied former client, businessman Yousuf Umer, says the austere regimen worked for him.

""It has changed my life and I am a very successful man now.""

'I'm listening'

Image caption Dr Mamsa, right, conducts a radio show using a mix of English and Urdu

While clinics and therapy-based groups tackle alcoholism, the media is now doing so too.

On Karachi's Radio 1 91 FM a psychiatrist-broadcaster, Dr Faisal Mamsa, takes calls every Thursday and Friday night on all sorts of social taboos - including this one.

""Go ahead. I'm listening,"" he tells callers in soft tones. Sporting a mop of unruly hair and a beard, he wears shorts in the studio.

There follows a conversation in a mix of English and Urdu.

Calls or texts from affected family members are encouraged. A woman says her husband has been drinking for 13 years but she cannot persuade him to seek help. The doctor suggests they contact Alcoholics Anonymous.

The next caller is an addict who admits he is violent.

Dr Mamsa says the anonymity of radio makes it ideal for this subject.

""I'm not concerned about the name,"" he said.

""If they're talking about a problem, it's not just them who's benefiting out of it but whosoever is listening to the radio is listening about it. What matters is that the problem is being discussed.""

There is no chance of Pakistan's legally ""dry"" status changing in the near future. Yet there is an alcoholism problem, which officials and doctors say is growing.

Writer Pete Jackson is a recovering alcoholic and has spent time in Alcoholics Anonymous. It was there he found support from the unlikeliest group of disparate souls - with one common bond. As well as offering the support he needed throughout a difficult time, AA also offered a weekly, sometimes daily, dose of hilarity, upset, heartbreak and friendship.

There are lots of different kinds of AA meetings. Love in Recovery is about meetings where people tell their stories. There are funny stories, sad stories, stories of small victories and milestones, stories of loss, stories of hope, and those stories that you really shouldn't laugh at - but still do, along with the storyteller.

"'So drunk my daughter, 12, made my meals'","As more women are treated for drink problems, one mother tells how her evening glass of wine turned into full-blown alcoholism.",,2016-11-17T11:44:15+00:00,"Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Women's alcohol consumption is catching up with men

""My daughter told me she didn't like the fact that I always smelt of wine. That was probably the point I thought I may have a problem.""

What started as a few glasses of wine in the evening with her husband quickly developed into full-blown alcoholism for Alice, a mother of one from Birmingham.

She's one of a growing number of women dealing with a drink problem, with recent statistics showing women are nearing equality with men in alcohol consumption.

But as the shame of her addiction eventually forced her to seek help, she found several barriers in her way as a woman and mother seeking treatment.

Her problems with alcohol started at the age of 33 when she married and had a child.

""My then husband used to like popping to the local for one or two drinks before bed. Once our child was born this led onto opening a bottle of wine each evening and this is when the pattern started.

""Over the years it went from sharing one bottle to sharing two-plus. Then it moved to having a drink as soon as I got home from work about 4pm.""

Need help or support?

Need help or support?

Her marriage eventually broke down, and Alice sought more comfort from the bottle.

Alcohol was no longer a treat in the home, but became part of her daily routine, regularly drinking alone. She didn't see as dangerous at the time.

""We hear horror stories of binge drinking but not about the middle class consumption of wine or a gin and tonic in the evening.

""When I grew up men went out to the pub and drank, women less so because alcohol was not generally available in the home except for special occasions. Things have equalised.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alice said Alcoholics Anonymous meetings were too 'male dominated'

Alice was signed off work with depression whilst dealing with her divorce, and after a day of drinking would often be inebriated by the time her daughter came home from school.

Her daughter often had to do the household chores she was unable to complete. ""She made tea on a number of occasions,"" recalls Alice.

""I had taken an 'overdose' on a couple of occasions - never serious attempts just feeling drunk and wretched. My daughter was about 12 at the time and she was becoming increasingly fearful about how much I was drinking.""

This, combined with GP blood tests, made her realise how much damage she was doing to herself and those around her.

Alice initially tried to seek help at AA meetings, but struggled with their 'male dominated' environment and could never find childcare for her daughter.

""There needs to be women only groups and support groups to help with childcare so they can attend appointments and meetings.""

""I think that women, especially single women, have more of an issue because they fear social service involvement and losing their children"".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alcohol related problems are increasing amongst women

After finding AA unsuccessful, she was referred to a support worker from the charity Change, Grow, Live who helped her with recovery on an individual basis near her home in Birmingham. They helped Alice set goals to help her see beyond drinking.

""One of the goals I set in early recovery was to join a choir, which I am still enjoying. I have now had a whole raft of excellent experiences.""

Knowing the risks

Defeating alcoholism also made Alice find some compromises in her life, which involved stepping back from career aspirations to focus on her family.

""I don't need to overdo it by working full-time. I spend more, and less stressful, time with the kids.""

The theme of Alcohol Awareness Week 2016 , which ends on 20 November, is ""knowing the risks"" - getting people thinking about why they drink, and ""how it affects us as individuals, families, communities and society as a whole.""

Sian Warmer, head of services at CGL, the charity that helped Alice, says they help people identify why they are turning to drink.

""The reasons people use substances, whether they are drugs or alcohol, are endless and often very unique to the individual.

""We recognise that these people may have complex needs, involving things such as domestic violence, pregnancy, mental health and sex work.""","['image', 'helped', 'meals', 'alcohol', 'alice', 'wine', 'work', 'occasions', 'women', 'drunk', 'help', 'daughter', '12']","Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Women's alcohol consumption is catching up with men""My daughter told me she didn't like the fact that I always smelt of wine.

Alcohol dependency: When social drinking becomes a problem,"Alcohol-related health issues among baby boomers are on the rise. Daily drinking can start off as a social event, but turn into dependency and addiction, experts say.",,None,"Alcohol-related health issues among baby boomers are on the rise. Daily drinking can start off as a social event but turn into dependency, addiction experts say. So when does social drinking become alcoholism?

In the festive season, with office parties, Christmas, and new year, there is opportunity aplenty for yet another tipple.

Since the 1950s, alcohol consumption in the UK has gradually increased. The NHS now spends more on alcohol-related illness among baby boomers than any other age group, with £825m spent on 55 to 74-year-olds in 2010-11 compared to £64m on under-24s.

Alcohol addiction When someone becomes dependent or addicted to alcohol, they: Develop a strong sense of compulsion to drink

May drink shortly after waking to reduce feelings of alcohol withdrawal

Develop a reduced capacity to control how often and how much they drink

Organise their lifestyle around drinking

Continue to drink despite physical or social problems Source: BBC Health The long-term effects of alcohol

Estimates also suggest about nine per cent of men and three per cent of women in the UK show signs of alcohol dependence.

But it is the functioning alcoholic that can slip under the radar - before their health issues are severe enough to need treatment.

Straight vodka

Dr John Marsden, an alcohol and drug dependency expert from King's College London, says a typical functioning alcoholic can manage to hold down a job despite having a ""very severe drinking problem that they have been incubating over a very long period"".

""Alcohol problems are difficult to understand because they do not occur overnight. They are hidden from view which makes functioning alcoholics a group we cannot easily help.""

Rob C, who is 61, was one of them. At his worst he was drinking 1.5 litres of straight vodka per day.

""Then I began to suffer blackouts, losing whole days and not remembering anything.""

He would be first to arrive at work, which made him able to set out his ""drinks for the day with what looked like a bottle of mineral water"".

""I would hide bottles around the office. You think nobody else knows, that it doesn't smell, that you're getting away with it. But of course they did notice.""

Life saver

For several years, maintaining a full-time finance job, he drank increasingly more during the day.

There was work, there was money and increasingly the motivation to alter ones mood quickly. Alcohol has been the drug of choice to do that Dr John Marsden, Addiction expert

What started as a social pastime nearly cost him his relationship. Now sober for eight years, looking back he says that even if a colleague had said something at the time, he would not have listened.

""I resented the changes at work and told myself I deserved a drink. I would buy wine at lunchtime and drink it from a polystyrene cup.""

Wine turned to vodka for a ""bigger kick"" and lunchtime turned to morning through to night.

Early retirement on medical grounds made his addiction worse. It was only when his partner threatened to kick him out that he sought help with Alcoholics Anonymous, who he says saved his life.

Rob is not alone. In the last decade there has been a 63% increase in prescriptions for the treatment of alcohol dependency in England, as well as a 20% rise in deaths from liver disease.

Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, a liver specialist and chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance, believes the number of people dying from liver disease will keep rising.

The majority of people who have alcohol-related health problems are middle-aged, which Sir Ian says is a consequence of chronic alcohol misuse - many years of frequent heavy drinking, rather than binge drinking - a session of drinking large amounts of alcohol in a small space of time.

But he says that though there is a big overlap, it is important to remember not all heavy social drinkers are dependent on alcohol.

""Some people can control their drinking after work, others can't. If people are frequently drinking harmful levels of alcohol - over 50 units a week for men, 35 for women - most will end up suffering some form of physical, mental or social harm.""

A lifetime's worth of drinking is catching up with baby boomers, says Emily Robinson from the Alcohol Concern.

The charity hopes that their campaign, Dry January, will help get people thinking about how much they drink, especially at home when units are harder to measure, and crucially, before they reach a stage where drinking is affecting their health.

""The issue of people drinking every day is worrying as it's a way of slipping into dependency, as you need to drink a little more each time to feel the same effects,"" she says.

Dr Marsden suggests the line between social drinking and dependency is clear. He says the first question that needs to be asked by clinicians or family members is: ""Has anyone expressed concern to you about your drinking?""

What's a unit? Half a pint of standard strength (4%) beer, cider or lager

A single pub measure of spirit (25ml)

Half a standard glass of wine (175ml) Alcohol units guide

This question assesses whether a person's behaviour has negatively impacted on someone close to them, he adds.

""If your alcohol consumption has caused a problem for someone else - I'm not rushing to label you an alcoholic but suggesting you need to take a closer look at your behaviour.""

There is a clear reason the baby boomer generation is now most at risk from alcohol-related problems, argues Dr Marsden.

A hard-working generation led to an appetite for entertainment and relaxation.

""There was work, there was money and increasingly the motivation to alter one's mood quickly. Alcohol has been the drug of choice to do that.""","['alcoholrelated', 'drink', 'alcohol', 'problems', 'health', 'baby', 'dependency', 'work', 'social', 'drinking', 'problem']","Daily drinking can start off as a social event but turn into dependency, addiction experts say.

Church rebuilds 1960s singer's life,A 1960s singer songwriter tells an audience in Redruth how his faith helped him to rebuild his life.,,None,"Image caption John Gaughan worked with many big names in the 1960s but hid his alcoholism for many years

From his early teens John Gaughan decided that he wanted to be a singer/songwriter and aim for the very top in the world of popular music.

By the time he was 19 years old he had achieved that goal.

Mr Gaughan was rubbing shoulders with the most successful writers and publishers of the day.

He was also singing with the top stars of the 1960s, as part of the band Herman's Hermits.

Mr Gaughan said: ""I was working with Billy J Kramer and Gerry Marsden and in America with Peter Noone and the Bee Gees.""

But there was one problem, as he will tell an audience at Redruth's Penventon Park Hotel on Friday 28th October.

""My life had really changed, but the only thing that remained constant was that I was an alcoholic. I had the money, and most of the time the alcohol was free.""

Mr Gaughan said he felt a huge ""emptiness inside that was increasingly being satisfied by alcohol"".

Image caption John Gaughan worked with bands, including the Bee Gees

""On the surface it looked absolutely fantastic. Behind the scenes I had to have a quarter bottle of vodka. I was walking a fine line between not having too much alcohol in my body and having just enough to stop me from shaking on stage.""

Eventually his dependence on alcohol took over and within a few years he was a broken man, ""in body, soul and spirit"".

Mr Gaughan said: ""I thought I could control it. I would give up drinking for a day, apart from the shakes. I went to my doctor and he said I would just have to give up drinking. I tried clinics, I tried hospitals. But nothing seemed to help. The desire was still there.

""Finally I couldn't cope. My marriage failed and my father died. That just left me devastated.""

Mr Gaughan eventually reached a point of total desperation and tried to end it all by throwing himself from the top window of a three storey building.

Life changing moment

He said: ""I thought I had no hope and no future. So I tried to take my own life. But I landed on my feet. I broke all the bones in my feet. Bones in my back were crushed. Yet my spinal chord remained intact.""

During the following months many people called to see him.

Mr Gaughan said: ""I was sat their drinking one night, watching the television, thinking I'm just going to lose everything again. But words came back to me about the time my Grandma told me about God. So I went to church that night. Nobody spoke to me, and I came away disappointed and went back home and sat there drinking.

""That night a man came to see me and said you don't need to be like that, there is a way out. As he was walking passed my flat he said he felt the need to come and knock on my door and tell me about Jesus. He invited me to his church. I went, and that night my life started to change.""

For the past two decades John said he had been given songs by the Lord and his heart's desire was ""to continue to touch people's lives through testimony and song"".

He said his broken bones healed and he has had ""total deliverance from his acute alcoholism"".

Living in the grip of alcohol,Concerns are growing for former England footballer Paul Gascoigne who has started drinking again. How difficult is it to fight alcohol addiction?,,None,"Image caption Paul Gascoigne has an ongoing battle with alcohol

Concerns are growing for former England footballer Paul Gascoigne who has been struggling with an addiction to alcohol.

The 45-year-old was shaking and slurred his words on stage at a charity event in Northampton on Thursday and his agent, Terry Baker, says he now fears for Gascoigne's life.

Alex Best, widow of football legend and recovering alcoholic George Best who died in 2005, is also concerned.

She told The Sun newspaper: ""Seeing Gazza in such a bad way brings back the most horrible memories of George when he was in the grip of the drink that eventually killed him.

""It's heartbreaking to see Paul so deeply gripped by his addiction again.""

Relapse can be part of recovery. That's when they really learn to move on. I've worked with people who have relapsed 20 or 30 times and have got there in the end Julie Rogers, Substance misuse manager

Dependency

NHS figures suggest nine in every 100 men and four in every 100 women show signs of alcohol dependence.

Drinking alcohol becomes a focus in daily life, meaning the person no longer has control over their drinking and depends on it to get through the day.

You don't necessarily have to be rolling around drunk to have a dependency on alcohol - people may be able to hold down a career and drink in a way that is damaging.

Dependency mean you are physically and psychologically tied to booze - you feel compelled to drink and this takes its toll on your physical and emotional health.

Julie Rogers has been working in the addiction field for 12 years, helping people who are hooked on alcohol.

Ms Rogers, who works with the charity Foundation 66, says problem drinking is a complex and incredibly difficult behaviour to break. No two people are the same and there is no single approach that is guaranteed to work.

""Alcohol addiction does not have any boundaries. It affects all types of people alike. It doesn't matter if you are wealthy or poor.

Warning signs of alcohol dependence Worrying about where your next drink is coming from and planning social, family and work events around alcohol

Finding you have a compulsive need to drink and finding it hard to stop once you start

Waking up and drinking - or feeling the need to have a drink in the morning

Suffering from withdrawal symptoms, such as sweating, shaking and nausea, which stop once you drink alcohol

""And there are so many different reasons why people drink. But the thing they do have in common is that, for them, alcohol has become more than just a drink.

""It becomes something that you need to do to cope and get through. That's when it becomes a problem.""

For some, the trigger is stress or anxiety - a demanding job or a traumatic divorce, for example.

She said for others it is a learned behaviour - something they have been exposed to during their childhood and have grown up to follow the same path.

Genetics can also make some people susceptible, experts suspect.

Breaking the cycle

Regardless of the cause, the first step to tackling addiction is the same.

Ms Rogers said: ""Recognising you have a problem and then seeking help is the first step.

""It sounds simple but, in reality it's not. It can be hard to admit you have a problem and actually do something about it.""

The former Newcastle, Tottenham and Lazio player has tried hard to fight his addiction, spending repeated spells in rehab over the last decade.

Alcohol harms Short term health risks include alcohol poisoning and accidents and injuries

Long term health consequences include an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, liver disease (which can cause jaundice), pancreatitis and certain cancers

Drinking too much can also affect your relationships and your ability to hold down a job

It can lead to anxiety, depression and suicidal feelings

Gazza's drinking problems started during his playing days.

In 1998, shortly after his divorce from wife Sheryl, he was admitted to the The Priory Hospital in Marchwood, near Southampton, to receive treatment for stress and drink problems.

In 2001, whilst playing at Everton, Gascoigne admitted himself to an alcohol rehabilitation clinic in Arizona on the insistence of his then manager Walter Smith.

Four years after retiring, in 2008, he was arrested in Newcastle and detained under the Mental Health Act and was later sectioned following reports that he was acting strangely in Hemel Hempstead.

More recently he has been treated at The Priory again and the Providence Projects treatment centre in Bournemouth.

Ms Rogers says relapses are incredibly common, and they shouldn't be seen as a failure.

""It's important that we do not judge relapse because that just compounds the shame and guilt people feel about it.

Dennis' story I took my first drink in my early teens. There were consequences from my drinking from the beginning, very small at first: arguing with friends, turning up late for social appointments, losing keys, urinating in alleyways, and general behaviours I would not engage in when I wasn't drinking. As I reached my 20s I had destroyed a marriage by now, and I was well on that alcoholic slippery downhill slope. I was starting to lose jobs as I could not be trusted to turn up for work. Into my 30s, my drinking very subtly but progressively got worse; the dry spells between my binges got shorter and shorter. I had started too waken up in strange places and also in A&E hospitals and couldn't remember how I got there. The last 10 years of my drinking, I had tried many avenues of escape in order to stop drinking completely and failed every single time. At 40 years old I was truly beaten by alcohol. I had heard and of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and had visited AA meetings in the past but nothing else, I would visit and then leave and eventually always drink again. I did not know what it was to be an alcoholic, and I had not fully admitted to myself that I was an alcoholic. Now, through AA's 12-step recovery programme, I have a productive, contented life with complete abstinence from alcohol.

""Relapse can be part of recovery. That's when they really learn to move on. I've worked with people who have relapsed 20 or 30 times and have got there in the end.

""Even if it is your thousandth relapse, it can still be the last. It's important not to give up.""

She said in order to break the cycle some people need to hit a critical point where it's ""stop drinking or die"".

Help on hand

But for others, abstinence is never an option.

Instead, they might work towards curbing their intake, even if it means they are still drinking far too much for good health.

""Some people reduce the harm rather than stop drinking.

""Some relapse every few months but still lead a fulfilling life. Even if you get a month of sobriety at least it's a month.""

She said there is plenty of help available to anyone struggling to keep their drinking under control.

""Your first port of call should be your GP who can direct you to your local alcohol services.""

Support may include home-based and community detoxification programmes, counselling and group work.

Friends and family also have a role to play.

Friend and former England player Alan Shearer has said: ""It won't be easy, but he [Gazza] needs to dig deep and find the energy and the will to do it.

""What he needs to know most of all is that he is loved.""","['drink', 'alcohol', 'work', 'grip', 'drinking', 'stop', 'addiction', 'living', 'rogers', 'thats', 'need', 'alcoholic']","Drinking alcohol becomes a focus in daily life, meaning the person no longer has control over their drinking and depends on it to get through the day.

Activities offer hope to recovering addicts,People recovering from drug and alcohol addiction in Gwynedd and Anglesey have been boosted by a new charity which offers support day and night.,,None,"Image caption More than 70 people have contacted AGRO at Holyhead and Bangor since last September

People recovering from drug and alcohol addiction in Gwynedd and Anglesey have been boosted by a new charity which offers support day and night.

The Anglesey and Gwynedd Recovery Organisation (AGRO) uses activities like gardening and group sessions to support people in their bid to give up drink and drugs.

More than 70 people have already approached AGRO's Holyhead and Bangor groups for help since it was set up last September, just through word of mouth recommendation.

Its founders are now starting to publicise their work and have secured funding from the Safer Anglesey and Gwynedd partnerships to set up groups in Amlwch, Llangefni and Caernarfon.

Huw Harries, who is a support worker for the dug and alcohol rehabilitation organisation CAIS by day, co-founded the charity in his spare time using his own funds.

Image caption AGRO hope to soon launch groups in Amlwch, Llangefni and Caernarfon

As a former alcoholic himself, Huw feels able to reach out to those who are also fighting to get sober.

He said: ""I haven't had a drink in 15 years. I used to be a nightclub manager and I suppose I'm on the other side of the fence now.

""I gave up because my wife gave me an ultimatum, saying she'd go back to Scotland if I didn't. I'm so glad I did because she died of cancer two years later and I was able to nurse her with a clear head.""

But after working for CAIS for eight years, Huw realised that those in need had nowhere to turn to in the evenings or weekends.

Now AGRO offer 24-hour phone support to help an addict avoid having another drink or talk them through a period of anxiety.

But AGRO's other aim is to help people to recover through getting involved in new activities.

They have already turned a piece of Holyhead waste ground into a productive vegetable garden and have future plans to acquire more allotments and open a shop to sell their produce. They will plough any profit back into the community.

They also organise walks, kayaking sessions and fishing at weekends to help people get active and have something else to think about.

""It gives people something else to do when they come out of rehab after three or six months,"" explained Huw.

""And people really want to do it. It isn't often you have alcohol and drug addicts working on something together.""

He was spurred on to start the groups on Anglesey after figures suggested more people from the island were admitted into Bangor's Ysbyty Gwynedd with alcohol-related problems than from anywhere in Gwynedd.

But from small beginnings, he see big demand for AGRO's work.

""We have all sorts of members,"" said Huw. ""Students, people who own their own businesses, housewives, unemployed people.

""The days of people drinking all day haven't completely gone, but mostly now people binge-drink when they get stressed, or have a glass or two, or a bottle every night.

""And the price of alcohol doesn't matter. If you want a drink you'll get it, even if there are no buses and you have to walk a long way.

""It's easier to get some alcohol than call a doctor for help at night.""

Although Huw is happy to help those who want to recover, he thinks that educating those who are yet to find themselves in trouble is ultimately the way forward.

""We want to go into schools or go to the WI to educate people about the side-effects of alcohol,"" he said.

""If you catch people early enough, then you'll avoid spending money on A&E or on unemployment, divorce or sorting out the effect on the kids.""

""I've seen the suffering it can cause and want to help people early on.""

The singer posted a heartfelt Instagram message alongside a progress tracker from the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous.

""So grateful. It's been quite the journey. So many ups and downs,"" she wrote.

The 24-year-old has been open about her struggles with substance abuse, eating disorders and depression.

The former Disney Channel star says she turned to drugs and alcohol to cope with the pressures of fame.

In 2010 she checked herself into rehab after a violent argument with a friend and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

Since then she's found help and has become a spokesperson for mental health awareness.

She was honoured with the Artistic Award of Courage earlier this month in LA for her work as a mental health advocate.

Demi's also released a book and a documentary about people who struggle with mental health problems.

""So many times I wanted to relapse but sat on my hands and begged God to relieve the obsession,"" she continues in the Instagram post.

""I'm so proud of myself but I couldn't have done it without my higher power (God), my family, friends, and everyone else who supported me.

What he witnessed in those minutes changed his life profoundly and will, he believes, continue to haunt him until the day he dies.

The moment he walked through the revolving doors of his office building and stepped on to the street on that sunny September morning, Artie Van Why's world shifted a few degrees on its axis.

It was like the Wizard of Oz, stepping into another world

His life from that instant took a different course, propelled by the mayhem that enveloped him that day, events the world later identified by two numbers, nine and 11.

Millions of people watched on television as four hijacked planes crashed in the US, two of them into one famous New York landmark. But Van Why was in the thick of it.

The experience forced him to leave New York, his home for 26 years, and move more than 100 miles west to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, deep in Amish country.

Ten years after the atrocities, sitting in the corner of a humble one-bedroom apartment located above a funeral home, his face is a picture of concentration as he recalls the day's events.

""I remember it was a beautiful day. Whenever I see a really beautiful blue sky, it takes me back to that morning.""

He was working as a clerical assistant at law firm Holland & Knight, and his office was on the 23rd floor of a building separated from the World Trade Center site only by Church Street and the Millennium Hilton hotel. At 08:46, a loud boom shook the building.

A colleague asked if it was thunder, then someone screamed for everyone to get out of the building, because a plane had hit one of the twin towers. Expecting to see a small aircraft sticking out of the famous skyscraper, Van Why took the lift to the ground floor and exited through a revolving door.

""It was like the Wizard of Oz, stepping into another world. It seemed as everything slowed down and it was going frame by frame as if in slow motion.

""All these white paper sheets were covering the ground like snow and coming down. I remember thinking that I'd never seen so much paper.

""I walked a short distance to Church Street where the towers were and that's when I saw the North Tower for the first time. I was dumbstruck. It was hard to comprehend what I was seeing.

""There was a huge black hole, the flames were bright orange and the smoke was billowing out of the tower.""

More people were arriving on the streets, he says, and sirens could be heard in the background. As his recollections become more vivid, the 58-year-old closes his eyes and rocks back and forth in his orange armchair, his right foot tapping the carpet vigorously.

His rented apartment is full of reminders of what he went through. A photo of the World Trade Center is on the fridge, and other photographs featuring the famous Manhattan skyline adorn the living room, like pictures of a deceased member of the family.

Image caption Reminders of the life left behind fill his apartment

One wall is full of framed newspaper cuttings, reviews of the play that Van Why - a former actor - wrote and performed about 9/11. And in front of this shrine, he sits and recalls the minutes that reshaped his life, wild hand gestures making the scene all the more real.

""I don't know how long I was looking at the North Tower, trying to take it all in. I was transfixed. What broke it was when I realised there were other things falling, there were people falling and everyone realised at the same time.

""People started screaming and my reaction was to scream 'No, No, No!' at the thought that people were falling down. And that's when - I don't know why I reacted in this way - but my instinct was to run towards them.

I remember shouting out 'God, save us all!

""I ran to the plaza where they were falling. I didn't have a moment's thought, I just ran towards the tower, thinking 'Can I help these people?' I imagined them laying there and the thought of being able to hold their hand or sit and be with them, comfort them.""

Another man was running with him, and for a moment, the two stopped and stood side by side, taking in the enormity of what they were seeing - human beings jumping to their deaths. Van Why recalls seeing bodies piling up on the ground.

""One of my most vivid memories is looking to my left and I saw this man in a suit falling. Somehow I had thought that if you ever jumped from a high place, you would be dead before you hit the ground.

""But I remember seeing how very much alive he was and I can still see his arms and legs moving as if to brace himself. Fortunately I didn't see him hit.""

Some guards shouted for the two men to come to safety through another World Trade Center Building, number 5. They went down a lift and out of the site on to Church Street, from where Van Why saw the second plane hit the South Tower, only 17 minutes after the first.

Pandemonium broke out. Debris was raining down, he says, as he ran towards Fulton Street, at one point falling to the ground.

""People started to run over the top of me and I thought I was going to be trampled to death but I managed to get up. I remember shouting out 'God, save us all!'""

He recalls an African-American woman tripping and being helped to her feet by a businessman. Then he ran past a large man who was lying face down in the street.

Getting down on his knees, Van Why saw that the man had a serious head injury. He appeared to have been hit by a putty knife that had fallen from one of the buildings and was lying nearby stained with blood.

""Another man stopped and gave me a denim jacket which we put over the open wound and then I remember seeing his watch on the street beside him and I put it in his pants [trouser] pocket. We turned him over and he had a work tag with a name.""

With tears falling and his voice cracking, Van Why goes on: ""My biggest regret is that I didn't look to his tag to see what the name was. I could have found his family and told them that there were people with him.""

An ambulance arrived and it required several people to lift the man on to the stretcher. Van Why stroked his arm and told him he would be fine.

Realising he had left his mobile phone in the office, he began asking strangers if he could borrow one to get the message through to his parents that he was OK. But none of the phones were working, so he went into a cafe and used a telephone there.

When he emerged, he heard a deafening sound. He looked to his left and saw a wall of grey smoke coming towards him. The South Tower was collapsing.

For the second time that morning, he started running. The time was 09:59, 73 minutes after the first plane flew into the North Tower.

By the time he got to his apartment on 43rd Street, after deliberately avoiding the area around the Empire State Building, it was approaching noon. The North Tower had also collapsed, but Van Why had been far enough away to not hear it.

In the days that followed, he slept only fitfully and always with the bedroom light on.

""I was afraid of the dark. It never happened before 9/11. It was a sense of security having that light on.

""For that first week I would wake up early and call my parents first thing. I would be on the phone crying with them. There was a lot of crying that week.

""I was feeling sadness and grief and mourning like I had never felt, similar to losing a loved one. And still an incomprehension, trying to understand what had happened.""

He avoided watching television or reading newspapers because he could not bear to see replays or photos of the planes striking the towers. He had his own images, pictures inside his head, sometimes appearing with a clarity that transported him back to the mayhem.

He discovered that two men who lived in his apartment building were missing and a lawyer at work who was last seen running towards the towers was also presumed dead.

Van Why had done exactly the same and survived. As a recovering alcoholic who had been sober for two years, he already had a therapist, and in the weeks following 9/11 he saw him daily.

Alcoholics Anonymous meetings were also an opportunity to share his feelings with others, but he lived alone and had no partner to provide constant support. Before long he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

Holland & Knight opened makeshift offices at a hotel in Midtown but he did not feel able to go back to work until two or three weeks after the attacks. When he did, it was the first time he had ventured outside his neighbourhood.

A few days later, he rented a car and drove to Maryland, for a 30-year high school reunion. The sight of an aeroplane coming into land caused him to burst into tears. At the event, when he introduced himself by saying: ""I'm from the greatest city in the world, New York City,"" people stood up and applauded.

His old offices near Ground Zero were soon ready again, but Van Why found returning to the scene too harrowing to endure. The smell of smoke from the still-smouldering site would fill his nostrils as he emerged from the subway.

The WTC plaza - once his lunchtime sanctuary - now resembled to him a grave. One morning, the police allowed him to enter the site so he could lay six roses on what he regarded as ""hallowed ground"".

In November 2001, he resigned from work after 13 years of service. It was too painful to continue. He instead focused on his new project - writing his own story about his experience.

I was out of the country and didn't get back to New York City until the end of October. I was in touch with Artie, aware of his proximity, but didn't fully understand the impact on him until I got home. It was unravelling. It could only be unravelling. No-one should have to witness something like that. In survival mode, he knew he no longer could stay in NYC. His family, which had always been a strong connection in his life, would provide a sense of comfort and familiarity he desperately needed. He moved out of the city and regrouped. It took time. Through his grief and pain he also found a creative outlet. He was able to process his grief by writing about it.

He had written emails to family and friends following the attacks, to explain what happened, and they forwarded his story to other people. Soon he began to receive appreciative emails from strangers.

Encouraged, he began to develop his story into a script, convinced it was his mission to keep the memory alive. It became a one-man play that he performed off-Broadway and in Los Angeles.

""The play gave me a sense of purpose. Those two years after 9/11, when I was really focused on my play, that is the only time in my life I felt fulfilled, because I had a purpose and I thought I was doing something important and something selfless, because I was doing it for the memory of the people I saw die.""

After each performance, some people would tell him their own story of where they were, making him realise, he says, that people across the US had a story of 9/11.

He was hoping he could continue performing the show for at least five years.

""I wanted to dedicate my life to it. But it closed in New York earlier than planned, the major papers ignored it and some reviews were critical, saying I was trying to profit out of it.""

It seemed to him like the city was ready to move on and he was not. The spirit that defined New York in the days, weeks and months afterwards had gone, he says, and he felt a bit like a ""lone crusader"".

Image caption Van Why performed his play in 2003

""It still weighed so heavily on my emotions and who I was, so to see other people weren't doing that and moving on, it was like 'How can they be doing that?'

""There was anger and a feeling of isolation. In the month after 9/11, it was all you talked about with strangers, but two years afterwards, there was a sense that 'OK, you don't need to talk about this any more.'""

Immersing himself for years in writing and performing the play probably held him back, he admits, because he was dwelling on the events and re-living them, but not dealing with the emotions.

That process did not begin until he moved. In September 2003, he started a new life in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, because he wanted to be near his parents.

""I never thought I would leave New York, I envisaged my last days would be in New York but it just seemed like the right thing to do.""

He felt guilty about leaving, but the pull of family was overwhelming and he felt like he had nowhere else to go.

""All of a sudden I just needed to be closer to them, I wanted it and needed it. For me and my parents, the reality that 9/11 was a day that I could have died brought the importance of being with my family to me.

""Though I was in my 50s, there was a sense that I needed mummy and daddy, that sense of security and that sense of home.""

Growing up, home was Gaithersburg in Maryland, where the young Van Why was a quiet boy, according to his parents.

Thelma and Art Van Why His parents endured a terrifying few hours on 11 Sept 2001 while they waited for news

Relief at hearing he was OK turned to despair as they watched their son spiral into depression

But in 2003, he moved to be near to them both

""We're so happy that he's moved because we became closer. It's a big change,"" says Thelma. ""But to see your own child go through that, you wonder what you can do to help.""

""He was in his own little shell, his own little world and we would try to comfort him as much as we could,"" says Art. ""We just told him we were here for him. So it's really helped me to know he's starting to come round.""

He says he felt different from other children - he later realised he was gay - and was bullied.

After high school, he attended a small, conservative Christian college, where he majored first in Bible studies, then in drama.

He moved to New York in 1977 with the dream of becoming an actor but after struggling for 10 years to get sustained work in the theatre, he gave it up. The clerical work that had been a supplement to his income became his main and only job.

As a young man, he'd had a difficult relationship with his parents and throughout his adult life he had seen them only three or four times a year. It was not until he moved to Pennsylvania, two years after the attacks, that his relationship with them, in his own words, ""fully healed"".

""I didn't know what it would entail, moving here, but eight years later, my relationship with my parents is incredible. It has a depth and appreciation it has never had before.""

When he arrived in 2003, he didn't have a job, an apartment or a car, and he left many long-standing friendships behind in New York. And there was no-one who could relate to what he had been through.

After the bright lights of Manhattan, the small city of Lancaster - with fewer than 60,000 residents and a homespun, rural charm - struck a tranquil note.

Van Why withdrew socially, spending a lot of time in what he calls his ""cave"", a room where he would just watch television endlessly at weekends. Even when he was coaxed out of his isolation by colleagues for a coffee, he was lost and distracted.

A low period at the end of last year, when he was often breaking down, was his grief finally being released, he believes.

""I was very fortunate I did not lose my physical life but I lost my life as I knew it. The person I was on September 10th, that person is no longer. I had to go through a very emotional period which enabled me to go and face Ground Zero.""

In the last few months he has started to come out of his metaphorical cave. The first step on the road to recovery was going back to New York in April, for the first time since he left in 2003. With his parents and sister Sue by his side, he visited the place that had haunted him for nearly a decade.

""That was a huge step for me. It was very emotional but it helped to put an end to that chapter of my life. Even though I had been away for eight years, there was guilt that I had left my city when it was still healing.""

Only having closed that door, could he start to regard Lancaster as home, he says. Shortly after that trip, he met someone and began a relationship.

""Being with him, I realised that I had forgotten what it was like to be happy. It's like I am stepping back into life. I'm finally moving past mourning.""

But there are other struggles. He has two jobs, one in the box office of the Fulton Theatre in Lancaster, and another as a cashier in a Weis supermarket. The two incomes combined earn him about $20,000 (£12,196) a year, about $50,000 (£30,494) less than he was earning in New York.

'I witnessed the goodness of man' ""I don't believe I had witnessed the wrath of anyone's God that morning. What I had been a witness to when I looked up at those burning towers was the ultimate evil that man is capable of. The evidence of just how deep hatred could run, how far it could go. But I had also been a witness to something else that day - down on the ground. I witnessed the ultimate goodness of man, the evidence of how strong courage could be, to what lengths it would go. I believe God was in the hands of everyone who reached out to someone else. He was in the arms of people on the streets as they embraced one another. He was in the tears of strangers who cried together. He was in all the lives that were given in the line of duty, in the acts of heroism. He was in the hearts of the people across the country who, as they watched the horror from afar, felt compassion."" That Day In September

It's a thorn in his side, he says. ""I have debts and try to pay them off when I can and meet my basic expenses. So far, I've been lucky to just get by.""

If he had been told in 2001 that in 10 years he would be living in Pennsylvania and working in a theatre and a supermarket, he would have been shocked.

""I liked my job. I liked working down there. And, yes, I was making a good salary. I would like to think I might have developed a relationship with someone.

""At the time of 9/11, I was in the best place I had been for a long time - sober and happy. Perhaps I would have been able to take vacations and travel, things I'm unable to do now.""

And the images are still there every day, sometimes popping into his head without warning, with such force that he zones out while his mind revisits the carnage.

""They are like snippets of a movie. I will replay watching this one man who I saw falling, watching him. I will flash to the injured man I saw laying in the streets. It's a series of vignettes that my mind just goes back to.""

A siren is enough to take him back there and it's a sound that makes his body tighten. He still has not boarded a plane, although tall buildings don't instil in him the same fear they once did.

A study by Cornell University suggests that the trauma suffered by witnesses like Van Why may have physically altered their brains, damaging their ability to process emotions.

He says 9/11 survivors and witnesses like himself are the ""forgotten majority"", never considered among the victims.

What I was doing for a long time was letting 9/11 define who I was

""They're not letting any survivors to the [10th anniversary] ceremony in New York, it's just bereaved family members.

""There's a sense that you don't count. Some people are still struggling terribly, far worse than I am. Everyone who was there is still affected to a degree, but people don't remember us.

""We're not suffering physically and weren't injured that day and didn't lose a family member. It's like we don't count.""

Despite the financial and mental strains, he is now looking to the future with a new optimism.

""It's my life now and I've never accepted that before. That's another change in the past months. Not that I was fighting it before, but there's an acceptance, I'm moving out of the mourning stage and back to life again.""

It's comparable to losing a partner, he says, with the memory of that loved one never disappearing but gradually losing its hold.

""I can't imagine a day going by when I don't think about it, even as a passing thought.

""What I was doing for a long time was letting 9/11 define who I was and I think I'm getting away from that now. My experience of 9/11 is part of who I am but not all of me.""

State must 'go further' to help addicts,"The state should do more to help addicts and make them employable, Iain Duncan Smith says, with removing benefits a ""hypothetical"" option.",,None,"Image copyright SPL Image caption Some say withdrawing benefits from drug users would lead them into crime

The state should intervene further to help drug and alcohol addicts recover and make them employable in future, a senior cabinet minister has said.

In a speech to Alcoholics Anonymous, Iain Duncan Smith argued that addicts who are unable to work are being let down by the welfare system.

The BBC understands removing benefits from people refusing treatment will be an option but a ""hypothetical"" one.

One drug charity said such a move would set a ""dangerous precedent"".

In 2010, the Home Office considered plans to remove benefits from addicts who refused treatment as part of the government's drug strategy but these were not pursued.

According to the Department for Work and Pensions, 40,000 people claim incapacity benefits - citing alcoholism as their primary condition. Of these, about a third have been claiming for more than a decade.

The government also says 80% of the UK's 400,000 ""problem drug users"" are claiming out-of-work benefits.

'Road to recovery'

In a speech in Parliament, Mr Duncan Smith said ""the outdated benefits system fails to get people off drugs and put their lives on track"".

""We have started changing how addicts are supported but we must go further to actively take on the devastation that drugs and alcohol can cause.

""We want to do more to encourage and support claimants into rehabilitation for addiction and starting them on the road to recovery and eventually work.""

There is no evidence that using the stick of benefit sanctions will help people to positively engage with treatment and support their recovery Martin Barnes, DrugScope

Mr Duncan Smith said the introduction of a single, consolidated benefit known as Universal Credit from next year - more details of which will be published on Thursday - will simplify the benefits system and provide more financial incentives for employment, helping all claimants.

""Getting people into work and encouraging independence is our ultimate goal,"" he added.

""Universal Credit will put people on a journey towards sustainable recovery so they are better placed to look for work in future.""

The BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason said Mr Duncan Smith, in his speech, hinted that a lack of willingness to seek help for addictions could lead to a cut in benefits.

But a source close to the minister emphasised that the universal credit would make it easier to ""track people through the system"" and ensure they get the help they need.

""Hypothetically people could lose benefits,"" the source told the BBC. ""You do have to have sanctions. But very few people refuse treatment.""

'No evidence'

Charities said many addicts were not receiving the support they needed at job centres and through the government's flagship welfare-to-work programme.

One of these, DrugScope, said it would be asking ministers to ""clarify"" their position on sanctions for refusing treatment.

""We are surprised and concerned at reports that ministers believe that stopping benefits is an appropriate or effective way of engaging people with drug or alcohol treatment and supporting their recovery,"" said its chief executive Martin Barnes

""If accurate, this would be a reversal of the government's publicly stated position.""

It said ministers had dropped plans, proposed by the previous Labour government, to require all those attending job centres to answer questions about possible drug and alcohol use.

""There is no evidence that using the stick of benefit sanctions will help people to positively engage with treatment and support their recovery,"" Mr Barnes added.

""Indeed, the risk is that people will disengage from support services, potentially worsening their dependency and the impacts on their families and communities. Linking benefit to a requirement to undergo treatment would set a dangerous precedent for people with physical or mental health problems.""

All those claiming employment and support allowance - which has replaced incapacity benefit - are currently being re-assessed under plans aimed at getting more people into work and reducing the welfare bill.

Critics have complained that the medical tests being used are flawed and too many people are being deemed fit to work when they are not.","['smith', 'recovery', 'benefit', 'addicts', 'work', 'benefits', 'support', 'treatment', 'state', 'drug', 'help']","Image copyright SPL Image caption Some say withdrawing benefits from drug users would lead them into crimeThe state should intervene further to help drug and alcohol addicts recover and make them employable in future, a senior cabinet minister has said.

Scheme to tackle A&E violence introduced in Glasgow,"A project to tackle violence in A&E departments, thought to be the first of its kind in the UK, is operating in Glasgow.",,2016-03-30T02:10:49+00:00,"Image copyright Violence Reduction Unit

A project to tackle violence in A&E departments, thought to be the first of its kind in the UK, has been introduced in Glasgow.

The Navigators Scheme, funded by Police Scotland's Violence Reduction Unit, has been operating at Glasgow Royal Infirmary (GRI) since December.

It involves two navigators establishing a connection with people who are victims or perpetrators of violence.

They later discuss the agencies and services that can help them.

This could include relationship counselling or putting them in touch with organisations such as Alcoholics Anonymous or Shelter.

The Navigator scheme is the first to be available for anyone being treated in an accident and emergency department.

But a charity in London called Redthread has been running hospital-based violence intervention programmes specifically for young people for the past 11 years

'No violent o'clock'

Doctors at the GRI said the project was one of the most important innovations they had seen in decades.

They hope the scheme can be rolled out to A&E departments across Scotland.

Senior consultant, Donogh Maguire, said it was possibly the most valuable non-medical change in the management of A&E in the whole course of his career.

Image copyright Violence Reduction Unit Image caption Navigators Tam Begbie and Alan Gilmour have been working at the hospital since December

""I think for inner-city hospitals, this should be a standard means of engaging with the homeless and disenfranchised people that we have coming to our departments,"" he said.

""The reason I say this is because the current mechanisms are failing or the people are not engaging with them, whereas here we're getting the navigators catching people at a time when they're amenable to some intervention.""

One of the navigators, Alan Gilmour, said the work was highly unpredictable.

""We don't know what's coming in, we don't know what's happening,"" he said.

""I mean, there's no 'violent o'clock'. We begin our shift and we just wait or find out if there's anyone in and if there's not we wait around for that to happen.""

By James Shaw, BBC Scotland

It's after 10pm on a Thursday in the accident and emergency department at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Tam Begbie is sitting on the hard vinyl floor talking to a young woman with peroxide blonde hair slumped in a chair in front of him.

In the hubbub of an A&E starting to get busier as the night goes on, no-one else can hear the substance of their conversation. But that is as it should be.

Tam is not talking to the woman to explain her treatment or to find out if she's committed a crime. He is simply trying to help. Because as a navigator, that is his job.

The agencies behind this scheme are Police Scotland's Violence Reduction Unit and the doctors' group, Medics Against Violence.

They decided on the job title, navigator, because it describes the aim of the role, which is to help people steer their way through the agencies that might be able to help them escape the lifestyles that are making them victims and possibly perpetrators of violence.

Tam discovers the young woman with the broken wrist got the injury in a fall. It might have happened during an argument with her boyfriend.

He is now in the reception area, wanting to see her. Tam might decide that it is not safe for them to get together at this point.

'Transformative effect'

But he will advise the young woman that he can meet her to talk about her situation tomorrow or the day after. Maybe in a cafe or fast food restaurant - wherever she feels comfortable.

He will suggest places where she might seek help. It might be relationship counselling or Alcoholics Anonymous. Or Shelter if she needs to find somewhere new to live to escape an abusive relationship.

The genius of the navigator concept is that it offers help to people in the direst need at exactly the time when they might be most ready to make a change.

And it recognises that doctors and police officers cannot always offer permanent solutions to deep-rooted problems.

The value of the scheme is fully acknowledged by the head of A&E at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Alastair Ireland. He allowed the navigators in last December and has seen the difference they can make.

At the moment, this is just a small pilot scheme, but doctors at the GRI agree that having navigators in every A&E in Scotland could have a transformative effect on the problems of violence they and the rest of society have to deal with.","['navigators', 'introduced', 'woman', 'young', 'navigator', 'reduction', 'unit', 'scheme', 'help', 'violence', 'tackle', 'glasgow', 'ae']","Image copyright Violence Reduction UnitA project to tackle violence in A&E departments, thought to be the first of its kind in the UK, has been introduced in Glasgow.

Starring Sue Johnston and John Hannah.,,None,"Comedy drama by Pete Jackson set in Alcoholics Anonymous and inspired by Jackson’s own road to recovery. Starring Sue Johnston and John Hannah.

The programme follows the lives of five very different recovering alcoholics – set entirely at their weekly meetings. Listeners hear as they get to know each other, learn to hate each other, argue, moan, laugh, fall apart, fall in love and, most importantly, tell their stories.

In this first offering, Fiona, a competitive and snobby ex-banker, tries to come to terms with the fact that she might have more in common with the rest of the group than she'd like to admit.

Writer Pete Jackson is a recovering alcoholic and has spent time with Alcoholics Anonymous. It was there he found, as many people do, support from the unlikeliest group of disparate souls, all banded together due to one common bond. As well as offering the support he needed throughout a difficult time, AA also offered a weekly, sometimes daily, dose of hilarity, upset, heartbreak and friendship.

Harrogate schools to use drama to tackle teenage drinking,Schools in North Yorkshire are piloting a theatre scheme which aims to educate children about the dangers of alcohol.,,None,"Image caption The play tells the life-story of the American millionaire who founded Alcoholics Anonymous

Schools in North Yorkshire are piloting a theatre scheme which aims to educate teenagers about the dangers of alcohol.

Harrogate has one of the highest levels of alcohol-related hospital admissions for under 18s in Yorkshire, according to the Centre for Public Health.

The play, by Bryan Bounds, is about the life of Bill Wilson the found of Alcoholics Anonymous.

Mr Bounds said the drama allowed students to learn about alcoholism and its destructive effects.

'Growing concern'

My Name is Bill, which is performed by Mr Bounds, the founder of the Leeds-based Amerrycan Theatre, was shown to critical praise at the Edinburgh Fringe and has been adapted for use in education.

Mr Bounds, himself a recovering alcoholic, said: ""I've watched with growing concern about how alcohol has become such a big issue for young people.

""A lot of alcohol education is quite patronising and condescending but students are very switched on, very sophisticated.""

The Centre for Public Health said Harrogate was second only to Wakefield in Yorkshire for alcohol-related hospital admissions for under 18s.

The drama is being shown to Year 12 students at Ashville College and St Aiden's School.

Marion Farrar, business liaison officer at St Aiden's School, said: ""I think young people see alcohol as a norm these days which is a worrying trend.

""It is becoming more and more what you do on a night out as a matter of rite.""","['drama', 'yorkshire', 'alcohol', 'theatre', 'young', 'bounds', 'public', 'drinking', 'students', 'st', 'schools', 'harrogate', 'tackle', 'shown', 'play', 'teenage']","Harrogate has one of the highest levels of alcohol-related hospital admissions for under 18s in Yorkshire, according to the Centre for Public Health.

Peter Holder jailed for 1988 rape of woman,A man who dragged a woman from a phone box and raped her 26 years ago is jailed.,,None,"Image copyright Police Image caption Peter Holder admitted the charges at Reading Crown Court last month

A man who dragged a woman from a phone box and raped her 26 years ago has been jailed for 11 and a half years after a review linked his DNA to the crime.

Peter Holder was 22 when he grabbed the 30-year-old woman in Reading and raped her in a car park. He drove her two miles before letting her go.

Holder, 48, from Tippett Rise, pleaded guilty in August to rape.

Reading Crown Court heard Holder was jailed for three years and four months in 2010 for another historical crime.

Holder pleaded guilty to an attempted rape he committed 1987 - five months before the Reading attack - following another cold case review.

'Frightened to go out'

Holder, who also admitted indecent assault and kidnap in relation to the 1988 attack, was only arrested in May this year when modern technology identified DNA found on the woman belonged to him.

Judge Joanna Cutts said the delay was caused either because of the technology at the time not identifying the DNA or because there had been no match found at the time.

On the night of the attack the woman had been drinking after leaving an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

Alan Blake, prosecuting, said she realised that she was not safe to walk home so she went into a phone box in Watlington Street to call a taxi.

Holder and another man dragged her out before he raped and indecently assaulted her. The woman was driven to Shinfield where she was freed.

Further details about the other man were not mentioned in court.

Reading the victim's impact statement, Judge Cutts said: ""Peter Holder took away my life. He took away all my self-worth.""

Judge Cutts added: ""She has been unable to work since the incident. She is still all these years later frightened to go out.""

Holder was put on the sex offenders register for life.","['jailed', 'peter', '1988', 'technology', 'woman', 'man', 'holder', 'attack', 'cutts', 'rape', 'reading', 'raped', 'dna', 'took']","Peter Holder was 22 when he grabbed the 30-year-old woman in Reading and raped her in a car park.

The headstones with unusual stories to tell,A tour around the interesting stories found lurking in English graveyards.,,2017-07-01T23:53:51+00:00,"Image copyright Getty Images

Cemeteries offer a heady mix of history, beauty, nature and death to those who enjoy browsing around them. Burial grounds such as Highgate in north London, which host the graves of the rich and famous, draw thousands of visitors. But there are scores of other less well known but interesting graves around England.

The barmaid who taunted a tiger

Image copyright Getty Images

In 1703, Hannah Twynnoy became Britain's first recorded victim of a tiger.

She was a barmaid at the White Lion in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, when a travelling menagerie set up in the pub's large rear yard, ready to attract paying crowds.

Hannah was warned against upsetting the tiger but she enjoyed bothering and poking at the big cat - until one day it discovered the cage door was open. Fed up of the pesky barmaid, the tiger launched itself on the unfortunate servant and mauled her to death.

The stone, in Malmesbury Abbey has the epitaph:

In bloom of life

She's snatched from hence

She had not room to make defence;

For Tyger fierce

Took life away

And here she lies

In a bed of clay

Until the Resurrection Day.

The diver who saved a cathedral

Image copyright FindaGrave/Getty Images

William Walker was a deep-sea diver who, in 1905, was employed to help repair the foundations of Winchester Cathedral.

Large cracks had appeared in the cathedral's walls and vaulted ceilings, some of which were wide enough for owls to roost in.

Because Winchester has a high underlying water table and the cathedral is built on peaty soil, trenches dug below filled with water before any reinforcing work could be done.

So Walker, who usually worked at Portsmouth dockyard, was recruited.

A tunnel was excavated beneath the building and for six years he spent nearly six hours a day underwater, in darkness, replacing and shoring up the foundations with his bare hands. He worked entirely by touch. Eventually he propped the cathedral up with 900,000 bricks, 114,900 concrete blocks and 25,800 bags of cement.

Because it took him so long to put on and take off his heavy diving suit, when he stopped for a break he would just take off his helmet in order to eat his lunch and smoke his pipe.

As if that was not enough effort, each weekend he cycled 150 miles - home to Croydon, south London, before returning to work on Monday.

He died aged 49 during the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918. His grave, at Beckenham Cemetery in Bromley, south-east London, bears the words: ""The diver who with his own hands saved Winchester Cathedral.""

The soldier whose beer was too weak

In Winchester, there is a grave which pays homage to a 26-year-old grenadier in the North Regiment of the Hants Militia. Thomas Thetcher died after drinking contaminated small (weak) beer when he was hot.

Before the invention of modern sanitation, people would drink small beer when fresh water was unavailable. This was because the alcohol was toxic to water-borne pathogens.

However, it was not enough to prevent Thetcher catching a fever and dying.

Following his death in 1764, his comrades arranged for a jocular headstone inscription warning of the dangers of drink. It read:

Here sleeps in peace a Hampshire Grenadier,

Who caught his death by drinking cold small beer,

Soldiers be wise from his untimely fall

And when ye're hot drink strong or none at all.

In 1918, the tombstone caught the attention of a young American soldier called Bill Wilson, who was camped nearby with his US Army unit.

Twenty-one years later, following a battle with alcoholism, he founded Alcoholics Anonymous and in 1939 published a book about his experience.

In it he claimed the gravestone had been an ""ominous warning which I failed to heed"", and printed the first two lines of the verse in the front of his book.

However, it appears he misunderstood the headstone, as he missed out the crucial advice about only drinking strong beer.

On 12 May - the anniversary of Thetcher's death - people gather at the grave to drink (strong) beer and raise a glass to the grenadier.

Peter the Wild Boy

Image copyright Neale Monks/Historic Royal Palaces

Peter had been found living alone and naked in a German forest in 1725. He could not talk, and would scamper about on all fours rather than walk.

When he was about 12 he was brought to London by King George I where he became a ""human pet"" at Kensington Palace. However, his inability to learn table manners or speech, hatred of wearing clothes - even his specially-made green velvet suit - and lack of decorum led to him falling out of favour.

The court paid for him to retire to a Hertfordshire farm with a generous pension and when he died, aged about 72, the locals paid for a headstone. Even today, flowers are laid on his grave.

Peter's funeral was held at St Mary's Church, Northchurch , Hertfordshire, and was paid for by the government. His gravestone was provided by local people.

At the time, courtiers assumed Peter's behaviour was the result of being brought up by wolves or bears. However, modern analysis of a portrait suggests Peter had a rare genetic condition known as Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome.

The bleeding tombstone of Richard Smith

St Mary's Church in Hinckley, Leicestershire, is the last resting place of Richard Smith who was killed on 12 April 1727, aged 20.

Although his headstone is fairly run-of-the-mill, the story behind his death serves as an abject warning to young men with a fondness for messing about when they should be paying attention.

According to the local history club, a recruiting sergeant for the army had come to Hinckley and was singing the praises of taking the King's shilling. Richard, rather than listening, made jokes and quips until the recruiter lost his temper. In a slight overreaction, the soldier gave the crowd an unplanned demonstration in how to use a pike in close quarter combat - and killed Richard.

For years there were reports of the headstone appearing red and tradition held the gravestone sweated blood on the anniversary of the murder.

However, a more prosaic explanation was suggested by a researcher in 1936. The gravestone used to be positioned under a block of red sandstone and it was thought that the ""blood"" being sweated may have resulted in water dripping from this block.

The Woodplumpton Witch

Nestled among the neat headstones at St Anne's churchyard in Woodplumpton, near Preston, is a boulder marking the grave of Meg Shelton.

Known as ""the Fylde Hag"", she was accused of witchcraft in the late 17th Century. Allegations centred on the fairly tame ""stealing milk"" and the more-impressive ""turning herself into a animal"".

She was killed in mysterious circumstances when a barrel crushed her against the wall of her cottage.

Folklore has it she dug her way out of her grave on more than one occasion. She was eventually buried head down in a narrow shaft so that if she tried to claw her way out she would be heading in the wrong direction - and instead burrow her way to Hell.

The boulder was put on top as an extra way of keeping her anchored in the grave.

According to legend, if you walk three times around the boulder while chanting ""I don't believe in witches"", Meg's bony hand will rise from her grave and grasp your ankle.","['unusual', 'drink', 'london', 'death', 'way', 'tell', 'headstones', 'water', 'copyright', 'gravestone', 'winchester', 'grave', 'headstone']","Image copyright Getty ImagesCemeteries offer a heady mix of history, beauty, nature and death to those who enjoy browsing around them.

"Could you be a workaholic, addicted to your job?","Most of us like to be a diligent worker, but what if you are actually addicted to your job?",,None,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Could working too hard and for too many hours be a form of addiction?

""My name is JC and I am a workaholic.""

JC, who lives in Tampa Bay, Florida, says she needed a lot of courage the first time she stood up and said that in front of a group of people she had never met before.

JC, who doesn't want us to reveal her full name, had gone along to a meeting of Workaholics Anonymous because she felt she couldn't cope anymore.

A 40-year-old healthcare worker, who had conquered her alcoholism and an eating disorder, she says she couldn't experience the serenity that she hoped sobriety would bring because she instead had become addicted to working.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption For many people securing a decent work/life balance is a tricky business

""I was constantly obsessed with work,"" she says. ""I realised I used work to numb out and avoid myself, my feelings and my fears.""

Her work addiction and the stress that came with it affected her health.

""I had premature grey hair within three months of starting a management position,"" she says. ""I experienced adrenal fatigue... I have a heart condition.""

Following a similar 12-step recovery plan to the one first devised by Alcoholics Anonymous, Workaholics Anonymous started in the US in the early 1980s.

Today there are more than 100 meeting groups around the world, from Argentina to the US, the UK and Japan. There is also the possibility of joining an online meeting via Skype or over the phone.

But how do you know if you are a workaholic? And what other ways are there to get help?

Wilmar Schaufeli, a professor of work and organisational psychology at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, describes a workaholic as ""a person who works obsessively hard in a compulsive way"".

Image copyright Jord Visser Image caption Wilmar Schaufeli says that Workaholics Anonymous works for many suffers, because they can realise they are not alone

""So it's a combination between excessive work and compulsive work, compulsive tendency.""

He adds that going to Workaholics Anonymous works for many sufferers because ""you see people who have the same problem, so you are not alone. I think this is an important thing for all kinds of behavioural problems or addictions.""

For other people with work addiction problems, having one-to-one therapy with a trained professional might be the answer.

But what actually can lead to work addition?

Dr Claudia Herbert, a clinical psychologist at the Oxford Development Centre, in Putney, Oxfordshire, often treats sufferers. She says that many workaholics have other mental health disorders.

""Lots of clients may feel depressed, they may actually think that life is a little bit empty, they may have anxiety problems, they may also have addictions to cope with.""

Image copyright Claudia Herbert Image caption Claudia Herbert says that many workaholics have other mental health problems

The condition can be triggered by someone having to work too hard in the first place. ""People often have to take jobs that in previous times would have been done by two or three people,"" she says.

Work addiction may be caused in part by a person being pushed too hard by his or her parents in their earlier life. ""People who as children were reinforced by their achievements rather than who they are, they are more likely to become work addicted,"" she adds.

When it comes to the types of jobs where people are more vulnerable to becoming workaholics, Prof Schaufeli says it is more a case of senior professionals rather than those with jobs on the lower rungs of the workplace ladder.

He says that self-employed people are also vulnerable because they can become obsessed by their businesses.

Prof Schaufeli adds that work addicts very often don't see that their behaviour is problematic because the fact they are doing vast amounts of work often means they are earning more and being promoted.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some workaholics are not said to recognise that anything is wrong because they have secured promotions and pay rises

When it comes to treating work addiction, Dr Herbert says it needs to be individually tailored to each sufferer, and getting to the bottom of what caused it.

At Retreat South, a rehabilitation centre and mental health retreat in the Australian state of Victoria, they run a work-related stress and executive burnout programme, trying to get people's work/life balance back.

The programme started six years ago, and the average length of stay is one month, with prices from 8,000 Australian dollars ($6,100; £4,400) per week.

Most of the clients are Australian, but they also have some from Asia and Europe.

""We work on the guilt - I haven't been a good parent, I haven't been a good partner,"" says Jane Enter, Retreat South's clinical director.

""People should reconnect to who they are, it's about getting a more balanced life.""

Back in Florida, JC - who first went to Workaholics Anonymous back in 2012 - now volunteers for the organisation.

""I have more time for fun and relationships with people,"" she says. ""I have the same job. However, because I have changed the way I think and act it is much more manageable.

Adrian Chiles 'horrified' at drinking 100 alcohol units a week,The TV and radio broadcaster revealed he sometimes drank more than 100 units a week.,,2018-08-21T10:03:38+00:00,"Image caption Presenter Adrian Chiles speaks about alcohol after revealing he sometimes drank 100 units a week.

Presenter Adrian Chiles has urged people to track their alcohol intake after revealing he sometimes drank 80 or 100 units a week.

The BBC 5 live host said it was ""horrifying"" to add up his alcohol consumption, which was well over the recommended weekly 14 units.

He was told by a doctor he ""can't carry on like this"" and his liver damage could cause cirrhosis or death.

Chiles, 51, has tackled the issue of drinking in a new BBC documentary.

Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Chiles said: ""I was just staggered what I was putting away"".

He said most of his drinking was ""completely mundane and harmless"", adding: ""I don't really get drunk, I don't misbehave, I don't drink during the day, I don't drink alone, I don't particularly stay up late.

""I just drink something every day.

""There are loads of us who just drink too much and I just wondered why I was so dependent on it in a small way, or is it a big way.""

Chiles' comments have prompted many people to speak about their own drinking habits. Actress Linda Robson told ITV's Loose Women she thought ""maybe I could have been on the way to being an alcoholic"" when she used to drink a bottle of wine a night.

She said: ""My big thing was because I didn't drink in the daytime then I didn't have a problem and I could make myself wait until that time every night so I obviously didn't have a problem.

""But I was still functioning, I was still coming into work.""

'We are the problem'

Chiles - who sees himself as a social drinker and not an alcoholic - said he wanted to make the programme after being interested in people's ideas of what type of drinking counts as alcoholism.

For the documentary, called Drinkers Like Us, the TV and radio broadcaster recorded how many units he was drinking.

In an interview with the Times, he said on one morning he calculated that he had drunk more than 100 units in the previous week, whereas other times his weekly amount was 80 units.

The NHS advises men and women not to drink more than 14 units a week - equivalent to six pints of average-strength beer or 10 small glasses of wine.

Chiles said people like him - the ""constant drinkers, the toppers up"" - are ""the problem"".

Although his blood tests were completely normal, a scan showed he had mild to moderate fibrosis of the liver - a type of damage that includes scar tissue forming - and significant liver fat.

The doctor told Chiles: ""You can't carry on like this. You're at risk of disease progression to cirrhosis, liver disease and failure - and death.""

Image caption In his documentary, Chiles is warned by a doctor: ""You can't carry on like this.""

Chiles said it might be easier to ""stop completely"" rather than moderating his drinking, which he said requires planning.

He said: ""I think middle-aged 'supposedly moderate' drinkers need to take a look at ourselves.

""I encourage anyone, don't judge yourself, don't panic you're not going to drop dead, but go on an app like 'Drink Less' and measure what you're drinking, be honest with yourself for three weeks.""

Presenter Adrian Chiles has urged people to track their alcohol intake after revealing he sometimes drank 80 or 100 units a week.
He said most of his drinking was ""completely mundane and harmless"", adding: ""I don't really get drunk, I don't misbehave, I don't drink during the day, I don't drink alone, I don't particularly stay up late.
For the documentary, called Drinkers Like Us, the TV and radio broadcaster recorded how many units he was drinking.

Sadie Frost says Mirror hacking caused 'living hell',"Actress Sadie Frost tells a hearing phone hacking by Mirror Group journalists made her life ""a living hell"" for many years.",,None,"Image copyright BBC Sport Image caption Frost said hacking by Mirror journalists affected her relationship with fellow actor Jude Law

Actress Sadie Frost has told the High Court that having her phone hacked by Mirror Group journalists made her life a ""living hell"".

Describing the experience as the ""lowest of the low"", the 49-year-old actress and businesswoman said she did not know who to trust.

In 2003, she had a breakdown and went into hospital, which was a ""terrible"" incident but ended up in the papers.

Ms Frost is among eight high-profile figures claiming damages for hacking.

She told the court: ""Your father is dying, you are going through divorce, you have postnatal depression, you are in and out of hospital, my baby was ill, he was born premature.

""I was at breaking point, I could not sleep, or eat, and I did not know who to trust as information kept getting into the media.

""I needed my loved ones around me. I was very upset, I was a very, very unhappy person.

""Every time I turned to someone to confide in them, it ended up in the newspapers, which added to my distress and trauma.""

""I couldn't go and sit with my mum and have a cup of tea because I thought she was selling stories. I didn't trust my own mother.""

'Panic attacks'

Ms Frost said her separation from fellow actor Jude Law was very difficult.

""I thought it might be Jude, trying to make me look bad for custody reasons, or my friends or family using me for their own gains. Either thought was heartbreaking.

""This was a deeply stressful time in my life and the fact my insecurities were being publicised obviously made it worse.""

She described how friends, particularly model Kate Moss, questioned whether they could trust her.

""Even worse than that, Jude, the father of my children, thought for years that I was selling stories which created an animosity between us that has only really disappeared since the revelations about phone hacking.""

Image caption Sadie Frost said she was 'humiliated' when a story emerged about her attending an AA meeting

Ms Frost said: ""I couldn't take my youngest son to the park for two years because he was photographed. He would cry and I would get panic attacks.

""I lost two to three years of my life, they wanted me to fail.

She told the hearing that it felt like she and those closest to her were ""being monitored and hunted down by a sort of secret police"".

""Every area of my life was affected. There was nowhere I could go that was safe.""

""If I went to the doctor or gynaecologist, details would be in the newspaper.""

'Embarrassed and humiliated'

Ms Frost said she was left ""incredibly embarrassed and humiliated"" when a story emerged about her attending an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

She said she had been advised to go a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous ""because it was a safe place"".

""Someone quite high-profile took me there and I went there after everyone said it would be safe and anonymous,"" she told the court.

""I was portrayed as troubled, sad, as a party-girl. That's not why people go to AA, they go there to get help and be in a safe place.""

She added: ""I was portrayed for so long as a complete mess that I have had to overcome people's perception of me to rebuild my reputation as a successful businesswoman. I can only guess at the position I would be in if none of this had happened.""

She said that the apology she had received from Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) was ""rather too little too late"".

The hearing at the High Court in London is considering what compensation should be paid by MGN to Ms Frost, alongside BBC creative director Alan Yentob, soap stars Shane Richie, Shobna Gulati and Lucy Taggart, former footballer Paul Gascoigne, TV producer Robert Ashworth and flight attendant Lauren Alcorn.","['hacking', 'caused', 'jude', 'mirror', 'life', 'hell', 'safe', 'frost', 'trust', 'told', 'went', 'living', 'thought', 'court', 'sadie']","Image copyright BBC Sport Image caption Frost said hacking by Mirror journalists affected her relationship with fellow actor Jude LawActress Sadie Frost has told the High Court that having her phone hacked by Mirror Group journalists made her life a ""living hell"".

Trending: Why Jim Wolf's makeover video went viral,A time-lapse makeover of a homeless US man has garnered more than 13 million YouTube hits in a week - but why do stories about the homeless gain such traction on social media? BBC Trending investigates.,,None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The two-hour make-over of a US Army veteran is shown in two minutes

A time-lapse makeover of a homeless US man has been watched more than 13 million times on YouTube in the past week.

In two minutes, former soldier Jim Wolf is shown making the transition from bearded and bedraggled to well-groomed and sharply-suited. Since then, the 54-year-old - who has long struggled against poverty, homelessness and alcoholism - has reportedly started to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and is now staying with his sister.

Producer Rob Bliss made the video to raise awareness and funds for a Grand Rapids homeless charity, Degage Ministries - which has received $50,000 (£30,000) in donations as a result.

Mr Wolf's is not the first story of this kind to gain such traction in social media networks. In September, donations of more than $110,000 (£70,000) poured in for Glen James, a homeless man in Boston who returned a lost bag containing £26,000 in cash and travellers cheques. Billy Ray Harris was able to buy himself a house in Kansas with £110,000 given by strangers touched by his honesty after he returned a £2,500 diamond ring accidentally dropped into his change cup earlier this year.

And in 2011, offers of radio work flooded in for Ted Williams after his smooth baritone was recorded by a local newspaper reporter who saw him asking for money by an Ohio roadside.

The release of the Jim Wolf video - timed to coincide with Veterans Day - has focused minds on the issue of homelessness. Even so, Mr Bliss, who makes viral videos for a living, described the response as ""pretty incredible"" - far outperforming any other content he has produced.

""The number one thing that makes a video likely to go viral is the feeling it creates,"" he told the BBC. ""The stronger that feeling, the more successful it will be.""

Alastair Murray, Project Director at Housing Justice, a UK-based Christian campaigning charity says the video reminds the audience of the possibility of losing a job, a home, and a stable life. ""This video helps people see the real person behind that bearded needy person about whom they feel awkwardness - there's a transformation into a person with whom you'd be happy to have a chat,"" he says.

Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission is taking the devolved government in Belfast to the high court over its refusal to reform the abortion law. The Commission wants a change in the law so that women and girls in Northern Ireland have the choice of accessing a termination of pregnancy in circumstances of serious foetal abnormality, rape or incest. What is the basis for their legal challenge?

Are you among the thousands of women who resolved to cut down or stop drinking for January? Or perhaps you're among those who're hoping to give up the booze for good? A new wave of clubs and websites is springing up to support the growing numbers of women who are worried about their alcohol intake, but how do they differ from Alcoholics Anonymous and can they really help?

This weekend a new exhibition exploring the legacy of one of the most important and controversial artists of modern times opens at the Norwich Castle art gallery. The French artist, Edouard Manet's provocative paintings of women scandalised the Paris art world, but they challenged traditional depictions of women, and paved the way for professional female artists of the early 20th century. We discuss the impact of his work.

Australian Author, Colleen McCullough, has died at the age of 77. Her most famous novel, The Thorn Birds, a story of an unlikely affair between a young woman and a priest, sold more than 30 million copies and became a successful mini-series. But how did she come to give up a promising career in neurophysiology to become one of Australia most famous and loved authors?

Serial drink-driver avoids jail 'for being a woman',A judge tells Victoria Parry she would have been sent straight to prison if she were a man.,,2019-04-12T18:51:44+00:00,"Image copyright Paul Beard Image caption If Victoria Parry had been a man ""it would have been straight down the stairs"" to prison, a judge said

A judge gave a serial drink-driver a chance to avoid jail because she is a woman.

Victoria Parry, 30, hit three other cars after downing a bottle of wine.

Judge Sarah Buckingham said Parry, an alcoholic who had escaped an abusive relationship, would have gone ""straight down the stairs"" to jail if she were a man.

Although Parry ""deserved"" a prison term, the judge gave her three months to address her issues.

The comments are being investigated by a judicial watchdog.

Prosecutor Tim Sapwell said Parry caught a van's rear bumper, a Vauxhall Insignia's wing mirror, then the side of a BMW ""very heavily"" in the crash.

'Shocking case'

He told Warwick Crown Court it caused her Fiat to spin off the A46 near Stratford-upon-Avon into a wooded area where it caught fire.

An off-duty police officer pulled her from the car, and Parry, who was banned from the road at the time, told him she had drunk a bottle of wine and ""shouldn't be driving"", Mr Sapwell said.

She was arrested, and registered a reading of almost three times the legal limit at a police station.

Lucy Tapper, defending, said Parry had a ""considerable drink problem"" after a 15-year abusive relationship, but had begun to tackle her alcohol intake.

The judge said: ""If Miss Parry was a man, there is no question it would have been straight down the stairs, because this is a shocking case of dangerous driving against a background of two previous convictions for excess alcohol.""

But, she said, the offence had been committed in May 2018, and Parry, who had admitted dangerous driving, had not been in trouble since.

""She has clearly got an alcohol problem. She is, whether she admits it or not, an alcoholic,"" the judge said.

Deferring sentencing for three months, judge Buckingham told Parry she ""richly deserved"" an immediate custodial term of 18 months.

""I want to see whether you can really address the issues rather than paying lip service,"" she said.

She ordered Parry to abstain from alcohol, attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and pay for private counselling.

If Parry complied, she said, the custody would not be made immediate.

""If you don't comply, I will conclude that you are not worthy of the chance,"" the judge added.

The Judicial Conduct Investigations Office confirmed it received a complaint about the remarks attributed to the judge.

The drama and successes of his life have been as remarkable off the pitch as on it. He found sporting glory despite being an alcoholic and even served time in prison for drink-driving. But his journey of recovery has been a remarkable one. He went back to studying, developed a love of literature and the arts and put his own money into a charity to support other sports men and women recovering from addiction. It's a transformation that his former team-mates have described as 'heroic'. Now, he is heading to Azerbaijan to become a manager, he is planning, he says, to build the Tony Adams team.

Gazza rehab: Paul Gascoigne reveals US clinic drama,Football star Paul Gascoigne reveals he thought he was going to die during his most recent spell in rehab in the US.,,None,"Image caption Concerns for Gascoigne's wellbeing were raised again earlier this year

Football star Paul Gascoigne has revealed he thought he was going to die during his most recent spell in rehab.

The former England midfielder has flown back to the UK after more than a month at a clinic in Phoenix, Arizona, that specialises in treating alcoholism.

The 45-year-old told the Sun newspaper that he heard three doctors conclude he was going to pass away, before he slipped into a three-day coma.

His life was saved, but Gascoigne said: ""I thought I was on my way out.""

Fresh fears for the health of Gascoigne, who has battled against alcoholism for several years, emerged at a public appearance in Northampton in January.

'Total wreck'

Within days, he had been flown to the private clinic in the US and Gascoigne - nicknamed Gazza - said he begged its doctors at the clinic to save his life as he went through the detox process.

Alcohol addiction When someone becomes dependent or addicted to alcohol, they: Develop a strong sense of compulsion to drink

May drink shortly after waking to reduce feelings of alcohol withdrawal

Develop a reduced capacity to control how often and how much they drink

Organise their lifestyle around drinking

Continue to drink despite physical or social problems Source: BBC Health The long-term effects of alcohol

""Three doctors didn't think I would make it,"" he said.

""It has got to inspire me to never let this happen again. I've come through that - death. I was dead.""

He added: ""I thought I was on my way out. I looked like a corpse. I was a total wreck.""

Gascoigne, whose football clubs included Newcastle United, Tottenham, Lazio, Rangers and Everton, has had a long-term battle against alcohol addiction.

He said his latest problems started in Dubai last summer when he started drinking alcohol again after 17 months ""dry"". The ex-footballer said he followed that by staying off alcohol for the following six months, but his own despair at his lapse meant that he failed to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and isolated himself, barely eating. ""I was living like a dry drunk,"" he said.

Eventually, he succumbed and started drinking heavily again, a situation which came to public attention at the Northampton charity event when he broke down sobbing on stage.

On his admission to the US treatment centre, Gascoigne's management company said he was alcoholic with ""complex issues"" which were being dealt with by professionals.

It has since emerged that the public appearance could still raise thousands of pounds for charity.

Gascoigne said he had no recollection of being there.

'Another chance'

Gascoigne's drinking problems started during his playing days - he was admitted to the Priory Hospital, near Southampton, in 1998, shortly after his divorce from wife Sheryl.

Three years later, while playing at Everton, Gascoigne admitted himself to an alcohol rehabilitation clinic in Arizona on the insistence of his then manager Walter Smith.

In 2008, four years after retiring, he was arrested in Newcastle and detained under the Mental Health Act.

He was later sectioned following reports that he was acting strangely in Hemel Hempstead.

More recently he has been treated at The Priory again and at the Providence Projects treatment centre in Bournemouth.

Gascoigne told the Sun that the way forward for him now was to start attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings again.

""Meetings are really important. I was too weak, I stopped going to them. I have to start going.

""I should be dead. The doctors said I would not make it. But I'm here, I have another chance - and I'm going to take it.""","['drama', 'problems', 'alcohol', 'way', 'clinic', 'going', 'gascoigne', 'rehab', 'gazza', 'public', 'doctors', 'reveals', 'paul', 'started', 'thought']","Image caption Concerns for Gascoigne's wellbeing were raised again earlier this yearFootball star Paul Gascoigne has revealed he thought he was going to die during his most recent spell in rehab.

Running changed former British soldier's life,Gary Edwards wants to inspire others and helped set up a weekly free 5km running event.,,None,"Image copyright Great Run Local Image caption Gary Edwards said turning to running was ""probably the best thing I could have done""

A former soldier who turned to alcohol, piled on the pounds and then shed 12 stone (76kg) has said he wants to inspire others to take up running.

Gary Edwards, 52, was medically discharged from the Army after a truck crash in Germany in 1992.

He suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and his weight increased to 25 stone (159kg).

He used running to get his life ""back on track"" and has helped set up a new fun run at Alton Water, in Suffolk.

Mr Edwards had served in the Royal Corps of Signals for 10 years when the crash happened, which left him with crush injuries to his legs and abdomen, which required part of his intestine to be removed.

Shortly after losing his military career, his son Christopher died from a brain haemorrhage.

He said he ""fell apart mentally and physically"" and turned to alcohol to ""numb the pain"".

Image copyright Family Photo Image caption Mr Edwards said he turned to alcohol to ""numb the pain"" and saw his weight grow to 25 stone

Mr Edwards, who has two daughters, attended an alcoholics anonymous meeting six years ago, decided his life had to change and he started running.

He said turning to running was ""probably the best thing I could have done"".

Following a trial period at Holbrook Academy, Mr Edwards, of Shotley Gate near Ipswich, has now helped to set up and lead the new free 5km (3.1-mile) Great Run Local Alton Water.

He said: ""Quitting the booze also meant that I started losing weight.

""I was now wanting to get fitter and healthier and to become the man, the dad and the husband I wanted to be.""

Boy George has become a patron of Focus 12, the drug and alcohol rehabilitation charity based in Suffolk.

The singer and DJ said he wanted to spread the word that help is available for people who are struggling with addiction, and to their families.

""The important thing is for people to know there is a way out of it - there's Focus 12, NA (Narcotics Anonymous) and AA (Alcoholics Anonymous),"" he said.

Russell Brand and Davina McCall are also patrons of Focus 12.

Bury St Edmunds-based Focus 12 chief executive Chip Somers said 19 drug and alcohol rehabilitation charities had closed in the UK in the past 20 months.

He said the support and publicity provided by the patrons had kept Focus 12 running.

Boy George, whose real name is George O'Dowd, made his name with Culture Club and has himself battled with drug addiction.

""It did used to be something that was associated with music and celebrities, but nowadays it's so widespread,"" he said.

Can a parent save their child from addiction?,The death of Amy Winehouse has once again highlighted the danger of drink and drug addiction. The struggles of Mitch and Janis Winehouse to cure their daughter of her addiction are shared by thousands of couples up and down the country.,,None,"Image caption In the film Trainspotting, Renton (Ewan McGregor) is put through ""cold turkey"" by his parents

The death of Amy Winehouse has once again highlighted the danger of drink and drug addiction. Mitch and Janis Winehouse's battles to cure their daughter of her addiction are shared by thousands of parents up and down the country.

Many parents reading of the death at the weekend of singer Amy Winehouse will have thought to themselves: ""What would I do if my son or daughter was an addict?""

Some people, like Tom Methven, know only too well what they would do and whether it would work.

His son, Jason, 29, is an alcoholic.

Mr Methven, from Surrey, said: ""When I heard about Amy Winehouse I thought, 'It's finally got her'.

'Slave to the addiction'

""Drugs and alcohol damage a receptor in the brain. You become a slave. Why else would she have kept taking it? She was a very similar age to my son.""

Hannah Meredith was 17 when she died of a heroin overdose in October 2009.

Image caption Teenager Hannah Meredith wrote a ""letter to heroin"" a month before her death in 2009

A month before she died, she wrote a ""letter to heroin"". Her aunt, Lisa Moore, read out excerpts from the letter on BBC Radio Five Live last year.

Ms Moore told the BBC: ""It takes years to recover but it only takes seconds to relapse.""

She said: ""We heard about Amy Winehouse's death on Saturday and it brought back feelings of what happened to Hannah. It was two years ago, but it's still raw.""

Ms Moore said: ""I've read stuff on Facebook about Amy like 'one less junkie', and it is so ignorant and insensitive. Families feel helpless, they feel like failures, they think, 'How can we fix it when that person is choosing to do it'?""

""What people don't realise is that no matter how badly someone is on drugs nothing ever prepares you for the knock on the door or the phone call, nothing prepares you for their death.""

She said Hannah had been given an ecstasy tablet on her 14th birthday, ""liked the feeling"" and by the age of 15 was on heroin.

Two years later she was ""clean"" but then had her fatal relapse.

""She had been in recovery for four months and was sure she was in control of heroin. She might have thought she would try it one more time,"" said Ms Moore.

Both Ms Moore and Mr Methven said there was a lot of ignorance about substance abuse.

Tough love

They said many people thought they could just lock their son or daughter in a room and make them go ""cold turkey"" - completely denying them drink or drugs - to exorcise their demons.

The cold turkey scene has cropped up in films like Trainspotting and soap operas like EastEnders, where a parent uses so-called ""tough love"".

But Mr Methven says the reality is that it very rarely works.

He has tried almost everything to rescue his son from his alcoholism:

Rehab - two sessions in a £500-a-day private clinic.

Medication - Antabuse, or disulfiram, a tablet which makes the taker sick if he or she drinks alcohol.

Sectioning - a compulsory week in a mental health unit.

Psychiatry - several sessions with a top specialist.

Image caption Mitch and Janis Winehouse had to deal with their daughter's addiction amid the public's gaze

At his worst point Jason, who weighs 19 stone (120kg), was drinking huge quantities of vodka and would become violent and aggressive.

""One time he smashed a piece of glass at his girlfriend's house and cut an artery. I had to follow the trail of blood to find him. They broke up about a month later. She couldn't cope with it,"" said Mr Methven.

He said: ""Another time he was self-harming. He burned himself with an iron and was then banging his head against a table.

""He tried to cut his wrists once with a knife. The police were called and he was taken to hospital.

""He was so drunk he was fighting with the security guards and he got one of them, a big guy, on the floor. Eventually he was given a very strong tranquilliser.""

Mr Methven said his son, who is an only child, had a normal childhood and was very intelligent.

He went to university and got a first with honours before embarking on a PhD.

Out of control

But his drinking, which had started as a teenager, got out of control and he never completed it.

Jason is now unemployed and gets £20 a week in Disability Living Allowance.

""That is supposed to be given to his mum for laundry and shopping but it is in many respects money for alcohol,"" said his father.

Mr Methven said: ""He was about 24 when we realised he had a real problem. We went to the doctor and got a referral.

""We wanted to get him into rehab but it took so long on the NHS that we panicked and went private.""

Jason has been into rehab twice.

There is no alcohol in the house now. I used to have some good quality wine. It was very well hid. I was going to give it to a friend as a present but it was gone. He had drunk it John Methven, Father of an alcoholic

On one occasion Mr Methven spent £18,000 and he said: ""Before the cheque was even dry he was back on the drink.""

He said: ""There is no alcohol in the house now. I used to have some good-quality wine. It was very well hid. I was going to give it to a friend as a present but it was gone. He had drunk it.""

Mr Methven said his son had stolen money from him and his wife and had also taken DVDs and other property and sold it at cash converter shops to provide drinking money.

'Secretive' drinking

""It's always secretive drinking. He doesn't go to the pub. He just drinks in his room. He hid it in rucksacks or under the hedge in the garden,"" he said.

Jason has now joined Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and has a sponsor, but he is still drinking.

""He is trying to take it down. Yesterday he had six cans (of beer) and today it's four. He is still drinking but it's far less,"" said Mr Methven.

But he said the crucial thing was that Jason has now said he wants to stop.

Image caption Nicholas Mills (pictured) hanged himself after a drug-fuelled argument but his twin brother survived and is now clean

""If they are going to get well they have got to go to AA or NA (Narcotics Anonymous). The individual is powerless, but collectively they can do it. It's a spiritual thing. AA is about giving it up altogether.

""Once you are an alcoholic or an addict one is too many and 100 is not enough.""

Asked how he feels about his son now, he said: ""It's not so much shame as disappointment about what he could have done with his life.""

While Mr Methven can understand the addiction, Elizabeth Burton-Phillips knows the heartbreak of what she calls the ""double whammy"" of addiction and death.

Her twin sons, Nicholas and Simon, both became heroin addicts.

Nicholas died in 2004 but Simon survived and has kicked the habit.

Mrs Burton-Phillips, from Buckinghamshire, has since set up a charity, DrugFam, and she told the BBC: ""We are trying to help families who are struggling to cope with the addiction of their loved ones, like Amy and my son.""

She said she met Amy's mother in 2008 and added: ""I have been in text contact with her since Amy passed and they are obviously going to be terribly badly affected.""

Mrs Burton-Phillips travelled to Llanelli on Monday to give her moral support to the Hannah Meredith Foundation, which launched a support group for the families of those in the Carmarthenshire area coping with substance abuse.

Anyone wanting to contact the foundation should do so through their Facebook page.

My Zinc Bed press pack: David Hare,Press Packs,,None,"My Zinc Bed: a compelling adaptation of David Hare's acclaimed play for BBC Two

Interview with David Hare, writer, My Zinc Bed



What would you say are the central themes of My Zinc Bed?

My Zinc Bed is really a study about the arguments about alcoholism. I suppose I knew a lot of friends who were in AA [Alcoholics Anonymous], and because of that I was interested in those arguments about whether alcoholism is a genetically inherited condition that you can do nothing about, and in which you have to surrender your will and treat it as one would treat any other disease – and the argument of AA of rational recovery. AA is an organisation that believes that only by mastering your addiction by willpower can you live a fulfilled life. This seemed to me an extraordinarily interesting argument and that's what I wanted to write about.

I was also interested in the question of why addiction is such a contemporary subject. We hear about it all the time now – be it addiction to shopping, dieting, alcohol, drugs, work – it seems very much to have replaced belief. Addiction has taken the place of ideology. When I was young people discussed what they believed and what their ideas were – those ideas were the ideas which shaped their lives. Now young people discuss the things to which they are addicted. So the whole subject of addiction seems to me quite contemporary and near the bone.

How did the television version of the play come about?

It's often said of my stage writing that it's filmic – a series of fast-moving scenes that are physically realised – and when we did the play at the Royal Court Theatre in 2000 it seemed obviously filmic.

At the time that I wrote the stage play it was very much the cusp of the internet, and the arrival of all that new cyber business – but that stuff over the years seemed rather too dated. So there was a way of looking at it a few years later – to focus on the basic fable, about whether you can ever be in control of your own recovery, indeed whether anybody can really be in control of their own life, that seemed to become much stronger.

It was actually my agent Jenne Casarotto who proposed to HBO the idea that it was time to try and regenerate the single film a little on TV again, and that maybe some plays from the theatre could be adapted once more for television. There's a quite extraordinary experiment going on at the moment in France whereby a major television channel regularly transmits plays live from Paris theatres, and contrary to all conventional modern broadcasting thinking they're getting huge audiences and massive success with these transmissions. This is a small-scale experiment I suppose, to try and get some individual films specially made on the BBC.

It's nice to remind people that it's possible to do interesting things, and particularly if you've got very very good actors like Jonathan Pryce, Uma Thurman, Paddy Considine. You know Uma Thurman doesn't do many television plays – she's doing it obviously because she thinks there's something interesting about it.

How did you go about adapting your stage play for the screen, were there any particular challenges involved?

It was incredibly easy, and it's very rare that you say that! I normally hate adapting my plays for the cinema, and I've done a few adaptations of my plays for cinema. By and large I refuse to do them, mostly because I find it very difficult to reconceive things for new medium. But this has a very strong story about how a rather indigent poet gets picked up by a couple of rich people and spends a summer with them, and then gets passed aside by them. Films adapt more easily when they're like short stories, and in a way it took me back to the plays that I used to write for television in the Seventies like Licking Hitler and Dreams of Leaving, which were very much like short stories, novellas almost – and that's a beautiful form for television.

Can you describe the three characters?

Victor is an entrepreneur who is an ex-communist. Like a lot of people of that hippy generation he then became a businessman and swung all the way from the left-wing ideas of his youth to playing at capitalism with immense success. So he's someone who both has a philosophical hold on capitalism but also is a player within the system. He's picked up, if you like, by capitalism, made rich, then stripped of his money in the course of the drama.

Victor's wife, Uma Thurman's character Elsa, is an alcoholic who is trying to recover through rational recovery. The young poet Paul, played by Paddy Considine, is an alcoholic who is trying to do it the other way, through AA.

Victor claims to be the only person who isn't an alcoholic in the film but by his behaviour you might think he's as much an alcoholic as Elsa and Paul are.

What research did you do for the original play?

I went to some AA meetings, I a read a lot of the stuff about it. AA meetings are very welcoming and open. I know when the play happened at the Royal Court it was much discussed by AA meetings – a lot of people at meetings in London were saying 'have you seen this play, it's really interesting because it's a philosophical discussion of what our problems are and what the problem of addiction is'. So it came out of that. I did do a lot of research but truthfully it was more through watching the agonies of some friends of mine.

Were you involved in the casting process at all?

Jonathan Pryce was sort of self-selecting! He's always been one of the foremost actors of my generation. I first worked with him in 1973, and he's just an exceptional film actor – you can't imagine anybody better to play the role.

Paddy I didn't know at all, he came to the film, as he put it, never having had to speak long lines before. He'd always appeared in films where he was required to be violent, or moody, and has created a really extraordinary body of work. With my plays there is always a sense immediately whether the actor can say the dialogue or not because I write a certain kind of dialogue that is quite technically demanding and is not naturalistic. Paddy took to that like a fish to water, and I think surprised himself by the ease with which he could play the role – mainly because he'd never been asked to play that kind of part before. He's a writer as well so therefore was a wonderful person to play a poet.

Uma I've known since she was 18 or 19, I first saw her work when she began a film about Dylan Thomas in the late Eighties. We've always known she was a very good actress but again she might say she hasn't always been required to show that side of her.

And yet that's exactly what happened to Bernard Hare, who has been recalling the experience of going down a pit in Methley, a village near Castleford. The value of that trip underground would only dawn on him years later.

#BBCtrending: Bello! The UCL students spammed by their president,"An email simply reading 'bello' triggered 3,000 replies, and gave birth to a new meme.",,None,"Image copyright @punderachiever

When students at a leading London university were sent a mysterious email from a senior official, the #Bellogate meme was born.

Students at University College London were sent an email last night, purportedly from the university president, Michael Arthur. It simply contained a one word greeting - ""bello"". By the morning, the message had generated a gigantic email thread, with some students waking up to almost 3,000 unread messages.

The hashtag was the top trend on Twitter overnight in the UK, with more than 5,000 tweets using the term since the ""Bello"" email appeared. Many shared emails generated in the thread - in which students continued spamming each other with jokes and puns. ""Bello? Is it me you're looking for"", read one - a play on a Lionel Ritchie song. Others sent invites to cyber security courses, and appealed for missing items of stationery. Some reported they had been signed up to porn sites, dating companies, Alcoholics Anonymous and Sarah Palin's website. A parody account soon emerged.

Most seemed to see the funny side. ""Ooo we all just got signed up to the Miley Cyrus mailing list. #Bellogate #BelloCameInLikeAWreckingBall"", the UCL Cheesegrater magazine tweeted. One PhD student wrote: ""The funniest thing happened to UCL in years, can't stop laughing."" While some have questioned UCL's security policies, and expressed frustration about having to delete hundreds of unwanted messages, the sharpest criticism was directed at students who kept posting to the thread, by hitting ""reply all"" to the original email.

UCL has apologised for ""multiple emails"" received by students, and shut down the mailing list concerned. It is not known yet who was responsible, although some have jokingly pointed the finger at UCL's rival, King's College. President Arthur has so far remained silent on the matter.

Former alcoholic 'scared' by rise in young drinkers,"A recovering alcoholic from Norfolk says he is ""scared"" by the rise in the number of young people with drink problems.",,None,"Image caption Recovering alcoholic Patrick Martin is 'scared' by the rise in the number of young drinkers

A recovering alcoholic from Norfolk says he is ""scared"" by the rise in the number of young people with drink problems at his support group.

Patrick Martin, 64, once drank a litre of vodka a day at the height of his alcohol addiction.

Mr Martin, who has been sober for three years, has lost two partners to alcohol-related illnesses.

Now he is worried by the rise in the number of young people at his Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

""We are getting more young people at meetings, particularly young women,"" he said.

""They are getting really ill through drinking and it scares me for future generations.

""My heart goes out to them. I wish I could tell them what I've been through.""

'Wallowed in sadness'

Mr Martin, who lives in Norwich, said he has seen a sharp rise in young people aged between 22 to 28 coming to the group.

I just locked the door, drew the curtains, pulled the telephone wire out and just wallowed in my own sadness Patrick Martin

Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show the rate of alcohol-related deaths for 15 to 34-year-olds in the UK has almost doubled in nearly 20 years.

In 1991, 137 young people aged between 15 and 34 died of alcohol-related problems. Of those, 48 were women.

By 2009, the total number of alcohol-related deaths had risen to 261, of which 94 were women.

""The stories we hear from these young people are harrowing to say the least,"" Mr Martin said.

""They let their hair down at weekends but these weekends tend to get out of hand for a lot of them.""

Mr Martin said his drink problem started to escalate in his late 20s, when he drank as a way to escape the pressure he felt in his work as a pottery designer.

At the height of his addiction, Mr Martin said would sometimes go without eating for two weeks when on a drinking binge.

""I just locked the door, drew the curtains, pulled the telephone wire out and just wallowed in my own sadness,"" he said.

""When you are drinking, your only thoughts from the moment you wake up until the moment you pass out is where you can get your next drink from. Nothing else matters.""

'Rock bottom'

Mr Martin said his alcohol problem has shortened his life and robbed him of his marriage and his relationship with his son.

Two former partners have also died of alcohol-related illnesses in the past six years, he added.

Despite attending Alcoholics Anonymous for almost 30 years, Mr Martin said he decided to stop drinking quite suddenly three-and-a-half years ago.

""I just put the drink down one day,"" he said. ""I had reached my rock bottom and climbed back up but a lot of people don't.""

Mr Martin, who has now retired for health reasons, is calling for better education to help stem the rising tide of young drinkers.

""You are not going to stop people drinking by putting alcohol prices up,"" he said.

""If you are desperate for alcohol, you will steal to get it.

""I don't think the health services or Government take the problem seriously enough or realise how serious it will be in a few years.

""If they carry on drinking, a lot of these young people will be in the same boat as me in 10 years time.""","['alcoholrelated', 'drink', 'scared', 'alcohol', 'young', 'drinkers', 'rise', 'drinking', 'number', 'mr', 'problem', 'martin', 'alcoholic']","Image caption Recovering alcoholic Patrick Martin is 'scared' by the rise in the number of young drinkersA recovering alcoholic from Norfolk says he is ""scared"" by the rise in the number of young people with drink problems at his support group.

Hooked on alcohol,Three alcoholics share their experience of addiction and treatment at Sunderland's Lazarus centre.,,2005-03-30 00:00:00,"Andrea is an alcoholic. She's been going through a re-hab programme at the Lazarus Centre in Sunderland for the past 10 weeks. She's in her late 20s and her drinking became a problem about six years ago.

Andrea's story Andrea's story

""It started when I met my husband. He's a violent person, not that I'm with him now. I started drinking to look as if I was happy.

""I knew there was a problem: I had to have it. I was drinking between four to six cans and half a bottle of vodka a day"".

Things got worse. Andrea had separated from her husband by now, but Social Services knew about her problems.

""Social Services were going to make orders to take the children, to have them removed if I didn't change my ways, change my drinking, but I just couldn't stop. Even the thought of the children going into care didn't stop me"".

""It's a cycle - you get up, drink, pass out, wake up, drink."" Keith Family troubles

Her two young daughters were eventually taken into care. Andrea's hoping that if she gets through the programme, she will eventually get them back, but she knows she can't leave the Lazarus Centre until both she and her social worker are confident she won't lapse back into drinking.

""At the moment, they don't want to put me back into society - it might trigger me off into going for a drink again. I've got the children to think about - the court date is soon. I want to prove to the judge and the court that I've stopped drinking"".

Andrea knows she can never have an alcoholic drink again.

""It's the first drink - once you have that, the cravings come back and you want another and another, and it just leads you back down that road again. I've wasted five years of my life on drink"".

Help and treatment

The Lazarus Centre uses a 12-step programme developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, but in group sessions, and all the clients are residential for the course of their treatment, which can last from three months to a year.

As clients start to progress and realise they want to change their lives, they are allowed home at weekends, but random alcohol tests mean that if they do lapse, they have to leave the programme. The centre claims a high success rate for those who do stay the course.

Keith's story Keith's story

Keith hasn't had a drink for over two years now. He went through the programme at the Lazarus Centre, and now works there looking after the maintenance of the building.

With some distance from his lowest point, he is able to look back with a great deal of self-knowledge.

""I could go through a bottle and a half of vodka a day and eight to ten cans. It's a cycle - you get up, drink, pass out, wake up, drink.

""It's alright people saying it's a question of willpower - it goes beyond that. It's addiction in the true sense of the word.

""I begged a doctor to section me. You reach a point - rock bottom - when you're so desperate to get out of it you'll do anything. It's either that or die"".

Andy's battle

Andy has just joined the programme at the Lazarus Centre after ending up in hospital in April. He's been battling with drink for 15 years. Now that he's finally admitted he has a problem, he can see the bizarre logic he used to apply to his life.

Andy's story ""I don't smoke because it's bad for you, but I'll drink a bottle and a half of whisky. I don't take drugs because I know I have a compulsive nature.

""But this is the good one - I don't take paracetamol because someone told me they damage your liver. So when I had a headache coming out of an alcohol stupor, I wouldn't take paracetamol in case I hurt my liver. After 30 bottles of Scotch!""

The Have your say section is now closed, but here are some of your comments:

James

Lots of material on alcoholism seems to be blaming someone or something for 'triggering' the addiction. I believe my alcoholism was a latent disease waiting to be 'triggered' by my first drink. So much treatment is centred around a defined period of time - sign up, do treatment, signed off cured. My experience is that alcoholics and addicts for that matter, need the support of a twelve step programme and other recovering people for the rest of their lives. Relapse rates are very high with this support and without it alcoholics seem to often slide back into active addiction. 'Professionals are often well intentioned but nothing helps an alcoholic like another recovering alcoholic. This is how I have stayed sober for more than 8 years.

Gavin Ackroyd

The recent statistics that have prompted tonights news story are the affect of past drinking habits, not recent ones. You don't drink heavily for a few months and then die, it is the result of past drinking habits, take Andy's story he has been ""battling with drink for 15 years"". People should look at the bigger picture.

Project5000

I know that there are many differnt reasons why people drink excessively. We are a pub culture and this has got to change. There has to be an alternative. This is why there is a group of us who have set up a compnay to create a non-alcoholic bar for young people 12-25 years. All we need is a property that is as attractive as a pub and off course the money.

Lars von Trier unsure over film future,Danish film director Lars von Trier fears he will not make any more films now he is no longer taking drugs or drinking alcohol.,,None,"Image copyright AP Image caption Born Lars Trier, he added the Von while at the National Film School of Denmark

Danish film director Lars von Trier fears he will not make any more films now he is no longer taking drugs or drinking alcohol.

The controversial film-maker, whose films include Nymphomaniac and Breaking the Waves, revealed his concerns in an interview with Danish paper Politiken.

He told the broadsheet he no longer drank a bottle of vodka a day or took ""narcotics"".

""I don't know whether I can make more films. And that haunts me,"" he said.

""No creative expression of artistic value has ever been carried out by former alcoholics and drug addicts,"" Von Trier told the newspaper.

It was his first interview since Cannes Film Festival organisers banned him from their event in 2011 after he joked he was a Nazi at a news conference to promote his science fiction film Melancholia.

Von Trier said he was 90 days sober on Sunday, adding he attended meetings at Alcoholics Anonymous every day.

Palme d'Or

He was quoted by the newspaper as saying he used to drink a bottle of vodka every day but to be creative he combined the alcohol with different kinds of drugs.

""I can't recommend anyone to do the same. It is very dangerous and stupid in every way,"" he said.

The director is perhaps best known as a co-signatory of the Dogme 95 manifesto - a ""vow of chastity"" he made with three fellow Danish film-makers.

Their films, they declared, would strip away artifice by being shot on location using natural light and handheld cameras.

In 2000 Von Trier won the Palme d'Or with Dancer in the Dark, a musical starring Icelandic pop star Bjork as a woman who ends up on Death Row.

His other films include Dogville, Manderlay and 2009's Antichrist, which whipped up a furore at Cannes with its explicit sex scenes and graphic violence.

Von Trier's most recent effort, the lengthy and sexually-explicit Nymphomaniac Director's Cut - Volume I and II, has been nominated for best film at the European Film Awards.

The awards will be handed out on 13 December in Riga, Latvia, this year's European Capital of Culture.

FA Cup: Ex-Everton midfielder George Green on self-destruction and depression,"He was once compared to Wayne Rooney before a cocaine addiction saw George Green go from a Â£110,000-a-year midfielder to Â£80-a-game at Ossett Albion.",,2018-09-22 19:48:45,"Everton's George Green, then aged 17, tackles Liverpool's Seyi Ojo in an Under-18 game in November 2013

It is October 2011 and 15-year-old George Green is travelling to London for a trial with Tottenham Hotspur when a phone call changes everything. Everton have agreed a £2m deal with Bradford City for the schoolboy midfielder.

Green signs a two-and-a-half-year contract, receives a £45,000 signing-on fee in three instalments of £15,000, and a promising future with the Toffees beckons for the Dewsbury teenager.

Four years later he is standing on railway tracks near his hometown waiting for the next train so that he can end his life, Green's hopes of making it as a Premier League player ruined by cocaine and alcohol.

""I was in that much debt, I thought I'd lost my partner because of my drug use, and I didn't see a way back for me with football,"" the 22-year-old told BBC Sport.

Now at sixth-tier Chester, who beat City of Liverpool 4-0 in the FA Cup second qualifying round on Saturday, Green opens up about having too much too soon, self-destruction, depression and how he is attempting to rebuild his life.

""Mental health and addiction is an everyday battle. I'm giving it my best shot,"" he says. ""If others can learn from it, I'd rather help.""

'A £2,000-a-month cocaine addiction'

It was Everton Under-21s boss David Unsworth who broke the news to a tearful Green, then aged 19, he was no longer required after a loan at League Two Tranmere Rovers in 2015.

He had arrived at Goodison Park a fresh-faced schoolboy and was quickly compared to Wayne Rooney, who made his senior debut for the club aged 16.

Green left without playing a first-team game having spent five weeks of his four years at Goodison Park in London's Priory hospital, which provides a range of mental health and addictions treatments.

""Everton paid for it all, I think it was about £5,000-a-week,"" said Green, who was playing in the Toffees' U21 side by the age of 16 alongside future England internationals John Stones and Ross Barkley.

""Before I turned 18 you wouldn't catch me out at night. As soon as I was 18 it was like a new world opened up. I was drinking, doing drugs and playing football.

""The first time I took drugs I'd gone to watch football in a pub with mates. I was offered cocaine and it changed my life.""

At first Green was able to hide his habit from the likes of Kevin Sheedy, his youth-team coach, but before long he was taking 30 grams a month and life was spiralling out of control.

""I was spending way over £2,000 a month. I remember one particular Monday morning I was supposed to be training. I didn't wake up until the afternoon.

""The night before I'd gone to a friend's house for drink and drugs. I think that's when alarm bells started ringing at Everton.

""I remember phoning a welfare officer at Everton one night. I was crying and said 'I need help'. Soon after I was admitted to the Priory.""

Drugs and alcohol took a toll on Green. Here he is aged 19 signing for non-league Ossett Albion five months after being released by Everton

'I've earned £500,000 - I've got an iPad to show for it'

Having joined Everton as a £150-a-week schoolboy, Green's earnings reached £110,000-a-year at the Premier League club.

Since leaving three years ago, he has also had spells with Burnley and Oldham Athletic - as well as Viking in Norway's top flight under Englishman Ian Burchnall, now boss at Swedish side Ostersunds.

Green, who has also featured in the Scottish Premiership for Kilmarnock, believes he has earned at least £500,000 playing football.

""I have an iPad to show for it. That's how much of a downfall my life has become because of drugs,"" he added.

""I squandered it all. I'm embarrassed.""

At Everton, the former England youth international did most of his socialising back home in Yorkshire.

""A good night out? I'd easily spend about £1,500. A meal would cost between £200 and £300,"" he said.

""I'd be like 'let's get a bottle of champagne' and then a girl would come and sit next to me and I'd be like 'would you like a bottle of champagne?'

""Earning the money I was, I thought it was never going to end.

""Everybody wanted to know who I was and I was enjoying life. But I never got introduced to people who would keep me on the straight and narrow. They drank or did drugs and I fell into that circle.

""I got a brand new Mercedes-Benz A-Class and did about £4,000 damage to it. That stemmed from drink-driving. I was ridiculous, I used to drink-drive everywhere.""

Before he turned 18 and problems with drink and drugs, Green (centre) was compared to Wayne Rooney

'It wasn't my time to go'

Green had four clubs within 14 months of leaving Everton. Soon after his release from the Toffees, he joined League One Oldham on a two-year deal. He lasted five months before his contract was cancelled by mutual consent in November 2015.

""It was due to drink and drugs, I'd fallen out of love with the game and decided I didn't want to play any more.""

By now, Green was on a downward spiral. He had a drink-driving conviction and, after blowing much of his earnings on alcohol and cocaine, he was struggling financially. In addition, he was suffering from depression.

He did not stay away from football for long.

A week after leaving Oldham, Green had signed for non-league Yorkshire side Ossett Albion for £80-a-game. He had gone from Everton to the eighth tier of English football in less than six months.

It was around this time he first contemplated suicide.

Green (second left) celebrates scoring for Tranmere Rovers in a League Two game against AFC Wimbledon in March 2015

""Leaving Everton hit me hard,"" he said. ""I was stood on a railway track close to Mirfield station near Dewsbury ready for a train to come. I remember it being around eight or nine o'clock at night.

""I hadn't written a note. It was all the pressures of everything in my life. The drugs, the alcohol, my mental health, football wasn't going well, lack of money.

""Then there was an announcement over the speakers that the next train was delayed.

""I thought 'it must be a sign that it can't be my time to go'. I broke down in tears and walked away.""

Green's mental health problems continued. He took an overdose after joining Salford City on loan from Burnley in early 2017.

""I went in the pill cupboard at home and took everything there was. I wanted to die at that time,"" he added.

Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville, Salford's co-owner, offered his support.

Green said: ""I was invited round to his house. I had been in hospital for taking too many tablets. We spoke for an hour about football and things Salford could do to help me.""

Five months clean and a baby on the way

He lives near Dewsbury with his two-year-old daughter Daisy and fiancee, Charli, while the couple are due to welcome a baby boy to the family in October.

Gone are the flash cars and the hangers-on who formed part of his life when he was at Everton.

Instead of a Mercedes-Benz A-Class, Green now drives a Kia Rio to and from Chester, the club he joined in July from National League North rivals Nuneaton.

Money is tight but the player blames no-one but himself.

Green is rebuilding his life with fiancee Charli and two-year-old daughter Daisy

He relapsed in April but says he has not touched drink or drugs since, and attends weekly Alcoholics Anonymous and Cocaine Anonymous meetings.

Green's support network includes former Aston Villa and England defender Gary Charles, a recovering alcoholic who now has a business which provides care to people who are experiencing a wide range of problems, including depression and alcohol/drug dependency.

""There's not a day I don't speak to him. He's a lifesaver,"" adds Green.

'Without football, I'd be dead'

At the time of this interview, Green has an additional battle in his life. Two months after signing, he has yet to make his Chester debut because of a back injury which is likely to require surgery. He's frustrated and impatient.

He has kept himself busy by getting to know Chester fans at home games, signing autographs and posing for pictures.

Chester, a fan-owned club with a community trust, run a weekly mental health and wellbeing session which offers vulnerable members of society a chance to get out and play football.

Green hopes opening up about his problems will raise awareness of mental health and addiction issues.

Green has yet to play for his new club Chester because of a back problem

""Football is the only thing I am good at. Without it I'd be dead,"" he added.

""I thought my career would be over if I came out and started talking about my issues with drugs.

""Then I said to myself 'how about being honest for once in your life and admit your problems'.

""If my story helps one person, I'm happy to tell it. I'm happier, healthier and way more positive than I was.""

Belfast court: Woman jailed for drink driving crash,"A woman who caused a head-on collision whilst drunk driving was on her way to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, Belfast Crown Court has heard.",,None,"Image caption Laganside Court was told that O'Hara caused the crash whilst on her way to an AA meeting

A woman who caused a head-on collision whilst drunk driving was on her way to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, Belfast Crown Court has heard.

Briege O'Hara, 61, from Antrim Road, Belfast, was jailed for nine months on Monday.

She was driving on the wrong side of the road on 27 August 2013, when she hit another motorist and injured him.

The court was told that she knew the man whom she injured and was ""entirely remorseful"".

A prosecuting lawyer said the crash happened at 11:30 BST on the Antrim Road.

O'Hara had driven around a bend on the wrong side of the road and the van ""didn't have a chance"" to move out of her way.

She was arrested and tests showed she had been driving whilst over the limit.

O'Hara said she could not remember the crash. She said she had taken a glass of wine and 5mgs of Diazepam before leaving the house.

She pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily injury by dangerous driving and also driving with excess alcohol.

The van driver, a man in his mid 60s, broke his sternum and left hand in the collision and lost his job as a delivery driver as a result. He was treated in hospital for his injuries.

A defence lawyer said that while the incident was ""utterly disgraceful"", his client was ""entirely remorseful"".

He said that she had spent 12 weeks in residential care for alcohol addiction problems almost immediately after causing the crash and had not taken alcohol since then.

Her lawyer said she had had a very difficult life and was emotionally fragile.

O'Hara was sentenced to 18 months. She will spend half of this time in prison, with the remaining nine months spent on supervised licence. She was also banned from driving for three years.","['jailed', 'drink', 'crash', 'months', 'woman', 'lawyer', 'wrong', 'way', 'whilst', 'belfast', 'driving', 'road', 'court', 'van']","Image caption Laganside Court was told that O'Hara caused the crash whilst on her way to an AA meetingA woman who caused a head-on collision whilst drunk driving was on her way to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, Belfast Crown Court has heard.

How jeans giant Levi Strauss got its mojo back,The US clothing firm is now enjoying five years of profit growth as it recovers from past woes.,,None,"Image copyright Levi Strauss

Chip Bergh has the air of man at ease with the world. But things could have turned out very different, given what he calls his ""dysfunctional"" childhood.

The 60-year-old chief executive of Levi Strauss, dressed in regulation blue jeans and denim shirt, readily admits to be being ""blessed and lucky"".

Six years into his successful turnaround of the once struggling US clothing firm, he says the job still gives him a ""wow"" feeling.

Mr Bergh and his family also love their San Francisco lifestyle, where the vegan boss pursues a passion for marathons and triathlons.

So, professionally and personally, things are going well for the former Procter & Gamble (P&G) executive.

But growing up in the suburbs of New York City there were times when he felt neither blessed nor lucky.

Mr Bergh's father was an advertising salesman working 14-hour days. He was also an alcoholic.

Image copyright Devaki Knowles

There could be ""lots of screaming and yelling"" at home, Mr Bergh recalls. ""Mum and dad were always getting in fights.""

One day his mother threatened to throw out his dad. ""That was a wake up call,"" says Mr Bergh.

His father then finally went to Alcoholics Anonymous, cleaned himself up and never touched another drop.

""I'm proud that my dad recovered,"" says Mr Bergh. ""He rebuilt his life.""

Mr Bergh's childhood wasn't unhappy. ""I had a lot of friends, played a lot of sport, and went to a great school,"" he says. But as the eldest of three children he says he shouldered much of the domestic discord, and grew up fast.

It left its mark and is in part behind his drive to succeed, he thinks. It also left a determination not to repeat some of his father's mistakes.

""I'm pretty level-headed,"" says Mr Bergh. ""There's not a lot that really upsets me. I'm not a yeller and screamer, at home or work. I'm pretty relaxed."" And he doesn't drink.

Image copyright Levi Strauss Image caption Levi Strauss emigrated to the US from Germany in 1853 when he was 18

So, how does Mr Bergh sum up his management style? ""Very open, honest, transparent. What you see is what you get.""

He insists he's ""really down to earth"", adding: ""I put my pants on the same way everybody else does - one leg at a time.""

Just don't confuse this regular-guy image with a lack of steel, as Mr Bergh's overhaul of Levi's has been radical, some might say brutal.

The company was created in 1873 when San Francisco-based wholesale merchant Levi Strauss and a business partner patented a way to strengthen denim trousers using copper rivets. The rest as they say is history.

Through slick advertising and campaigning on social and political issues (such as donating millions to HIV/Aids charities), Levi's punched above its weight for decades.

Stories were common in the 1960s and 1970s of young Westerners packing Levi's jeans in their luggage to help barter their way through holidays behind the Iron Curtain.

If ever a brand deserved the label ""iconic"", Levi's was it.

Image copyright Levi Strauss Image caption The Levi 501 jeans are arguably the company's single most important product

But by the time Mr Bergh took over in 2011, the company he calls the original Silicon Valley start-up ""had lost its way"".

Annual sales peaked in 1997 at $7.1bn (£5.3bn). ""We were bigger than Nike then,"" says Mr Bergh. ""Nike aspired to be like Levi's.""

But Levi's lost its knack of combining heritage with changing trends, and by the early 2000s sales had fallen to $4bn.

Competition from the likes of Walmart and Gap had increased rapidly. Levi had also borrowed heavily, chiefly to buy out scores of Strauss family descendants, and consolidate ownership.

The result, says Mr Bergh, was that the firm found it had to ""cut costs, cut marketing, to save cash"".

Levi's board ultimately decided it needed a fresh pair of hands, and so turned to Mr Bergh, who had the brand expertise and international experience it wanted.

After 28 years at P&G, most latterly working on the Old Spice deodorant and razors accounts, Mr Bergh saw a chance to fulfil an ambition to become a chief executive.

""It was too good an opportunity to pass,"" he says. ""It was an opportunity to make a difference, and leave a legacy.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chip Bergh is not afraid to ""double denim""

All too aware that Levi's was struggling, Mr Bergh sent the firm's then top 60 managers six questions about the pros and cons of the business - and started interviewing each of them.

""But by about the 15th interview it was pretty clear what needed to be done,"" he says. ""There was no strategy, there was no alignment across the organisation... People were frustrated.""

More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world:

Mr Bergh invested in facilities, broadened the clothing range (especially womenswear), and expanded in relatively untapped markets such as Russia, China and India.

The ecommerce operation, previously outsourced and treated almost as an after-thought, was brought in-house, modernised and expanded.

Mr Bergh also changed the top team at the business. Within 18 months of his appointment, nine of the 11-member executive team had left. Of the current 150 senior managers, two-thirds have been with the company for three years or less.

He says: ""We needed to change not just the business but the culture, and the best way to change the culture is to change the leadership.""

Image copyright Levi Strauss Image caption The original US patent for riveted jeans, from 1873

Mr Bergh admits the clear out was dramatic, sometimes traumatic, but says: ""You always have to do the harder right than the easier wrong.""

Did he learn such decisiveness in the army, which he joined for two years after school? Making quick decisions was certainly part of the skill-set, he says. But the army also taught him about leadership.

""It's wrong that the army is all about deference and saluting seniors,"" he says. ""You have to earn respect, build trust, be willing to make decisions, coach people and train people - all those skills are transferable to the corporate world.""

The army's downside was that promotion moved slowly, and Mr Bergh wanted to ""move ahead quickly"". A recruitment firm found him a job at P&G.

Levi's turnaround seems to be succeeding, with 2017 expected to see the fifth consecutive year of profits growth.

Retail analyst Marshal Cohen, of market research group NPD, says that yet again Levi's has been able to ""reinvent"" itself to a new generation.

However, Mr Bergh says the job is far from finished. ""We have made really good progress. It's been harder and taken longer than I expected.

""I'm not satisfied with where we are. We still have a lot more work to do.""","['image', 'levi', 'levis', 'strauss', 'giant', 'way', 'business', 'caption', 'copyright', 'bergh', 'mr', 'mojo', 'jeans']","Image copyright Levi StraussChip Bergh has the air of man at ease with the world.

LYDIA

I THINK THAT YOU ARE VERY STRONG. Rod

Control is the most important thing! With me, I try to place my limits...I know what not to drink...I stick to beer which is not as damaging as the rest....cheers Kevin

Well done Lani for showing how damaging drink can be. A good insight into the drink cycle. You can be treated at some very good clinics free to all,if you feel your drinking is out of control. Ian

This makes me think twice about some of my friends I see out every weekend. I don't think we really understand how serious being drunk every weekend can be. Andy

I can relate to what you are saying 100%....I recently almost dropped out of college due to drink. I stop for a while then go back to it. I wish you all the best for the future. Kate Bartholomew

Lani chooses to share with us a subject that many would feel ashamed to put into the public arena. Alcoholism is too often associated with older people, and we forget that people of Lani's age suffer from it too. She shows a lot of emotion, particularly when talking about her parents, who appear to be a huge concern for her. Along with a goal of returning to university, her parents may be her aid in battling this illness. Jessica

Thank u for the warnings. I hope things work out for u. Don't give up hope. Graeme

How brave are you ? Well done and please know you inspire me. I know of my problems and I know I can't deal with them yet, allthough I know I must! It has been at least a 14 year battle, since I was married anyway and I have drank since 16 yrs old! My marriage has broken and I have 2 children as well, it is the worst Christmas and general time ever! David Mahon

I hope your doing well, a really truthful and thoughtful video. Karrie - San Jose California.

Lani, You are far more wonderful than even you know. I know when you did this video how hard that was for you to do. I understand that you're motive was to help other people. I wanted you to know that the things you lost (college/University) are still there. I can promise you, as a Mom myself, that you will never lose your Mom and Dad. I just have so much respect for you. Angela

Thanks. How brave you are. In the future society will be condemned for its lack of understanding of the medical condition. Until we all understand that Alcoholism is a desease we cannot improve matters Chan Yew Gin

My friend was an alcoholic. He had many friends with him when he was drinking cause he pays for the drinks most of the time. He will drink until late into the night. During this time he forgets his wife, children and home. He owns a Mercedes but he need not have to drive his car. His friends will come and pick him up. Just last year his health deteriorated. He was warned by the doctor to stop drinking immediately. What happened? All his friends deserted him. Most of them did not even visit him when he was warded in hospital for about a month. I call all of them 'FAIR WEATHER FRIENDS' So please beware of such kind of friends. They know you only during drinking session. Get rid of alcohol and you will automatically get rid of these kind of friends. Jade Shaw

Hi, I have had that experience myself. It doesn't do any good and doesn't help at all but at the end I got through it with lots of help from close family & friends. I hope everything goes alright for you and you get through. Good Luck. x David

I am so pleased to see the links to Alcoholics Anonymous. As a health professional, as well as a recovering alcoholic, I am well aware that most health workers involved with Alcoholics ignore AA despite the fact that it seems to be more effective at helping people recover than anything else. Alcohol misuse is an enormous problem which needs to be addressed more sincerely by the government - thank you for highlighting it Mick Knight

Thanks to Lani for this first-hand view of alcohol and alcoholism. I recently attended a seminar in which the speaker, a person experienced in the field of drug and alcohol abuse, said that of all addictions she feared alcohol the most. The majority of drug abusers will eventually kick their habit, but this is not so with alcoholics. Perhaps that's because there isn't the stigma attached to alcohol and it is a legal stimulant? Julia

Thanks for talking about the dangers of alcohol. It is a drug which causes many problems. I hope things work out for you. Renata Macfarlane

Alot of young people don't realise that alcohol is a deadly addictive drug and it's so easy to get it. When you start feeling depressed and you're longing for a drink in order to improve your mood, that is the sign that u r addicted. Watch out! The only way is down from now on. Thanks for this video. People shoud be warned of the danger of alcohol everyday if possible.","['hope', 'drink', 'alcohol', 'health', 'good', 'brownett', 'know', 'lani', 'video', 'drinking', 'alcoholism', 'friends', 'drug']","WATCH THIS VIDEOTo view the video you will need REALPLAYERALCOHOLISMBy Lani BrownettLani originally wanted to talk about cooking but has more serious issues on her mind.

Answers It's Kennedy, who was friends with Williams. Mancini wrote the music to The Pink Panther, in which Lom starred, and composed Moon River, which Williams sang. Sellers acted alongside Lom in The Pink Panther and alongside Williams' ex-wife, Claudine Longet. It's whisky. In what is claimed to be a world first, a deal has been signed to turn by-products from a Scottish distillery into fuel for cars. It's yoga classes. ""Yoga is a Hindu spiritual exercise. Being a Catholic church we have to promote the Gospel, and that's what we use our premises for,"" Father John Chandler from Southampton was quoted as saying. It's the clause about weights and measures remaining uniform throughout the realm. According to the British Library, only three clauses remain valid, the final one defending the freedom and rights of the English Church. It's Australia.

He said it turned out he could still keep his American citizenship. It's the inland taipan - known as the ""fierce snake"" because of the strength of its venom.

Classical music is quite irksome, it emanates a sort of pomposity, but it's one of the best things I have ever done, I'm loving it.

""You don't need to have been to a conservatoire to write pop songs, and it's more expensive to train conductors than it is to train astronauts or fighter pilots, but there's something about classical music. Yes, the classical-music fraternity are worse than Christians or Alcoholics Anonymous for wanting you to join, there's a kind of desperation about it sometimes, but when you're ready for it, it blows your mind.

""There's a misconception that classical music is for old people, so it does need rebranding. I would definitely recommend that kids listen to Rossini. You know, rock'n'roll is 50 years old now, and I wonder if it hasn't said everything it has got to say. Classical music really makes you appreciate what you're doing when you're playing a big, loud, out-of-tune, distorted bass.""

Brad: ""Conducting is not about pomp or mastery. It's about communication and creating an atmosphere in which everyone feels they're pointing in the same direction, and working towards a similar goal.

""There have been times when Alex has found it hard - starting something completely new, and having to stand up in front of a group of people and feel like a prat - but we're very patient with each other. We're mates.

""I've listened to some Blur since I started working with Alex, and we have a lot of fun together. Both being musicians helps - there's a lot of common ground and our sensibilities are similar.

""Alex knows there's a lot about conducting that is nothing to do with music, but the musical side is obviously a lot easier because he can read music, while other competitors on Maestro can only do so in a very limited way. It's a great advantage, with so much musical material to master, that he can learn scores a lot quicker. He's doing a great job, I have a lot of faith in him.""","['brad', 'bbc', 'maestro', 'alex', 'youre', 'music', 'working', 'train', 'lot', 'old', 'classical', 'stand', 'thoughts', 'theres']","Recent NewsThe Thoughts of Alex and BradStudent Alex James and his mentor Brad Cohen talked to John Elmes of The Independent.

Chris Bevan: Andy Morrison's biggest battle,"I am halfway through my interview with Andy Morrison when I notice the mass of scars on his knuckles for the first time, testimony to the scrapes he was involved...",,None,"I am halfway through my interview with Andy Morrison when I notice the mass of scars on his knuckles for the first time, testimony to the scrapes he was involved in during his colourful career.

""I had too many fights to put into my book,"" the former Manchester City, Huddersfield, Blackpool and Plymouth centre-back tells me of some of the brutal off-pitch tales which litter his new autobiography. ""So I just mentioned the ones which helped shape my career for better or worse.""

An unashamed bruiser he may be, but Morrison does not glorify his violent past. In any case, his biggest battles have been psychological, not physical.

In a week during which footballers' mental health has been in the spotlight following Gary Speed's death, Morrison's story, which was published last month, makes poignant reading.

Andy Morrison battled demons during and after his playing career. Photo: Getty Images

As a player, he battled alcoholism and, at his lowest ebb in 1999, which actually coincided with some of his best times on the field with City, he considered taking his own life before vowing instead to ditch the drink.

Morrison was the inspiration behind City's promotion that year from what is now League One - a time when this week's Champions League tie with Bayern Munich would have been unthinkable for his old club and one that seems light years away from their current status as mega-rich Premier League leaders. He has been on quite a journey himself.

""It's said that when you reach the pits of despair you turn within and ask for help,"" Morrison reflects. ""I was on my hands and knees when I looked at the sky and said 'please can you help me, I cannot take any more of this pain'. Thankfully I got the support I needed from Alcoholics Anonymous and for almost 13 years I have not touched a drop.""

But that was not the end of his problems. After injury curtailed his career in 2002 at the age of 32, Morrison faced financial ruin, while the chronic depression he has battled since hanging up his boots came because he missed the buzz of matchdays that had been part of his life since he was a young teenager.

""When you retire, there is a part of you where you keep a stiff upper lip,"" Morrison, now assistant manager at Evo-Stik League Premier Division side Northwich Victoria, explained over coffee in a leafy Cheshire village near his home.

""I was saying 'this is the next stage of my life, I'm going to be positive. I'm going to move on and get my coaching badges' and all that sort of stuff.

""But I wasn't prepared in any way to deal with that huge void in my life. I'd been a footballer from the age of 15 and I couldn't have been more institutionalised if I had been in the army. I loved competing.

""When I finished I went through a period of desolation. I had a desperate period of absolute uselessness for anything. Your confidence is affected and it is a downward spiral from there. I had absolutely nothing to look forward to.

""It's hard for footballers because, in so many aspects of your life, you are so much better off than other people but it is where you are in your head at that time that matters. I remember Stan Collymore being ridiculed for suffering from depression. John Gregory, his manager at Aston Villa, said how could someone earning £20,000 a week have it?

""But when you are suffering from chronic depression you don't go to a hole in the wall, stick your card in, look at your balance and see you have £200,000 in the bank and go 'that's it, I feel brilliant'. It's much deeper than that.

""I think people are coming round to understanding it a bit more and hopefully there is no shame attached to it anymore.

""Thankfully for me, I dealt with my drinking problem and my addictive alcoholism before I retired. God only help me if I hadn't, because I only know for sure that I wouldn't be sat here with you talking because it would have just got darker and worse.""

The good news for Morrison, and for those with similar problems, is that there was help out there then, and there still is now.

We do not know the reasons for Speed's death but the debate over mental health in football has been ongoing since Germany goalkeeper Robert Enke took his own life in 2009 and Rushden & Diamonds goalkeeper Dale Roberts killed himself a year later.

And despite the claims of Susannah Strong - author of a booklet on handling depression which the Professional Footballers' Association sent out to ex-players in the wake of Speed's death - that ""there is no attention paid whatsoever to the mental health of footballers"", the reality is that there has been a support system in place for some time.

Morrison, who was a warrior of a player known for inspiring team-mates and fans alike, feels Strong was right when she spoke of his condition being a taboo subject in football but says he was not left high and dry when he did reveal it and hopes others have the strength to do the same.

""There is a lot of support out there for footballers if they want to ask for it but when you are in such a desperate place it is hard to say 'I'm really struggling with life' and lower all your barriers and let your ego go,"" he added. ""I was the captain of every club I played for and I felt it was out of character to say I was struggling.

""When I did, I spoke to counsellors from Sporting Chance Clinic. They offered great help. I was given anti-depression tablets but there is no quick cure. For me, and I can only speak for me, there were no innate words of wisdom which were going to help me through it. It's a process and you have to be strong. You need all the help you can get.

""Anyone who suffers from it has to be brave enough to first recognise it - because that is the hardest thing - and then be willing to ask for help.""

Morrison is in a better place now. Professionally, he is enjoying his job with Northwich and dreaming of coaching in the Premier League. Personally, he savours life with wife Paula and their three children.

He has still not conquered all his demons, however. ""There are days when the black dog is at the bottom of the bed when I wake up,"" Morrison adds. ""He says 'good morning, I've been waiting for you'. There is nothing I can do to stop it happening, but now I know what to do when it does.""

Boy George named patron of Focus 12,,,2011-08-10 10:18:02,"Boy George has become a patron of Focus 12, the drug and alcohol rehabilitation charity based in Suffolk.

The singer and DJ said he wanted to spread the word that help is available for people who are struggling with addiction, and to their families.

Russell Brand and Davina McCall are also patrons of Focus 12.

He said the support and publicity provided by the patrons had kept Focus 12 running.

Boy George, whose real name is George O'Dowd, made his name with Culture Club and has himself battled with drug addiction.

""It did used to be something that was associated with music and celebrities, but nowadays it's so widespread,"" he said.

"Soul Music, Series 16, Make Me a Channel of Your Peace","Exploring the hymn that inspires campaigners, charity workers and reformed alcoholics.",,None,"An exploration of the global impact of the 1960s hymn 'Make Me a Channel of Your Peace'. Just what inspired it? From July 2013. Episode 3 of 5.

The hymn 'Make Me a Channel of Your Peace' found its way into weddings, funerals and school assemblies and in this week's 'Soul Music' we hear how it has also embedded itself into the hearts of peace campaigners, charity workers and reformed alcoholics.

The simplicity of this hymn often belies the challenges at its heart. Its lyrics call for unconditional love and forgiveness in the toughest situations. The words are based on a poem which has often been attributed to St Francis of Assisi. However, Franciscan Historian, Dr Christian Renoux, suggests it was most likely to have been written by an anonymous French noble women.

The poem travelled across the globe with translations published during the first and second world wars, subsequently bringing inspiration to public figures ranging from Mother Theresa to President Roosevelt.

In 1967 it caught the eye of South African born musician and 'yogi' Sebastian Temple who put these words to its most famous musical arrangement. It's Sebastian's version that was played at Princess Diana's funeral and that has also touched the hearts of millions worldwide.

Mathew Neville of children's charity 'World Vision' recalls his encounter with this hymn in the Democratic Republic of Congo, whilst closer to home Wendy and Colin Parry share their memories of this music and the role it played in remembering their son Tim, who was killed in the 1993 Warrington Bombings.

In Minnesota former lawyer Mike Donohue reflects on how this hymn has guided him on a journey through alcohol abuse and dementia and Sarah Hershberg remembers her good friend Sebastian Temple, who first played this simple hymn in her front room before it went on to travel the world.","['soul', 'sebastian', 'hearts', 'words', 'music', 'hymn', 'temple', 'poem', 'channel', '16', 'world', 'peace', 'series', 'played']","An exploration of the global impact of the 1960s hymn 'Make Me a Channel of Your Peace'.

"Thought for the Day, Thought for the Day",Rev Dr Giles Fraser,,None,"“Christian morality is a thing so strange that it must be declared immoral according to all other codes of morality”: so writes the distinguished theologian John Milbank. And few plays demonstrate this unsettling perspective more directly than the Tirso De Molina’s remarkable 17th century drama, Damned by Despair, which began its run of previews at the National Theatre last night. It’s a play that’s bound to confuse those who think of Christianity as fundamentally a system of ethics because it tells of a pious morally upright hermit who goes to hell and a murderous gangster who goes to heaven.

In moral terms, this simply doesn’t figure. But for traditional catholic Christianity, morality is something of a side issue. The central concern of Christianity is with salvation not morality. Damned by Despair sets these two perspectives against each other.

The earliest battle between these different understandings was set up between Pelagius and Augustine. Pelagius argued that Christianity was fundamentally about being good, a question of keeping all the rules. And those who keep the rules go to heaven, those who don’t go to hell. It’s that simple. So why was Pelagius’ teaching rejected by the

church? Because, argued Augustine, ‘being good’ is never that simple. Anticipating Freud, Augustine insisted that human beings are more complicated, more driven by mixed and unacknowledged motives, more compromised by our nature. Whereas Pelagius’ sunny view of the human condition makes virtue seem entirely straightforward, Augustine argued

we are not programmed for easy virtue. His called it “original sin” – which is more an existential than a moral category, not so much about individual misdeeds than about human beings being fundamentally broken.

For Augustine, then, human beings need to be fixed. And this fixing is so profound that only God is capable of doing it. As with Alcoholics Anonymous, the first thing is to admit that you have a problem and that you cannot sort it out yourself. Then you need to ask for help. That is the difference between the two main characters of the play: one knows he is flawed, the other does not. One asks for

help, the other thinks he can do it alone.

Unlike De Molina, I don’t believe in hell in any literal sense. But his point still stands. Christianity is not a self-help programme for being good with eternal rewards attached. Quite the reverse: it’s an admission of incapacity. More a cry for help than an assertion of our

intrinsic virtue. It’s easy to caricature this as self-flagellation, but I see it as an honest assertion of the human condition. The message of Damned by Despair is as disturbing today as it was in the seventeenth century: those who trust in their own virtue are often the most lost of all.","['despair', 'day', 'good', 'christianity', 'hell', 'human', 'morality', 'virtue', 'fundamentally', 'augustine', 'thought', 'pelagius']","But for traditional catholic Christianity, morality is something of a side issue.

Bosence Farm drug unit fears funding future,The head of a drug and alcohol rehabilitation unit in Cornwall fears changes in government funding could threaten its future.,,None,"Image caption Bosence Farm has been helping people with drug and alcohol dependence for 16 years

The head of a Cornish drug and alcohol rehabilitation unit says he fears changes in government funding could threaten its future.

Bosence Farm near Hayle, treats patients on programmes lasting from nine to 12 months.

Derek Mace says he fears these may now be cut back because of the uncertain economic climate.

The Department of Health says a final decision will not be made until later this year.

Bosence Farm has been providing residential help for people with drug and alcohol dependence since 1995.

Mr Mace said: ""Those people who stay around for nine or 10 months are the ones who are best equipped to engage properly with the wider society and stay off drink and drugs on a permanent basis.""

The addiction recovery programme includes psychotherapy, yoga, meditation and relaxation.

Staff use a 12-step programme recommended by Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous.

'Amazing benefits'

Jack, who has been a patient at the farm for nine months, said: ""I came to save my life really. I would be dead otherwise, I took heroin, alcohol, pills, anything really.

""This is the first 12-step programme I have ever tried. The benefits I am getting from it now are amazing. If I left after six months it would have been a complete waste of time. You're going straight back into the lion's den.""

Bob Crossland, of the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Drug and Alcohol Action Team said, he was more optimistic about funding.

""Payment by results is a worry for a lot of people for lots of reasons, but it's also a potential opportunity to get more money in the future.""

A spokesman for the Department of Health said a number of pilots would be run throughout 2011.","['alcohol', 'mace', 'health', 'dependence', 'fears', 'funding', 'farm', 'bosence', 'programme', 'drug', 'months', 'future', 'unit', 'stay']","Image caption Bosence Farm has been helping people with drug and alcohol dependence for 16 yearsThe head of a Cornish drug and alcohol rehabilitation unit says he fears changes in government funding could threaten its future.

Sex addiction: 'Five times a day wasn't enough',Two sex addicts speak about the impact it has had on their lives.,,None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Rebecca Barker said sex addiction took over her life and ruined her relationship

Sex addiction divides expert opinion, but for some people it is a very real condition that can be shameful and even ""life-destroying"". As relationship charity Relate calls for help to be made available on the NHS, two sufferers speak about the impact it has had on their lives.

""At its worst, even having sex five times a day wasn't enough.""

Mother-of-three Rebecca Barker said the compulsion took over her life in 2014 and ruined her relationship.

Her addiction meant she was constantly asking her partner for sex.

""It was literally the first thing I thought about when I woke up, I just couldn't get it off my mind,"" said the 37-year-old, originally from Tadcaster in North Yorkshire.

""I felt like everything reminded me of it. I think it was linked to my depression and the lack of serotonin. I felt like my whole body was craving it.

""It was giving me the instant hit and five minutes later I wanted it again.

""I became a hermit, I stayed at home because I felt ashamed that it was all I could think about. Even though no-one could read my mind, it still felt very uncomfortable for me to be around other people.""

Image copyright Rebecca Barker Image caption Ms Barker split with her partner and made lifestyle changes in a bid to control her addiction

Ms Barker's addiction caused serious problems in her relationship. Though her partner enjoyed the attention at first, it became insurmountable for the couple.

""At first he was fine with it but towards the end he couldn't understand it at all. After a few months he started to raise questions about why and where it was coming from.

""He accused me of having an affair - he thought I must have been feeling guilty about it and that's why I wanted sex with him.""

In November 2014, Ms Barker ""needed a break"" from the relationship and went to stay with her mother.

""When I left, I told my partner I needed to get better. He let me go, then the relationship broke down very quickly after that.

""I was under the care of a psychiatrist at the time - she kept saying she would alter my medication but she never said there were any support groups or anything.""

Ms Barker was diagnosed with depression in 2012 after the birth of her third child. She said after it intensified in 2014 she changed jobs, split up with her partner and moved to France.

""I made many lifestyle changes in order to get over the depression and the addiction and for me that has worked,"" she said.

What is sex addiction?

Relate defines sexual addiction as any sexual activity that feels ""out of control"".

The Association for the Treatment of Sex Addiction and Compulsivity says its number of sex therapists has doubled in the past five years to 170

A questionnaire completed by 21,058 people since 2013 on the Sex Addiction Help website revealed 91% of those seeking help for sex addiction were male

The largest age group of 31% was aged 26-35, 1% were under 16 and 8% over 55

The World Health Organization is expected to approve the inclusion of ""compulsive sexual behaviour disorder"" in its International Classification of Diseases (ICD) list in May 2019

The NHS says experts disagree about whether it is possible to become addicted to sex and points to Relate for further help

Graham, whose name has been changed to protect his identity, said his compulsion led him to cheat on his wife with ""hundreds"" of sex workers, leaving him with ""rip-roaring guilt"".

""When you are in full-blown addiction you are obsessed with thinking about it - from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep.

""It was a horrible, gross experience - there is nothing sexy about it. When you wake up in the morning with a dose of chlamydia, it is not sexy.

""It is damaging and life-destroying.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Graham said when his wife found out he was relieved

Graham, who is in his 60s, estimates he paid hundreds of pounds a month for sex over several years, even building relationships with some of the sex workers he saw.

""What started with one affair at work led to another - but unlike most office affairs which may stem from one partner being unhappily married, mine was an addiction which I had to feed each day.

""You have one affair and then you want another and another one.

""I soon realised that the quickest and most convenient way for me to feed my addiction was to pay for it. I would be seeing escorts, sex workers, three or four times per week.

""It is just like being an alcoholic, it's a cycle that builds up in your mind - you feel a high from thinking about how it might happen and then you act it out in the way you planned.

""Then when it's over you feel remorseful, you say you're never going to do it again.""

Graham stopped leading his ""horrendous double life"" when his wife found an email and confronted him.

He sought help from Sex Addicts Anonymous (SAA), which has 78 self-help groups around the UK, and said he has abstained from extra-marital sex for several years.

""When I was found out, I remember feeling 'thank God - something might change'.

""I went to SAA which is an abstinence-based treatment. I call it going from shame to grace.

""It is such a relief to go to the meetings and find out there are other people who are just as miserable and sordid as you are.

""For people who are in this situation, I just want them to know that there is a way out and you can break the cycle.""

Peter Saddington, from Relate, said there is some therapy and group work available for sex addicts, but most of it is private.

""[Addicts] realise it is causing harm, but they can't stop and they recognise they need help in changing it.

""For alcoholics, there is Alcoholics Anonymous, but they can also go to the NHS [which] provides support for people who have alcohol or drug problems.

""It would be appropriate that [sex addicts] can go to their GP and get support because it has a crippling effect both on them, on relationships, on their families, their financial situation and their mental health.""

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""People who think they may have a sex addiction can seek advice and help via NHS Choices, which includes contacts at Relate, Sexaholics Anonymous, SAA and ATSAC.""

Lou Vincent: The most brutal form of apology,Cricketer Lou Vincent this week admitted he was a cheat. His apology came in stark style.,,None,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lou Vincent

The cricketer Lou Vincent has admitted attempting to fix matches. His apology came in stark style.

He exhales loudly. Then he begins his statement: ""My name is Lou Vincent and I am a cheat.""

The former New Zealand cricketer, in 10 words, admits what he has done, how he has contravened and undermined his own sport by accepting money for match-fixing. Viewers are left in no doubt.

Vincent, at the age of 35, has been banned for life from playing, coaching or participating in any other way in organised cricket after breaching 18 anti-corruption rules in matches played in 2008 and 2011.

Even so, the nature of the opening of his video confession - in which he goes on to say he has ""shamed"" his sport, country and family - seems unusually stark.

The formula of the opening words is the same as that used by some members of Alcoholics Anonymous. Those attending at meetings are not compelled to say: ""My name is XXXX and I am an alcoholic."" But many choose to do so, citing its cathartic effect and the creation of a sense of community.

Vincent, who has suffered from depression, is unlikely to feel the same immediate mutual support from his fellow cricketers. But might he eventually gain respect for his statement, in which he also says he wants to face up to what he has done ""like a man and accept the consequences""?

""It's very healthy,"" says Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at Lancaster University. ""You don't get enough of people admitting when they've done something wrong, particularly in the workplace.""

Image copyright Reuters

Uruguayan footballer Luis Suarez has faced criticism over his initial refusal to apologise for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini in a World Cup match. He has since given a qualified apology - one that expressed sympathy for his victim but did not fully address Suarez's culpability and ongoing problem.

""What the cricketer has done is completely unlike the Suarez situation,"" says Cooper. ""If Suarez had come out straight away and said he'd done wrong under the stress of the situation he would have received much more sympathy. What's happened here in cricket will raise Vincent in people's estimation. The timing is absolutely key.""

Vincent recorded his statement after admitting to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) that he had committed match-fixing offences in Twenty20 games when he played for Lancashire and Sussex. It pre-empted the ECB's own announcement.

Sussex County Cricket Club has welcomed the punishment of Vincent, who has played in 23 Tests and 102 one-day internationals. ""The episode has been a very difficult time for our players, staff and indeed all supporters of Sussex Cricket,"" says chief executive Zac Toumazi. ""We are determined to do all we can to drive this issue away from our game and remain vigilant and committed in doing so.""

Cricket is keen to clean up its image after revelations going back more than a decade, when it was revealed the South African captain Hansie Cronje had fixed matches.

In his confession in 2000, Cronje opened by saying he had been a Christian all his life and had tried to ""walk the way the Lord wanted me to walk"".

Hansie Cronje

Banned from cricket for life in June 2000

Died in plane crash in South Africa's Western Cape in 2002

The golfer Tiger Woods, in his scripted 2010 apology in front of the world's media for his marital infidelities, also adopted a more gradual introduction to the description of his wrongdoings than Vincent.

""Good morning. And thank you for joining me,"" he said. ""Many of you in the room are my friends. Many of you in this room know me. Many of you have cheered for me, or worked with me, or supported me, and now, every one of you has good reason to be critical of me.

""I want to say to each of you, simply, and directly, I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish behaviour I engaged in.""

Could Vincent's more direct statement lead to some form of public redemption, even if it does not, and cannot, involve any future involvement with cricket?

""What he has done is probably the best way,"" says speechwriter and presentation coach Max Atkinson. ""It reminds me of (Liberal Democrat leader) Paddy Ashdown in 1992 admitting he had had an affair. That worked. He came across as honest. It's best just to come out and say it.""

The difference is that Ashdown could argue his personal life did not interfere with his professional one. Like Cronje, Vincent cannot.

But Peter Davies, a consultant at Manchester PR firm RMS, thinks there is a chance of a return to some standing. ""Lou Vincent's statement comes across like it's personal,"" he says. ""That's good. Although he must have had advice, probably including from his lawyers, it doesn't sound like that. It's not over-scripted and he does it in his own voice.

""But Vincent has lots of work to do if he wants to change his image. He'll have to do something to show he's trying to make a difference and he's truly changed his ways.""

Recovering Durham alcoholic starts blog to help others,A recovering alcoholic from Durham is sharing his experiences in beating his addiction in an online blog designed to help others.,,None,"Image caption Martin Prest drank 83 units in two days

A recovering alcoholic from Durham is sharing his thoughts and experiences in an online blog to help others beat the addiction.

Martin Prest has been sober for 18 months following his daily battle with drink for the past eight years.

He regularly used to drink about 18 pints a day.

He has now set up the informative blog, Open Alcoholic, to catalogue his experience battling alcohol addiction.

""I thought that alcoholism is so difficult sometimes to understand from the outside if you haven't lived it, and after speaking to people over my 18 months sobriety... family members or people who care about them, they can't necessarily understand,"" Mr Prest said.

""They've asked me what it's like and to try an explain this process, this mindset, that they've watched destroy someone and I really wanted to use the website to try and explain it better.""

My entire body was falling apart, I had nothing left in life but the drinking Martin Prest

The 26-year-old uses his blog to explain how he came to terms with his addiction and overcame it, but how it still troubles him.

Mr Prest unknowingly had his first taste of alcohol when he was just seven-years-old.

""It was funny because I didn't know it was alcoholic and I knew I wasn't allowed to drink it,"" he said.

""I started stealing sips of it in the morning when I was seven, it was on a top shelf on a cupboard and I could nip up and get it and have a sip, just because I liked the taste of it, I didn't know what it was or anything.""

Following this early taste his drinking habits became out of control from the age of 18 and he went from being a social drinker to drinking alone and getting drunk.

""I drank until I was drunk and could finally fall asleep, everyday for years. The only time I actually noted down how much I drank was my last weekend drinking,"" he said.

""I knew I was going to stop drinking, I was sort of saying farewell to it and I drank through 83 units in two days, I was drinking mostly bitters and real ale and that's 18 pints and I wasn't drunk - I could still walk straight and I was still holding conversations and stuff, I mean how much I drank when I did get drunk I have no idea, more than that.""

'Spontaneously haemorrhaging'

After years of destroying his body through drink, his health problems became visible.

""My entire body was falling apart, I had nothing left in life but the drinking,"" he said.

""I was spontaneously haemorrhaging, I was bleeding out of my face from the damage that was being done, my head was just exploding in pain constantly my body was just wrecked. I knew I had to stop drinking.""

Mike Scott, a GP in Newcastle, said: ""Liver disease can lose the blood's ability to clot, so therefore you tend to bleed more easily.

""A cut or damage to the skin is arguably going to bleed more with an unhealthy liver.""

Mr Prest, added: ""It's such an insane process because you lose everything and it ruins your life essentially, I mean I've obviously picked back up again but you still want to drink you still want to get drunk, it never ever goes away, it's just engrained in your personality.""

Street Doctor in Chester,"Four GPs hit the streets of Chester for an open urban surgery an episode of BBC ONE's Street Doctor and advise patients about female hair loss, snoring, giving up smoking, and  skin cancer.",,None,"The Street Doctors visit the historic Roman city of Chester.

Chester is the county city of Cheshire. The area is known as a healthy place to live but with binge drinking higher than the England average and diabetes cases on the increase the Street Doctors still have their work cut out.

Dr Ayan starts his day down by the River Dee where he meets Rahima who is worried about female hair loss.

Dr Ayan's diagnosis of Rahima is that her hair loss is probably due to excessive dying of her hair in the past. However, female hair loss can be related to hormone levels, particularly sex hormones like oestrogen and progesterone and also the hormones produced by the thyroid gland.

If you're a woman who's concerned about hair loss Dr Ayan advises:

- Cut down on the number and frequency of hairstyling products you use on a regular basis.

- Look at your diet and lifestyle - poor nutrition can have a detrimental effect on hair.

- Look at the stress levels in your life and whether you can reduce them.

- If you need further help visit your GP.

Dr Barbara visits a sandwich factory where she meets Ali who has a problem with snoring and is a smoker. Ali's snoring is so bad that it often wakes his partner. Dr Barbara explains that generally snoring is caused because the soft palate at the back of the throat (where the dangly bit or uvula is) is weaker. Smoking effects your breathing and your nasal passages and is likely to make snoring worse.

Dr Barbara tests Ali's lung capacity with a spirometer and finds that Ali's peak flow is much lower than it should be and his lungs are 10 years older than his actual age. Giving up smoking would improve his health generally but should also make his snoring better. However, Dr Barbara advises that he could ask to be referred to an ear, nose and throat specialist to get further advice about his snoring problem.

If you'd like to give up smoking Dr Barbara says:

- It can take up to 8 attempts so commitment is vital if you are to succeed.

- Chose a nicotine replacement method which suits your circumstances such as gum, patches or an inhalator.

- If necessary, attend a support service at your local GP's clinic.

- Have a clear time scale in mind.

- If you're struggling see your GP for further help and support.

Dr Jonty goes to Cheshire Ice-Cream Farm where he bumps into a Malcolm who has a mole behind his ear that he is worried about. Malcolm explains that it appeared about 3 months ago, he cut it shaving and it hasn't healed since.

Dr Jonty inspects the mole and is concerned because the mole isn't healing and it has the appearance of a smooth edge with ulceration in the centre. This leads Dr Jonty to think it's possibly a basal cell carcinoma (BCC) which is a form of skin cancer.

This is different and not as dangerous as malignant melanoma, the more aggressive type of skin cancer, because it doesn't spread to other parts of the body. However, Dr Jonty tells Malcolm he must go to his GP and get the mole removed and sent for testing at a lab as soon as possible.

The sun is responsible for 90% of all skin cancers. If you want to reduce your risk Dr Jonty advises:

- Stay out of the sun during hottest times and make sure you don't get burnt.

- Cover up when outdoors in the middle of the day.

- Always wear at least factor 15 sunscreen.

- If you have any skin growth that won't heal or changes in size, colour or shape - see your GP.","['snoring', 'barbara', 'street', 'mole', 'loss', 'smoking', 'hair', 'jonty', 'malcolm', 'dr', 'doctor', 'skin', 'chester']","Dr Ayan's diagnosis of Rahima is that her hair loss is probably due to excessive dying of her hair in the past.

Overage Drinkers,"The growing problem of alcohol abuse among older people, told through personal stories.",,None,"Alcohol abuse by the over 60s is growing, as young people are drinking less. Leala Padmanabhan investigates, telling the story of her late father, who became alcoholic in his 70s.

Heavy drinking by older people is causing a major public health risk in the UK, yet the issue often falls below the radar.

While alcohol consumption among the young is falling, the over 60s are drinking more, and more harmfully, with one in three developing problems with alcohol for the first time in later life and alcohol-related hospital admissions among the old rising alarmingly.

BBC reporter Leala Padmanabhan investigates, starting with the story of her own father who developed alcoholism in his 70s while caring for her mother, who has alcoholism-related dementia. Despite his background as a doctor and his long experience of witnessing his wife's alcoholism, Leala's father was unable to rehabilitate himself, and his drink problem helped contribute to his death in 2010.

Leala's family is the starting point for a programme telling her own and similar stories.

A large number of people are developing problems in later life, partly because of social factors associated with their age, such as loneliness, bereavement, depression and boredom.

In addition to these late-onset drinkers there is a large number of ""baby boomers"" who are carrying heavy drinking patterns into old age.

And yet alcohol problems are less likely to be detected in older people, and where problems are detected, they are less likely to be referred to an alcohol service for treatment.

Leala talks to family members and friends about her own father's decline. She also interviews people grappling with a similar problem, campaigners working to raise awareness, people working in treatment services, and social and medical experts.","['problems', 'alcohol', 'working', 'starting', 'young', 'father', 'drinkers', 'social', 'drinking', 'similar', 'telling', 'overage']","Alcohol abuse by the over 60s is growing, as young people are drinking less.

The girl who's banned from buying booze,"She's been called everything from a menace to a hellraiser. She's been followed around by camera crews, the tabloid press and groups have been started about her on Facebook.",,None,"She's been called everything from a menace to a hellraiser. She's been followed around by camera crews, the tabloid press and groups have been started about her on Facebook.

Laura Hall from Bromsgrove in the Midlands is not the latest X Factor wannabe or a World Cup WAG.

The 20-year-old is famous for being the first person to be banned from buying alcohol anywhere in England and Wales.

""I am terrible when I've had a drink,"" she told Newsbeat.

""Alcohol is my best friend and my worst enemy.""

Laura had a lot going for her when she left school in 2006; a good group of friends, a supportive family and a batch of GCSEs.

Five years later she's had just one real job as a shop assistant.

It fell through and she's still living in her parents' large detached house outside Birmingham and claiming unemployment benefit.

""I would never dream of going out for the evening without a drink,"" she said.

""The first time I got arrested I was drinking down the park with my friends when a policeman came over and took the alcohol off us.

""We saw him later in the night and nicked his helmet from the police car.""

Since then she has been arrested dozens of times for alcohol-related offences and spent time in a young offenders centre in Bristol.

'Can't go on'

In April a judge, frustrated at Laura's 25th appearance in court, gave her the UK's first Drinking Banning Order.

""You are going to drink yourself to death before long,"" he said at the time. ""You can't go on behaving like this in public.""

I am getting help on probation and I really want to try Alcoholics Anonymous again. It makes me feel really guilty Laura Hall

Drinking Banning Orders, or Booze Asbos as they are nicknamed by the tabloid press, were brought in by the old Labour government last year.

If Laura buys alcohol from any bar, club or off licence in England and Wales, or carries open bottles around on the street she is now breaking the law.

Not that the ban has really curbed Laura's drinking. She spent last weekend in custody after knocking back vodka, lying in the middle of the road and abusing the police and ambulance staff who came to help her.

'Getting help'

""I think it has made me cut down a bit but it hasn't stopped me,"" she said.

""Something absolutely major would have to happen to make me give up.""

Laura now admits she needs help. There's talk of rehab paid for by a tabloid newspaper or by the camera crew which is now following her about for a television documentary.

""I am getting help on probation and I really want to try Alcoholics Anonymous again,"" she said.

""It makes me feel really guilty. I have put alcohol before everything and everybody in my life.""

But with Laura's 21st birthday just a few weeks away there is little of chance of her quitting just yet. She is already planning a trip away to Crete with her mates next month.

""I am going on holiday and, I'm not going to lie, it's not going to be an orange juice holiday,"" she said.

""But it's not going to be a massive bender, it's going to be one night out and the rest of it will be a quiet holiday.

""And after that I'm going to get serious.""","['lauras', 'alcohol', 'shes', 'banned', 'drink', 'whos', 'buying', 'really', 'going', 'booze', 'tabloid', 'drinking', 'help', 'try', 'girl']","She's been followed around by camera crews, the tabloid press and groups have been started about her on Facebook.

Manchester riots: Doughnut thief jailed for 16 months,A man who helped himself to doughnuts from a Krispy Kreme shop during riots in Manchester city centre is jailed for 16 months.,,None,"Image caption Thomas Downey had spent his only £4 on tobacco

A man who helped himself to doughnuts from a Krispy Kreme shop during riots in Manchester city centre has been jailed for 16 months.

Thomas Downey, 48, was released from HMP Manchester on 9 August shortly before getting caught up in the riots.

The serial offender went to a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous before downing a bottle of sherry and stumbling into Krispy Kreme in Piccadilly Gardens.

He was caught with a box of doughnuts when 20 riot officers arrived.

Downey admitted burglary and breach of an Asbo by entering part of the city centre from which he is prohibited.

Judge Robert Atherton, sentencing at Manchester Crown Court, told him: ""You drink too much, too regularly and when in drink become threatening and abusive.""

'Expressed remorse'

The total cost of damage to the shop - which was unsecured before Downey went in for the doughnuts - was about £17,000, prosecutors said.

The court heard he had more than 100 convictions for 233 offences and had been released from prison at 19:30 BST that day.

Zoe Nield, for Downey, said her client had left jail with only £4 in his pocket.

He was not involved in rioting but took the doughnuts because he was hungry, having spent his money on tobacco, she said.

She added: ""He can't recall the events because he was drunk but he has expressed remorse.""

Among the others to be sentenced was David Swarbrick, 25, was jailed for two years after he stole £25 worth of Oil of Olay from a Quality Save store in Parker Street, which was unsecured after an earlier attack.

'Thrown away'

Swarbrick, of Aston Old Road, Openshaw, admitted burglary and breach of a suspended sentence order.

Father-of-four Anthony Winder, 38, looted the Swarovski Crystal store and smashed a display cabinet to get an ornamental dog, the court heard.

He was also jailed for two years. The judge told him he had ""made a highly respectable life"" for himself and his family, despite a difficult childhood.

""You should have been at the forefront of leading people away from such activities but you became involved,"" the judge said.

Production halted on Charlie Sheen sitcom after remarks,"Production of Two and A Half Men is halted after remarks by the hit US series' star, Charlie Sheen.",,None,"Image caption Sheen has also appeared in the films Wall Street and Platoon

Production of Two and A Half Men has been halted after remarks by the hit US series' star, Charlie Sheen.

Sheen slammed the programme's producer in a radio interview on Thursday.

The decision was based on the ""totality of Charlie Sheen's statements, conduct and condition"", Warner Bros Television studio and the CBS network said in a joint statement.

The 45-year-old actor has also appeared in the films Wall Street and Platoon.

Production of the show had been postponed since late January after Charlie Sheen, the son of Hollywood actor Martin Sheen, entered rehabilitation for reported drug and alcohol abuse.

The actor's publicist had said earlier on Thursday that Two and a Half Men would resume production next week when Sheen had finished his rehabilitation.

But the statement by CBS and Warner Bros Television was issued after Sheen phoned into a US radio programme to criticise the programme's co-creator Chuck Lorre, as well as Alcoholics Anonymous.

The actor - one of America's highest-paid stars - was taken to hospital in Los Angeles with severe abdominal pains late last month before entering rehab.

He filed for divorce from his third wife, Brooke Mueller, in November, citing irreconcilable differences.

In late October 2009, Sheen was accused of causing damage to a hotel room in New York. After hotel security reported he was disorderly, the actor voluntarily went with authorities for a psychiatric evaluation.","['remarks', 'warner', 'actor', 'charlie', 'television', 'street', 'production', 'radio', 'halted', 'late', 'sitcom', 'sheen', 'reported', 'wall']","Image caption Sheen has also appeared in the films Wall Street and PlatoonProduction of Two and A Half Men has been halted after remarks by the hit US series' star, Charlie Sheen.

Thousands of dangerous drink-drivers are reoffenders,"Almost one in five motorists listed on an official register of the most dangerous drink-drivers has been on it before, the BBC learns through a Freedom of Information request.",,None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Anish Patel, whose wife was killed by a drink driver: ""Something has to be done""

As new figures show the number of people killed in drink-driving crashes rose by 17%, the BBC has discovered that thousands of drink-drivers are repeat offenders.

A fifth of those on a DVLA ""high-risk register"" have been on it before.

There are calls for more stringent checks before offenders are given back their licences.

The government said it had tightened up rules, and drivers now had to prove they were no longer alcohol-dependent.

Drink-drivers who are more than two and a half times over the legal limit, who have two or more drink-drive offences within a 10-year period or who refuse to give breath, blood or urine samples, are classed by the DVLA as ""high-risk offenders"".

Using the Freedom of Information Act, the BBC discovered there are currently 230,149 banned drivers on the DVLA's scheme and of these, 42,207 drivers had been on it before.

Their licences had been returned because they were considered safe to drive when their initial ban expired.

But under rules introduced in June, when a ban expires, offenders can reapply for their licence only when they have passed a medical test to prove they are no longer alcohol-dependent.

However, this will apply only to new offenders - those convicted earlier can drive after reapplying for their driving licence.

Provisional figures released on Thursday show that 280 people were killed in drink-drive accidents in 2012, an increase of about 17% compared with 2011. This accounts for 16% of all road deaths in Britain. Overall, deaths were down 8% on 2011, at 1,754.

Police and road safety campaigners say the system of dealing with drink-drivers needs to be re-examined.

'Bitter experience'

Insp Richard Auty, who has investigated collisions for the Metropolitan Police for 17 years, said he was surprised by the DVLA figure, adding that it was ""quite large"".

He expressed doubts that the new testing system would address the problem.

""I suspect from the people that I've dealt with that whilst it will deal with the worst offenders, the binge drinkers that are able to control it will clearly not turn up to a medical drunk, so it won't effectively deal with those people. So I would suggest a mandatory driving test or extended driving test before you get your licence back would be a much greater deterrent.""

In 2009, Anish Patel's wife, Catriona, 39, was killed by a serial offender while cycling to work. She was crushed under the wheels of his lorry outside Oval tube station in south London.

Image caption The driver of this lorry who killed Catriona Patel had been on a drinking binge the night before. He was jailed for seven years.

The driver had three previous drink-driving convictions, had been disqualified 20 times and had three previous convictions for reckless driving.

Mr Patel said: ""It was just a normal day and a few phone calls later and hours later your whole life gets turned upside down and changed forever. She was my best friend, she was the love of my life, she was my soulmate, we did absolutely everything together.""

He felt angry and bitter when he learned about the driver's previous convictions.

""I just thought the biggest thing that shouldn't have happened that day was him being on the road and driving a 40-tonne tipper truck fully laden through one of the busiest junctions through central London.

""These people obviously are not operating by the same rules of the vast majority of the population operate by and I think that there has to be something done about serial offenders. It is too common an occurrence that people get convicted of drink-driving and they are back on the road either illegal or unfortunately legally. ""

'Get carried away'

Johnny, a former serial drink-driver who stopped drinking through Alcoholics Anonymous, was caught three times in nine weeks.

He was banned for two years and continued to drink-drive for 15 years but was never caught again.

He said: ""I always thought of the consequences but unfortunately just the following morning. I was just going out for one or two drinks, get a bit carried away and invariably I'd end up drink-driving.

""I'm not convinced that a tougher sentence would have made any difference. How much tougher do you want it to be? You're going to lose your liberty, you're going to lose your job, you're going to lose your home. You're going to lose everything basically if you do it again. That never stopped me from driving.""

Amy Aeron-Thomas, executive director of RoadPeace, the national charity for road crash victims, said it was time to review driving bans and increase the number of breathalyser tests.

""There is public support for a five-year ban for first-time offenders. Now you are talking about repeat offenders, big-risk offenders - they deserve lengthy driving bans if not losing their licence permanently.

""We know with the decrease in road policing there are fewer breathalyser tests being given so there is a greater chance of them getting away with it.""

Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: ""Drink-drivers are a menace and it is right that we do everything we can to keep the most high-risk offenders off the road.

""That is why we have tightened up the rules which mean that they now have to take medical tests to prove they are no longer alcohol-dependent before being allowed to drive.""

Ant McPartlin has thanked fans for their support after revealing doctors warned he could have died from his painkiller and alcohol addictions.

In a Twitter post, Ant wrote that he was ""overwhelmed"" by the positive feedback he had received.

The star has received more than 2,000 tweets in response to his message.

Sorry, this Twitter post is currently unavailable.

Ant entered rehab in June , having become addicted to alcohol and prescription painkillers following a knee operation in 2015.

The Bafta-winning star of shows including Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway and I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here! spoke to The Sun on Sunday after spending two months in rehab.

He said his wife Lisa and TV partner and friend Declan Donnelly had encouraged him to seek help.

""I was at the point where anything - prescription drugs, non-prescription drugs - I would take,"" he said.

""And take them with alcohol, which is ridiculous. The doctors told me, 'You could have killed yourself'.""

He told the newspaper that Dec got involved earlier this year after he delayed a second knee operation so he could carry on working on ITV show Britain's Got Talent.

After undergoing surgery following the show's final, McPartlin said he was ""just done"" and after an hour-long chat with Dec, he entered a rehab clinic.

The star is now clean from both prescription drugs and alcohol.

"Detox clinics putting patients at risk in England, regulator finds",The regulator has found many residential rehab clinics are not providing safe or good quality care.,,2017-11-30T08:54:39+00:00,"Image copyright Getty Images

People undergoing detox for alcohol or drug addiction are being put at risk by residential clinics in England - as a lot of the care provided is not safe or good quality, the regulator has found.

The Care Quality Commission based its findings on inspections of the 68 independent services over two years.

Nearly three-quarters were found to be failing in at least one of the fundamental standards of care.

The regulator said detoxification can be ""difficult, unpleasant and risky"".

Last year more than 2,600 people underwent medical detox in a residential rehabilitation service in England - about 1% of the total number being treated for drug and alcohol addiction.

Lasting around five to 10 days, detox can involve fits and hallucinations, as well as a risk of suicide or painkiller drug overdose.

Given this, Dr Paul Lelliott, from the CQC, said he was ""deeply concerned"" because many of the providers of these services in England are not following national clinical guidelines.

Safe care and treatment was where the most breaches were found, with 63% of clinics not meeting this standard when they were first inspected.

Staff were also handling medications incorrectly, administering drugs such as methadone and paracetamol without the right training or too often.

Many clinics were also not assessing safety risks before patients were admitted or following national guidance on how to treat people in withdrawal.

For example, in at least one case, the CQC found staff didn't plan how they would manage a person's epileptic fits during their withdrawal, despite knowing they were at risk of having seizures.

Many staff were also not given full employment checks or sufficient training.

Dr Lelliott said: ""While we have found some services that are providing good care and we are beginning to see improvements, all providers need to review their practice so that we can be assured that they are delivering safe and effective care.

""Detoxification under clinical supervision is often the first stage of a person's addiction treatment. It can be a difficult, unpleasant and sometimes, risky experience. It is vital that providers get this right to support people's onward rehabilitation and recovery.""

Four of the services are no longer operating.

Getting recovery on track

Rosanna O'Connor, at Public Health England, said: ""While residential detox makes up a small part of the overall treatment system, seeing about 1% of all in treatment, they do have a vital role.

""It's crucial these services are in line with best practice, as the clinical guidelines on drug treatment clearly set out.

""This helps ensure not only safety but gives some of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people the best chance of getting their recovery on track.""

The CQC now plans to rate the other independent services that treat people for substance misuse.

Prof Colin Drummond, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the report ""shows systemic failings in the way these services are provided and that people undergoing detoxification are being exposed to unnecessary risks"".

Lincolnshire Student Life,,,None,"Some things worth bearing in mind Now, as students you're here to study but of course unless you abstain for whatever reason the pub and alcohol culture is going to play a major part in your student life. University could be your first sloshed, drunk, ratted, bladdered, inebriated - whatever you want to call it - experience. It could also be the first time you find yourself waking up covered in Marmite (believe me this has happened - although not to me I hasten to add). The main thing to remember is that although you may feel clever drinking alcohol the next day you could feel pretty stupid. Alcohol is great as a social way of getting to know people but be careful you don't up your tolerance level too much. Basically like any drug the more you drink the more you need to get drunk. *WARNING*WARNING*WARNING*WARNING* Frequently drinking can seriously affect your health, causing memory loss and cirrhosis (liver damage). (Am I sounding old saying all this - for some reason I keep thinking of - pot, kettle, black). Calories and weight gain are actually terrible side effects. They're not called 'beer guts' for nothing, and a lot of your work on your BG can be achieved at uni/college if you don't keep yourself fit and healthy in other ways (Wait - I know what you're thinking - and we'll get onto alcoholic sex in a minute). Government guidelines advise safe limits of 3-4 units per day for men and 2-3 for women (half a pint of normal lager or a single whiskey is 1 unit). However, these are only guidelines and do not reflect the drinking habits of young people, especially students. Advice Abstaining from drinking is the only way to not suffer from any drink related side effects, but although sensible it is not realistic for many. Apart from heart disease, weight gain, and unprotected sex through alcohol the worst side effect is probably a hangover. This is your body's reaction to the drink you had the night before. Common symptoms include headaches (caused by dehydration) lack of proper sleep and an unsettled stomach. Preventing dehydration will go a long way to staving off the effects of a hangover, so drink as much water possible. I've usually found a pint at least, with another pint next to the bed is a good measure. Eating light food helps to replenish your body's levels of sugar and salt. Avoid tea and coffee as they tend to dehydrate you, and get plenty of vitamin C - try fresh orange juice. Now you'll probably not be operating at your best for the day so keep an eye on those deadlines - nothing worse than forgetting you had to hand in the essay, concentrate on the 9am lecture and still try and catch his/her eye after the lecture to ask them for a drink that very evening. All this whilst still smelling of Marmite - because you got up too late for a shower (believe me, it did happen). Don't mix too many drinks - whoa that's very bad - Oh yes, you'll be clever whilst you're having them but you'll feel very stupid the next day - give yourself a regular de-tox, to give your liver a break from alcohol for a few days. It will stop you getting bored of drinking and going out and building up the kind of Rasputin - style immunity that will require you to drink a litre of vodka before you go out. After a heavy session remember that you still have alcohol in your system. Many motorists have been convicted of drink-driving when breathalysed the day after a night out. Facts You're more likely to have unprotected sex if you're drunk, and legally, consenting to sex while drunk is still consent. You're four times more likely to have an accident on a bike or in a car if you've had a drink. Each pint of beer contains c.180 calories so watch out for that beer gut. One unit of alcohol =



Half a pint of beer

A glass of wine

A shot of spirits



The reasonable intake for an adult female per week is 14 units. The reasonable intake for an adult male per week is 21 units. It takes approximately one hour to get rid of each unit you drink. Help

Both the Student's Union and the University have an alcohol policy to provide support for students and staff who seek help with alcohol related problems.

Smashed: Mary Elizabeth Winstead on playing an alcoholic,An independent film about an elementary schoolteacher with a drinking problem has been tipped as a potential awards contender. BBC News speaks to its director and stars.,,None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Leading lady Mary Elizabeth Winstead tells the BBC why she took on her most dramatic role to date

A low-budget independent film about an elementary schoolteacher with a drinking problem has been tipped as a potential awards contender. BBC News spoke to its director and stars.

Movie awards voters tend to be impressed by hard-hitting studies of alcoholism, regularly rewarding films that have highlighted the perils of the demon drink.

Ray Milland won an Oscar in 1946 for playing a drunkard in The Lost Weekend, as did Nicolas Cage, 50 years later, for imbibing himself to death in Leaving Las Vegas.

Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne and Jeff Bridges were also given Hollywood's highest accolade for playing characters partial to a tipple.

It can work for actresses too. Elizabeth Taylor received her second Oscar for playing a boozy harridan in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, while Lee Remick got a nomination for going blotto in Days of Wine and Roses.

All of which bodes well for Mary Elizabeth Winstead, whose portrayal of Kate, a young wife trying to stay off the sauce in the independent film Smashed, is being tipped as a dark horse in this year's awards race.

Only last month, she was nominated for a Spirit award, alongside Jennifer Lawrence (from Silver Linings Playbook) and child performer Quvenzhane Wallis (from Beasts of the Southern Wild).

Could an Oscar nomination follow in January? During a visit to London last month, the 28-year-old was studiously playing down her chances.

'Wonderful imagination'

""I'm very aware my chances are not very high so I'm not getting my hopes up,"" says the actress, previously seen in quirky movies like Scott Pilgrim vs The World and Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof.

""But it's lovely to hear anyone say anything like that about a performance I've done, and I certainly can't help but fantasise about the idea of being a part of it in some way.""

""I had seen Mary in big action films like Die Hard 4.0 and the remake of The Thing,"" says Smashed director James Ponsoldt, whose work won a special jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival last January.

Image caption Paul (left) is known to US TV audiences for playing Jesse Pinkman in Breaking Bad

""But spending time with her, I realised what a wonderful imagination she has and how willing she was to really prepare for this role.""

Those sentiments are shared by actor Aaron Paul, who took a break from playing a crystal meth dealer in TV's Breaking Bad to appear as Charlie, Kate's free-spirited, perennially intoxicated husband.

""The goal in this business is to get lost in the scenes and truly feel like you're living moments as if they were your own,"" says the 33-year-old.

""That happened pretty much every day on set with Mary. It was great and a wonderful experience.""

Should accolades come in Smashed's direction, it would be quite a coup for a film shot in just 19 days for a reported $500,000 (£312,557).

Not only that, but it would also surely be the first movie so honoured to feature a teacher publicly relieving herself on a convenience store floor.

For Winstead, used to projecting glamorous self-assurance on red carpets and in photo shoots, fabricating something so indecorous and unladylike must have posed a challenge.

Apparently, though, such considerations were secondary compared to the need to make an artificial bladder function on cue.

'Not propaganda'

""What's funny in scenes like that is that sometimes the technical aspects end up overriding everything else,"" the actress smiles.

""I was wearing this... 'device', and when I sat down I had to put my arm on my leg to activate it.

""And it wasn't working - every take it wasn't working. On every take everyone was behind the camera going, 'Is it going to work?'

""So it really got rid of all of the humiliation of doing that scene, because all the focus was on hoping that it worked and that we could actually get the scene done.""

Winstead's character is driven to seek help from Alcoholics Anonymous, much to the chagrin of her hard-drinking husband.

Image caption The cast of Smashed includes Octavia Spencer (right), who won an Oscar this year for The Help

The film takes a fairly uncritical view of the organisation, which is depicted by Ponsoldt and his co-writer Susan Burke as a benignly tolerant force for social good.

""Susan and I have very complicated feelings towards AA,"" says the director. ""We both know people whose lives have been saved by it, and we know people who left because they thought it was a cult.

""We didn't want to glorify it; this is certainly not a propaganda film. Nor did we want to take easy shots at it.

""We just wanted the scenes at AA to feel honest and true, so we went to great lengths to make sure they were accurate.""

As graphic as Smashed becomes, particularly when Paul and Winstead's characters are at their most inebriated, it is not inconceivable the film could benefit the organisation.

Winstead is happy for it to have a dual purpose, saying it would be ""fantastic"" if the film was ""used in any sort of positive way"".

""People have come up to me after screenings who work with alcoholics and feel it would be a great tool for them to use,"" she says.

""I think the reason they feel that way is it feels more real than other films on the subject, and a lot more relatable to people of this generation.""

'Recovery point'

Smashed is not the only film around at present to have an alcoholic protagonist. Another is Flight, out in the UK in February, in which Denzel Washington plays an airline pilot waging his own battle with the bottle.

Winstead admits it is ""interesting"" for the two to emerge at the same time but insists that they are ""very different films"".

""Smashed is about a person getting their life together, while Flight is about somebody in the throes of alcoholism who can't get to that recovery point,"" she muses.

Image caption Denzel Washington plays a pilot in Flight found to be harbouring a dark secret

""Although they are both anchored and rooted in alcoholism, they tell very different stories.""

""I think it's funny in a quirky, cosmic way that they both came out so close to each other,"" laughs Ponsoldt. ""I just wish we had Flight's marketing budget.

""But I see it as a win for everybody. The world is better when both the independents and studios are making movies for adults that deal with serious issues that pertain to everyone's lives.""

So how does one set about playing an addict? For Aaron Paul, the most effective route to finding his character was also the simplest.

""What I did for research was drink - a lot more than I had ever in my entire life,"" he reveals. ""I filmed myself getting severely intoxicated and I studied the tapes.

""I also went onto YouTube and typed in 'drunk people acting crazy',"" he continues. ""It's incredible what you can find out there.""

Smashed is out in the UK and Ireland on 14 December.","['elizabeth', 'winstead', 'won', 'caption', 'work', 'playing', 'smashed', 'oscar', 'film', 'feel', 'paul', 'mary', 'alcoholic']","Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne and Jeff Bridges were also given Hollywood's highest accolade for playing characters partial to a tipple.

Geoff: ""I'm really happy, really pleased... I'm delighted with how the film looks.



The inspiration? I'd been talking to Ronnie (Fox). We've both known people who've been in NA (Narcotics Anonymous) and AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) and I said 'I could write you a great script'.



If you want to write - just write everyday. In the early days it's more about tenacity than talent. I believe there is nothing beyond our reach""

Jane attends Brum's Theatre School. She lives in Quinton. Jane: ""I'm a bit overwhelmed... I'm just at the beginning of my acting career. It was a wonderful finish to the term - doing some practical work on set. I'll definitely be doing more""

Ann and Brian are retired. Ann is a children's author. Brian follows Warwickshire cricket and collects autographs. They live in Quinton and are the parents of Rose, the film's first assistant director.



Ann: ""When she (Rose) wants people for the crowd scene we jump in with both feet. We are very proud of her - pleased at how she's been so determined.

The crew member: Rose Wilde Rose Wilde worked as first assistant director on 'Brown Paper Bag'. She lives in Bearwood and London. Rose: ""I worked on Bouncer (the other Geoff Thompson film). I'm working on the new Harry Potter film at the moment - when that finishes I hope to make my own short film. I mean, I am going to do my own short film.""



The producer: Mark Leveson The producer: Mark Leveson Mark is co-producer (with Natasha Carlish) of 'Brown Paper Bag'. His glittering CV includes the co-creation of C4's 'Whose line is it anyway?' He commutes between London and Bearwood. Mark: ""This film is our calling card. It allows you to go to the larger companies and say 'imagine what we could do with proper funding'.

Food addiction: could overeating be compulsive?,Alcoholism researcher Sally Marlow examines whether food addiction could be fuelling a rise in obesity,,None,"Image copyright Science Photo Library

Scientists are divided over whether or not addiction could be contributing to rising global obesity. Does food addiction really exist and - if it does - how can it be treated?

Getting a grip on addiction can be incredibly hard, as anyone who has ever tried to give up smoking, alcohol or even caffeine will testify.

A tried and tested tactic is to avoid the thing you're addicted to - giving up going to pubs for a while, or not to have cigarettes in the house.

Even with these measures people often struggle and fail repeatedly.

But what if the thing you are addicted to has to be kept in the house, and worse, has to be something you sit down in front of three times a day?

As obesity levels continue to rise, the scientific community is starting to look for similarities between overeating and addiction.

The EU has funded a project called NeuroFAST to bring all the evidence together.

About the author Sally Marlow is an alcohol addiction researcher at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London. She has reported on alcohol for Radio 4's Today programme and for Inside Health

Researchers are cautious. So far there is only one type of eating disorder where it is thought addiction plays a role: Binge Eating Disorder, a side effect of which is often obesity.

Although we tend to trivialise the idea of addiction and food being related - many of us have at some point referred to ourselves as addicted to chocolate - Binge Eating Disorder is something which holds people within its grip.

It causes physical and psychological harm and is utterly miserable. Just like other forms of addiction.

One of the people I spoke to as part of my research, Michael, is an articulate, educated professional and a former overeater.

He said: ""It's difficult for others to understand. Everyone overeats and they think it's just a bigger version of that.

""It's a completely different experience - a constant, daily minute-to-minute obsession about getting the substance, food.

""It is hell being there in that place.""

Louise, another of those I met, provides a compelling testimony for addiction being at work in overeating.

She also had a serious alcohol problem and understands addiction more than most.

""I think what's most interesting is the similarities in behaviour,"" she says.

What is Binge Eating Disorder? A feeling of compulsion to overeat on a regular basis, sometimes including pre-planned binges

Those affected consume large amounts of food in a short time, often when they are not hungry

Overeating usually happens in private, leaving the person feeling out of control or guilty

The disorder is linked to obesity and conditions like high blood pressure and heart disease

Treatments include anti-depressants and cognitive therapies Source: NHS

""As an alcoholic I would go to different off-licences to buy my alcohol so people wouldn't recognise me, but I'd also go to different newsagents to buy chocolate so they wouldn't recognise me.

""Sneaking it into the house, not wanting people to see, hiding food, like an alcoholic hiding bottles, hiding empties.""

Dr Nora Volkow, a prominent neuroscientist and head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse in the United States, is clear in her mind that there are biological processes underpinning what Michael and Louise describe.

She has found that a neurotransmitter called dopamine, which is known to be involved in addiction, behaves in the brain in the same way in those who are heavily addicted to drugs and those who are obese.

For her this is strong evidence that food, or eating, can be addictive.

Not everybody agrees. Professor Jane Ogden, a psychologist at the University of Surrey, believes the label of addiction can be unhelpful for those who overeat - it removes personal responsibility and hinders recovery.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The number of obese people in the UK has more than trebled in 25 years

""The addiction world has given us a strong narrative that says you have no control - things in your brain are wanting more sugar or chocolate"" she says.

But if food is like other addictions, we should theoretically see overlaps in successful treatments.

Addiction treatment has a goal of either complete abstinence or reducing harm - for example by prescribing methadone or nicotine gum.

For those working towards abstinence, one tried and tested model is the 12-step programme developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, with versions for drugs used by Narcotics Anonymous and gambling by Gamblers Anonymous.

Twenty years ago people were reluctant to accept that gambling could be addictive, but now there is widespread acceptance of this idea

Michael and Louise are both members of Overeaters Anonymous. It works in much the same way as the other 12-step programmes with peer-led group confidential meetings, personal mentors, and a structured programme of steps to work through.

There is no doubt that for some it's highly successful, just like Alcoholics Anonymous can be.

It's not possible to abstain from eating, of course, but it is possible to abstain from overeating.

For Louise, abstinence is three healthy meals a day, no wheat and no chocolate. For Michael his abstinence food plan is determined by his sponsor - he is told by someone else what he is allowed to eat.

Other treatments are more radical.

In alcohol addiction, the body can be altered so that it rejects alcohol by implanting a drug known as antabuse.

If alcohol is consumed, the body reacts with nausea.

Similarly in overeating, the body can be altered by bariatric surgery - a gastric band, bypass or sleeve, which restricts the volume of the stomach available for food.

It sounds extreme but it works for most people, and the evidence shows the risks of surgery are far outweighed by the health benefits of losing excess weight.

People live longer, and have fewer heart and mobility problems. Diabetes is even reversed in some cases, and people report a massively improved quality of life.

The possible relationships between food and addiction are incredibly complicated, and there is a lot we do not yet understand.

Twenty years ago people were reluctant to accept that gambling could be addictive, but now there is widespread acceptance of this idea, and good evidence to support it.

Are we at the same place with food - waiting for the evidence and attitudes to change?

Nicola Schlesinger, a counsellor, works with women who have addiction problems and eating disorders. What would she say to those scientists who do not believe food can be addictive?

""They don't necessarily have the people sitting in front of them that I have on a daily basis in tears, in pain, hating themselves, feeling suicidal,"" she says.

""They can say what they like but in the end we still have to deal with the reality of the situation as it presents itself.""

Hopefully NeuroFAST and others will move us closer to narrowing the gap between scientists on both sides of the debate, and find solutions for people who do feel a compulsion to overeat.

World Tonight: News of the World: no reason to celebrate?,The World Tonight blog,,None,"So will you be buying a last copy of the News of the World on Sunday? A souvenir, to show to your grand-children: ""This is what we used to call a newspaper""?

Maybe not. Maybe you've never bought a copy in your life, and have no intention of starting now. Maybe you're delighted that a tabloid rag (your words, not mine) has finally been forced out of business.

Well, I hope you'll forgive me, but I'm a journalist, and I can never celebrate the death of a newspaper. Yes, of course, the News of the World is guilty of some appalling errors - it has behaved shockingly and it has paid the price.

But, as we pointed out on last night's programme, its record is not all bad. Some of its investigations really were in the public interest, and not just of interest to the public. (A fine distinction, I know, but a crucial one when we start discussing what is and is not a legitimate investigation.)

I'm a former Fleet Street news editor. (Or perhaps, in the style of Alcoholics Anonymous, I should say: ""My name is Robin and I am a recovering Fleet Street news editor."")

I never worked for a mass circulation Sunday paper (the one I worked for sold a tiny fraction of the copies the News of the World sells every week) - but I do know a little bit about the pressure to get stories.

So over the past few days, several people have asked me why on earth journalists would even think about trying to hack into the voicemail messages of bereaved military families or missing schoolgirls.

It's quite a simple question to answer. What matters more than anything to reporters is that they get good stories printed in the paper - preferably at the top of the page, even better on the front page.

That makes their editors happy, because it makes the proprietor happy, because it means the paper will sell more copies. As the former information commissioner Richard Thomas put it in his prescient report ""What price privacy?"", published more than five years ago: ""Journalists have a voracious demand for personal information, especially at the popular end of the market. The more information they reveal about celebrities or anyone remotely in the public eye, the more newspapers they can sell.""

Do newspaper readers want to read about tragedy and heartbreak? Do they lap up heartrending tales of grief and suffering? You know the answer as well as I do.

(And if you don't believe me, just look at the numbers. Biggest selling newspaper in the UK? News of the World.)

I sometimes liken journalists to undertakers. They both perform an essential task, but the detail of how they do it does not always make pleasant reading. If journalists break the law (and hacking into people's voicemail messages is illegal, just as paying a police officer to disclose information is), then they face prosecution. And a jury will decide whether what they did was in the public interest.

There will now be enormous pressure on the press to clean up their act and strengthen the monitoring of their behaviour. It would not in the least surprise me if the Press Complaints Commission, which two years ago concluded that there was nothing much to worry about in the phone-hacking allegations (""the Commission could not help but conclude that the Guardian's stories did not quite live up to the dramatic billing they were initially given"") is now quietly put out of its misery.

In a statement on Wednesday, it admitted that ""it can no longer stand by its 2009 report on phone hacking and the assertions made in it."" But if it is replaced, you'd better be prepared for many months of anguished debate about the correct balance to be struck between press freedom and the right to privacy.

Ed Miliband called in a speech this morning for the Commission to be replaced by something with much sharper teeth. Trouble is it's a very slippery slope from a system of regulation that includes the power to impose sanctions to a system of government licensing of newspapers.

As the former chairman of the PCC, Sir Christpher Meyer, commented: ""If Ed Miliband wants a press watchdog to be able to take evidence on oath, and have police powers of investigation, that's state not self-regulation.""

If it comes to a choice between entrusting our freedoms to government or to newspapers, I am sometimes reminded of Thomas Jefferson: ""If it were left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.""

Let the debate begin.","['journalists', 'newspapers', 'reason', 'public', 'commission', 'know', 'press', 'celebrate', 'paper', 'information', 'world', 'newspaper', 'tonight']","So will you be buying a last copy of the News of the World on Sunday?

Play centre founder admits filming girls in changing rooms,"Married father-of-two Darren Johnson ""stalked"" girls changing after swimming lessons.",,2018-08-28T18:38:03+00:00,"Image copyright Metropolitan Police/PA Wire Image caption Married father-of-two Darren Johnson filmed girls getting changed after swimming lessons

The co-founder of a children's play centre filmed youngsters undressing after swimming lessons, a court heard.

Former Eddie Catz director Darren Johnson used ""peepholes"" to film women and girls in toilets and changing rooms at a leisure centre for children.

The number of victims is not known, but a police officer involved in the case estimated it may be as many as 40.

Johnson, 51, from Putney, south-west London, admitted five counts of voyeurism over a 12-year period.

He was caught when two 14-year-old girls spotted his camera-phone from under the cubicle adjacent to them and alerted staff, Kingston Crown Court heard.

'Stalked children'

After Johnson was identified in CCTV footage, police seized two computers containing hundreds of images of women in various states of undress.

Johnson admitted voyeurism between 1 January 2005 and 5 June 2017.

Two of the charges relate to filming the 14-year-old girls, while a third relates to images of women taken under cubicles at a leisure centre.

Two more charges relate to images of women taken through ""peepholes"" in toilets and changing rooms at an Eddie Catz soft play centre.

His defence lawyer claimed Johnson had not meant to film teenagers.

However, prosecutor Lauren Sales said CCTV shows Johnson ""stalking children around the leisure centre"".

""He attended the leisure centre at times when schools have swim classes,"" she added.

""He goes up to the swimming pool, sees the kids, sees them using the facilities, stalks them to the shower area... and uses the cubicle next to them.""

Image copyright Google Image caption Johnson founded the children's soft play centre company, Eddie Catz, with his wife

Johnson, who founded Eddie Catz with his wife, resigned from the business as soon as the allegations came to light.

The company has centres in Earlsfield, Putney, Wimbledon and Newbury, as well as a presence in branches of Mothercare in Leeds, Gateshead, Manchester, Solihull and Bristol.

Defence lawyer Tom Williams said Johnson was plagued by alcohol problems and marriage troubles.

""He is truly sorry for what he has done and has done everything he can to address those things in his life which pushed him into an extremely dark place in that period,"" Mr Williams said.

Johnson has attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and classes for sex addicts since his arrest, the court heard.

Judge Andrew Campbell said Johnson would be sentenced on Wednesday.","['johnson', 'girls', 'catz', 'leisure', 'centre', 'images', 'rooms', 'filming', 'eddie', 'admits', 'changing', 'founder', 'play', 'women', 'swimming']","Former Eddie Catz director Darren Johnson used ""peepholes"" to film women and girls in toilets and changing rooms at a leisure centre for children.

Paul Gascoigne given suspended drink-driving sentence,Former footballer Paul Gascoigne is given an eight-week suspended sentence after admitting driving while over the legal alcohol limit.,,None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Paul Gascoigne arriving at Newcastle Magistrates' Court for sentencing

Former footballer Paul Gascoigne has been given a suspended prison sentence after he admitted drinking and driving.

The 43-year-old Tyneside-born former England midfielder was stopped by police in Newcastle on 8 October.

The city's magistrates' court was told that Gascoigne was more than four times the legal alcohol limit.

He was handed an eight-week sentence, suspended for a year, and banned from driving for three years. He was also given an alcohol treatment order.

The court was told Gascoigne was five weeks into a 12-week anti-drink programme in Dorset.

Gascoigne, who played top flight football for Newcastle, Tottenham, Lazio, Rangers, Everton and Middlesbrough in a career spanning nearly 20 years, also attends Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings.

I hope not to see you again District Judge Stephen Earl Profile: Paul Gascoigne

His solicitor Stephen Andrews said: ""The talk now is of an extensive and elongated period of support while not actually under the roof of the Providence Project, but certainly within easy reach, given the continued support they would propose to offer.

""Previously, it has been on his terms. He's gone in, he has used it as he saw fit and of course relapsed because he has not done the full programme.

""This time it has been on their terms.""

District Judge Stephen Earl said he believed a 12-week sentence, with a third off as credit for a guilty plea, was appropriate.

He said the sentence was suspended in recognition of Gascoigne's progress in the treatment programme.

'Toon Army'

He warned the former footballer that if he re-offended in the next 12 months, the jail term would be triggered.

District Judge Earl added: ""I hope not to see you again.""

Gascoigne made no comment when he left court, but Mr Andrews said he was relieved and that it was a ""good result"".

Outside the court well-wishers shouted, ""Toon Army never surrenders"", and he signed autographs for fans.

He then got into his lawyer's car which became stuck in heavy snow in the car park behind the court.

The vehicle - which sported a Manchester City pendant on the passenger window - was pushed free by members of the press.

Gascoigne is also due to be tried on a separate charge of drinking and driving, which he denies.

Mary Queen Of Shops

Earlier this year, fashion guru Mary Portas galvanised some of the saddest shop floors in Britain into adopting a radical new approach to turn around their fortunes.

Now Mary returns to the High Streets of Britain to revitalise five more fashion shops that have lost their way.

Mary famously reinvented Harvey Nichols, but her passion is re-energising independent stores which can bring a new flavour and excitement to the High Street – and she's got her work cut out reinvigorating drippy sales staff, banishing dodgy clothes and turning dowdy shops into fashion Meccas.

This time around, Mary is pulling in help from the High Street giants to put struggling suburban shopkeepers through their paces. Rails of bad-taste disasters are banished to make way for fashion must-haves, giving owners and viewers alike the inside track on the latest trends hitting the High Street and how to get the most out of that popular hobby – shopping.

Never Better

Stephen Mangan stars as Keith, the wrong person trying to do the right thing, in a brand-new comedy series. A recovering alcoholic in his mid-thirties, Keith doesn't realise that alcohol was the least of his problems. Indeed, while he manages to stay on the wagon, his sobriety brings crisis and destruction to those around him.

At his Alcoholics Anonymous meetings he creates chaos, endangering the recovery of his fellow 12-steppers. At home, his wife and two children have to cope with Keith's new extreme attentiveness and misfiring determination to be a good dad and husband.

Never Better is about a recovery that never progresses and family time that never fails to go wrong. The cast also includes Kate Ashfield as Keith's wife, Anita, and Tom Goodman-Hill as his best friend, Richard.

Paradise Or Bust

Paradise Or Bust follows the dream of two 26-year-olds, Ben Keene and Mark Bowness. With no experience and little money, they've leased a paradise island in Fiji, started a website and hope that up to 5,000 strangers from around the world will join their website community, or ""tribe"", and help them build an eco-tourist village. It is the biggest challenge of their lives.

The reality of their dream, however, is no toilet, no water, no shelter, no broadband connection, financial crises and relationships that are tested to the limit.

This remarkable series follows the first year in the life of Tribewanted.com and tells the personal journeys, business challenges and logistical complexities of creating an eco-village on a deserted island.

After battling fires, insect infestations, severe water shortages and living through a coup d'état, the boys face their greatest test – to not destroy the very beauty they went there to find. A year on, have they found paradise – or hell on Earth?

Ski Sunday

A revamped Ski Sunday celebrates its 30th season as it returns to BBC Two in a new, high-profile, early evening slot, with presenters Ed Leigh and Graham Bell bringing their unique blend of fun, daring and exploration to ski slopes across the world.

In Graham's Great Adventure, Graham takes in the historical, geographical and sporting insights of a summer trek across the Alps and Dolomites. Meanwhile, Ed locates some of the more unusual places in the world in which to snowboard, capturing the colour and culture of these countries along the way.

But it's not only Ed and Graham who will be taking to the slopes and mountainsides: a series of celebrities are put to the test over two slalom runs to see just how much they can improve on their skills following a day of intense training.","['bbc', 'street', 'wrong', 'world', 'graham', 'high', 'fashion', '2008', 'mary', 'ed', 'ms', 'winterspring', 'programmes', 'series']","BBC Two Winter/Spring 2008Programmes M-SMary Queen Of ShopsEarlier this year, fashion guru Mary Portas galvanised some of the saddest shop floors in Britain into adopting a radical new approach to turn around their fortunes.

"When the US president travels, the world stands still",Life in a security bubble is necessary for the president – and claustrophobic. Here’s an insider’s account.,,None,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Not quite a simple walk in the park when Dad is the president of the United States

US President Barack Obama pines for the moment when he can leave the security bubble. After 24 hours inside it, I can see why.

Mr Obama and his daughter Sasha, 14, walk across a tarmac in New York on Friday. He taps her shoulder and points towards Manhattan, showing her the world, or at least his version of it.

What a place.

They fly on Air Force One to one of New York's airports - and minutes later arrive by helicopter in Manhattan.

Streets are blocked off, and their motorcade glides to the Upper East Side. They run red lights - at least 26 over the weekend. Along the way people cheer. At one point a woman in a flowery sundress holds up a handmade sign: ""FREE HUGS"".

It's a New York fantasy, one of the perks of Mr Obama's job. He travels in a security zone, a ""bubble"" as it's known - a tightly managed network of aircrafts, vehicles and communication that lets him move easily around the world.

Image caption At a briefing Mr Obama says he likes to travel when he's free to go where he wants

The bubble provides safety, but it's confining. In a recent briefing he sounded wistful about an upcoming trip to Kenya, his father's homeland. He made it clear he'd rather go without security restrictions.

""I'll be honest with you, visiting Kenya as a private citizen is probably more meaningful to me than visiting as president,"" Mr Obama said. ""Because I can actually get outside of a hotel room or a conference centre.""

He still has 18 months left in the bubble, though. For that reason it's worth looking at the experience - and considering what it means in terms of his worldview.

The presidential bubble is thick - and pricey. Mr Obama rides in the motorcade in a limousine known as the Beast, which is designed to withstand bullets and chemical attacks.

Mr Obama flies on a Boeing 747 jet that costs $180,000 (£116,000) per hour to operate - and can be refuelled in the middle of a flight. Electronic equipment on board is designed to withstand all kinds of duress, including force from an electromagnetic pulse, according to White House officials.

On the aircraft Mr Obama has a suite with its own bathroom, as well as an office and a conference room. He has access to classified material, and he can communicate with military officials if the US is under attack or is facing another kind of emergency.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Obama shows his daughter around New York - under tight security

There is a saying in the UK that everything smells like fresh paint to the Queen because wherever she goes, things are done up. Here in the US presidents are treated like royalty.

When you climb onto Air Force One, it smells like leather. The seats are business-class sized, even in the back.

I'm a new ""supplementary"" member of the ""travel pool"", a group of journalists who accompany Mr Obama on trips so they can report on what's euphemistically known as a ""transformative moment"" - for example, if the president gets shot. It also gives reporters a chance to experience in a visceral way presidential life on the road.

As we get settled, a flight attendant brings out cool white towels and a basket with grapes, bananas and oranges.

Almond Joy and Baby Ruth candy bars are displayed on a table near a row of magazines in white binders. I put a box of M&M's with a presidential seal in my bag.

Two cameramen watch golf on television. ""Atlantic City,"" says one, looking out of the window. ""It's much cleaner from up here.""

Image copyright AP

Everything in the bubble, including the Jersey shore, looks scrubbed.

Even my colleagues and I are ""clean"", since we've been ""wanded"" (swept by hand-held metal detectors) and inspected by bomb-sniffing German shepherds.

Once you're in the bubble, you can't chat with those who aren't ""clean"".

Image copyright AFP

This keeps the president safe. It also cuts you off from the world - and shows the cloistered nature of the one he inhabits.

Mr Obama has to stoop slightly when he gets on board the helicopter in New York so he doesn't bump his head.

Afterwards my colleagues and I head across the tarmac to an Osprey aircraft, propellers spinning.

The gusts of air are hot and fierce, and I almost lose my footing. The aircraft shakes in the air, and you can feel it vibrate in your throat. I see a red buoy in churning water, like a fragment from a Turner painting, and we fly over South Street Seaport.

FDR Drive on the east side of Manhattan is closed down for our motorcade. Traffic is blocked for miles.

""Wave like the queen,"" a friend in Boston had advised me.

Police line the streets on the Upper East Side, where Mr Obama attends a Democratic fundraiser. Nearby a mailbox has a padlock and a red sign: ""This collection box has been locked."" This makes it harder to stuff it with explosives.

Image caption In New York Mr Obama is protected by police officers - and dump trucks

In other places, dump trucks block the streets. Gravel is piled in the back of one truck marked ""sanitation"".

The following morning the president is chewing gum on a walk near Central Park's Sheep Meadow. ""We love you, Obama,"" someone calls out.

Secret Service officers wade through the grass, checking for bombs and assassins.

Afterwards Mr Obama goes to a Broadway play.

A worker from a nearby French restaurant says they closed for a couple hours because of the security. ""Not a big deal,"" he says, adding they haven't lost much business. ""One or two tables.""

A lanky man named Michael, who's carrying an iced coffee, walks up. A police officer stops him. ""I'm trying to get to a place upstairs,"" Michael says.

""An AA meeting,"" he tells me, referring to Alcoholics Anonymous, afterwards. ""I happen to be in the wrong place at the right time,"" he says. Like others in New York, he takes it in his stride.

Image copyright AP

For the president, though, the bubble is more than an inconvenience.

After six years in the bubble, he's been accused of showing impatience with those who disagree with him, especially when they work on Capitol Hill.

When making a case for the Iran deal, he says, dismissively, to members of Congress - ""read the agreement"".

The bubble makes things worse. You're surrounded by people who are pre-screened and see the world the way you do.

Image copyright AP

After the show he rides through Times Square. Hundreds of people are cheering, but the motorcade windows are rolled up. The world is muffled and distant.

You can see the crowds, but you can't hear them. You simply float by.","['motorcade', 'travels', 'bubble', 'caption', 'president', 'copyright', 'obama', 'stands', 'security', 'mr', 'world', 'york']","""I'll be honest with you, visiting Kenya as a private citizen is probably more meaningful to me than visiting as president,"" Mr Obama said.

'How I lost my dad to alcohol addiction',When Charlotte's dad was taken to hospital he couldn't open his mouth any more.,,None,"When Charlotte's dad was taken to hospital he couldn't open his mouth any more.

His face was paralysed and his heart and liver had become enlarged after years of drinking far too much alcohol.

Then one by one, his internal organs shut down. He died just before Christmas last year, aged 59.

But Charlotte, 27, tells Newsbeat she feels like she lost him to alcohol addiction years ago.

""In your teenage years you become more aware of your parents' behaviour,"" she says.

""I'd realise that finding bottles of wine hidden behind the sofa isn't normal. Finding dad passed out in front of the television at two o'clock in the morning isn't normal.""

I'd realise that finding bottles of wine hidden behind the sofa isn't normal

Hiding it

Charlotte was about 15 when she realised her dad, Iain Hayman, was having problems with alcohol.

""The older I got the more I realised his relationship with alcohol was incredibly unhealthy because he was hiding it. He'd lie to mum and say, 'I haven't had a drink today' and you'd think, 'I saw you earlier. Yes you did.'

""We never knew how much he was drinking. It started off with a bottle of wine a night and then it would go up to three or four.

""Every time you find a bottle of wine you struggle with 'Do I dob him in and cause an argument or do I lie to my mum?'

""The more you tidied, the more you found out about dad.""

'It's quite an embarrassing illness'

Charlotte explains how her father was effectively ""living two lives"".

""I'd come home from school and he'd be asleep in bed. He'd be really down,"" she says.

""It was a slow deterioration. Every time he felt positive you really wanted to get behind him and support him, which is what he needed..

I'll have days when I remember the nice things, and then there are days when I have the horrible memories

""But the more it happened and the more he failed, it became difficult to put that aside.

""He was living two lives because until I was 18 it didn't really come out that he was an alcoholic

""He hid very well that he wasn't paying the mortgage [on our house].

""It came out that we were really close to losing the house. We had bailiffs knocking on the door.

""I was working in the village pub and you'd often be told stories like 'Charlotte, I saw your dad passed out on the path and I almost tripped over him.'

""It's quite an embarrassing illness for your parent to have because they lose their inhibitions and don't care what people think of them.""

Daddy's girl

""I was a proper daddy's girl. We were very close.

Your teenage years are difficult enough. To have that as an extra worry, you just don't need it.

""I have so many nice memories of him. I'll have days when I remember the nice things, and then there are days when I have the horrible memories and I think of him drunk, and I think of him not able to stop for us.

""It's a mixed bag of emotions because you have the anger that he did this to himself.""

Role reversal

""It was a role reversal because you end up looking out for him and making sure he gets ready for the day. And then always worrying about what he was doing.

""Your teenage years are difficult enough. To have that as an extra worry, you just don't need it.

""You should be able to rely on your parents to help you and support you, and it just wasn't there [from him]. Emotionally it's very difficult.""

I distanced myself from him

After years of struggling with the effects of Iain's addiction, Charlotte's mum decided she couldn't take any more. She asked him to move out of their home last year.

Sadly, that's when his drinking increased. He'd lost his job and even began stealing alcohol.

""In the last year I distanced myself from him because I found it too difficult. You really wanted to get behind him and support him, but the more he failed [to stop drinking] it became difficult to put that aside.

""He was in a bad way again, he was out of breath. And then he ended up fainting, got an ambulance to the hospital, and then he never came out.

""He couldn't even talk for the last three weeks of his life.

""You have this anger that he's done this to himself. But we all just had to put it to one side and we just had to be forgiving.

""Now we can grieve the man we lost when I was a teenager.""

Stafford bishop accuses government over alcohol abuse,,,2011-06-01 11:51:59,"The Bishop of Stafford has criticised the government for ""doing little"" to prevent alcohol abuse.

The Rt Rev Geoff Annas has described alcohol misuse as ""one of the major sins of our time"".

Writing in a pastoral letter, published in parish magazines across the Diocese of Lichfield, he called for a ""seismic shift"" in attitudes towards drinking.

The government has said it is tackling alcohol-related crime ""at its source"" through a variety of measures.

He said charities were left to tackle the effects of ""this drug abuse"", with government action not going far enough.

'Major sin'

In January, ministers unveiled plans to set a minimum price for alcohol in England and Wales.

They said banning shops and bars from selling drinks for less than the tax paid on them would cut crime and set a ""base price"" for the first time.

It works out at 38p for a can of weak lager and £10.71 for a litre of vodka.

In the letter, Mr Annas said: ""One definition of 'sin' is anything that comes between us and God and makes us less than the person God created us to be.

""Alcohol abuse is one of the major 'sins' of our time - and it is one that governments do very little to prevent.

""Instead, it is left to amazing organisations like Alcoholics Anonymous or in the inspirational O'Connor Gateway Charitable Trust, of which I am proud to be a trustee, to tackle the effects of this drug abuse.""

'Drink at home'

""Binge-drinking"" was not the fault of pub and nightclub owners, he said, nor was it down to an extension in opening hours.

""The extension of the licensing laws means that they can stay open later but in reality many [people] now do not even arrive until 11 at night,"" said Mr Annas.

""Prior to this they drink in their own homes, consuming alcohol which they have purchased very cheaply in their local supermarket or corner shop.

""The government has introduced minimum pricing but the level it has been set is derisory.""

A Home Office spokesman said the government was tackling alcohol related crime at its source by taking tough action against irresponsible premises, giving communities a chance to have a say over licensing and allowing councils to charge more for late licences.

""And we haven't just stood by while suppliers let drink be sold so cheaply that it leads to drunken violence, we've taken steps to ensure that by the end of the year the sale of alcohol below cost is banned,"" the spokesman said.","['abuse', 'alcohol', 'accuses', 'tackling', 'set', 'stafford', 'spokesman', 'source', 'price', 'tackle', 'sins', 'crime', 'mr', 'bishop']","The Bishop of Stafford has criticised the government for ""doing little"" to prevent alcohol abuse.

Bournemouth's underage drinkers,"A report indicates the number of young people needing help with drink-related illnesses is on the rise in Bournemouth, but why are the figures for the town so high, and how can underage drinkers be helped?",,2008-07-09 00:00:00,"The number of under-18s seeking treatment as a result of drinking alcohol is on the increase in Bournemouth.

A report by Bournemouth and Poole Primary Care Trust indicates that worrying numbers of teenagers are needing treatment for complications resulting from alcohol abuse.

Help playing audio/video

The figures show that 142 under 18-year-olds were admitted to the Royal Bournemouth Hospital with problems related to alcohol over the past two years, the youngest being only three years old.

The figures are 34% higher the national average, and one reason could be because of Bournemouth's large number of 24-hour licenses, suggests Alison Rogers, chief executive of the Ringwood-based British Liver Trust.

Bournemouth has around 52 24 hour licenses She says: ""[The figures] are shocking but not entirely surprising.

""Bournemouth's opted to go for a high density of 24 hour licenses, I think there are 52. Southampton has taken the opposite approach and only allowed one or two, so I don't think we can be surprised there's a correlation between these figures.""

Nationwide, a third of 14-year-olds and half of 15-year-olds drink alcohol on a weekly basis.

And over 1,000 children under 13 need emergency treatment for alcohol poisoning every year.

Seeking help

Chris and Chrissy are two young Bournemouth teenagers who have had problems with alcohol.

The figures in Bournemouth are higher than average Chrissy first started drinking when she was 15. She would go down to the beach and then when she woke up the next day she wouldn't remember anything of her previous night.

She says: ""I had lots of problems and drinking took everything away.""

Chris started drinking at 11 and found it led him into trouble with the police, but now both Chris and Chrissy are getting the help they need.

Specialist agencies

A starting point for help is the town's youth service team. Geraint Griffiths is an Area Team Leader. He says:

""We have a detached youth work team who go out on the streets and meet up with people who may be drinking, and they will encourage them to get involved with more positive activities instead of the drinking and be able to refer them to other specialist agencies who can help them.""

PC Dave Fish agrees. Part of the Licensing Team for the town, he says the police can deal with the crime and disorder consequences of underage drinking, but he says the solution to the problem lies with a co-operative 'multi-agency' approach - the police, the PCT, the council, the licensees, the retailers - all working together.

Jail for trucker caught almost six times drink drive limit,A man who drove a 12-tonne lorry while almost six times the drink-driving limit is jailed for four months.,,None,"Image copyright Google Image caption Stirling Sheriff Court was told James Gallagher has a previous drink driving conviction

A man who drove a 12-tonne lorry while almost six times the drink-driving limit has been jailed for four months.

A court was told motorists contacted police to report James Gallagher's white Scania being driven erratically on the M80.

Gallagher, 49, was stopped by officers near Pirnhall Services, Stirling and found to be smelling strongly of alcohol.

He was also banned from driving for three years at Stirling Sheriff Court.

The court was told that Gallagher was stopped by police at 14:25 and, despite having had his last drink the previous night, was still 5.95 times the legal limit.

Gallagher, of Tillicoultry, Clackmannanshire, pleaded guilty to drink driving, and confessed to a social worker who prepared a background report that he would routinely drive his tipper truck with the same amount of alcohol in his body.

Previous conviction

The court heard he had a previous conviction for drink-driving in 1998, when he was banned for 14 months.

James McLean, defending, said his client was ashamed of his actions, and had been attending Alcoholics Anonymous.

He asked the court not to jail Gallagher, but to impose a community sentence instead.

Sheriff Wyllie Robertson told Gallagher: ""You were nearly six times the limit, and that is a significant figure from the point of view of the level of impairment.

""What is of equal concern is that you were driving an HGV, a 12-tonne tipper lorry, and you had been doing it all day, and it is clear that this alcohol level arose from alcohol you had drunk the previous evening.

""These are huge aggravations for a serious offence, and in these circumstances there is no sentence other than a custodial sentence that is appropriate.""","['stirling', 'driving', 'drink', 'alcohol', 'previous', 'caught', 'gallagher', 'sentence', 'told', 'drive', 'limit', 'times', 'court', 'jail', 'trucker']","Image copyright Google Image caption Stirling Sheriff Court was told James Gallagher has a previous drink driving convictionA man who drove a 12-tonne lorry while almost six times the drink-driving limit has been jailed for four months.

Many thanks, GrannyE and kind regards to your Mother. Annie B from the usual They have always been known as fly cemeteries where I hail from. Dianne from Glasga (or Glasgow) yep, fly's cemetery here too scallowawife from shetland they are fly cemeterys in canada too al rodda from brampton, ont, canada On a recent trip to Scotland, I learned the recipe I've been searching for since my great grandma passed away is not called currant slices, but is locally known as fly cemetery! Would love if someone could share the recipe. carol from chicago, il The recipe bellow is the one that was sent to me 15 years ago from a member of the Daughters of Scotia Lodge. My grandmother, her sister and my aunt belonged to the lodge when they were alive. Here’s the recite: FLY CEMETERY FILLING 1 LB. - CURRANTS OR RAISINS 1 CUP - BROWN SUGAR 2 TABLESPOONS - CORNSTARCH COVER WITH WATER AND SIMMER A FEW MINUTES (2 OR 3 MINUTES). ADD 2 TABLESPOONS OF CORNSTARCH DISSOLVED IN A LITTLE COLD WATER ADD CORNSTARCH AFTER THE FIRST THREE MINUTES OF COOKING). ADD CURRANTS OR RAISINS AND COOK A FEW MINUTES (4 MINUTES). CHILL IN REFRIGERATOR OVERNIGHT. PASTRY 5 1/2 CUPS - FLOUR 1 LB. LARD COMBINE THE FOLLOWING: 1 EGG, 1 TABLESPOON - VINEGAR, AND WATER TO MAKE 1 CUP OF LIQUID. (POUR 1/3 OF LIQUID IN ONE PART OF FLOUR, MIX; THEN POUR THE NEXT 1/3; MIX, THEN POUR THE LAST 1/3 OF LIQUID INTO THE PASTRY, MIX AND KNEED THE DOUGH.) WRAP THE DOUGH AND REFRIGERATE DOUGH OVERNIGHT. THEN, DIVIDE DOUGH INTO 1/3'S. TO FORM THE BOTTOM OF THE CAKE, ROLL THE FIRST PASTRY ON THE TRAY FOR THE BOTTOM. SPREAD FILLING INTO THE BOTTOM PASTRY. MAKE THE TOP LAYER OF PASTRY BY USING ANOTHER 1/3 OF THE PASTRY. PLACE THIS DOUGH BETWEEN TWO SHEETS OF WAXED PAPER AND ROLL OUT TO FORM THE TOP. PLACE OVER THE TOP OF THE FILLING. CRIMP THE TOP AND BOTTOM PASTRIES TOGETHER TO FORM THE CASING. PRICK THE TOP PASTRY LIGHTLY WITH A FORK THE SAME WAY THAT IS DONE WHEN MAKING SHORTBREAD. BEAT ONE EGG AND BRUSH EGG OVER TOP OF PASTRY AND CHILL IN REFRIGERATOR FOR ONE HOUR BEFORE BAKING. BAKE AT 450 DEGREES FOR 15 MINUTES; THEN, REDUCE HEAT TO 375 DEGREES AND CONTINUE BAKING FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES (CHECK AFTER 20 MINUTES). SPRINKLE TOP WITH POWDERED SUGAR. Enjoy! David Scott from Johnstown, PA, USA After reading the Fly Cemetery recipe again, I that it needed some clarification Two things in particular: 1. Divide the kneaded do into halves (1/2s) NOT thirds. I don’t remember if I transcribed this incorrectly from the hand written letter I( received. 2. Do not use the egg in the current (or raisin) mixture; or in the dough, itself. Use the egg as a wash over the top of the top layer of rolled dough covering the currents (or raisins) that are on top of the bottom layer of rolled dough. I hope that this makes the above recipe make more sense. David Scott from Johnstown, PA I'm delighted to find this page! My grandmother (born a MacNair in Virginia in 1897) used to give us flat, raisin-filled pastries she called ""bug cakes"". I've looked for them often since, but never found anything like them. I think you've solved the mystery! Mary Llewellyn from Los Angeles, CA, USA My grandma used to call this fly trap cake. She never wrote the recipe down and made it all from memory after she passed away know one knew how to make it. Thank you. You have just made my day. Karen from Canada How exciting to find others who know about fly's cemetery. My mum who grew up in Glasgow used to make it for my sisters and I when we were young. She passed away and the recipe had never been written down. Thank you all! Janet from South Carolina I gew up in the Monterey area of California. My grandmother was from Glasgow, and made us fly cemeteries -- as a 9 year old, I could trade fly cemeteries for almost anything at lunch -- the children's gross factor, I suppose. Anyway, I've had my grandmother's recipe for years, but many of the terms in it meant nothing to me. Thank you. Judith from Oregon These cakes are know as Gurr Cakes in Dublin (possibly from a bastardised version of Norman French ""Guerre"") Denise Courtney from Dublin, Republic of Ireland BEST DAYS AT SCHOOL DINNERS IN GLASGOW WERE THE DAYS OF FLY CEMETERY AND CUSTARD EDGAR from FLORIDA I was delighted to find the receipe for Fly's Graveyard. I made this for my boys when they were small and now can make this for my grandchildren. Thank you so much Patricia Aylen from Hamilton, Ontario Canada

"Letter from America by Alistair Cooke, New Year's Resolutions",transcript,,None,"And warm good wishes for a Happy New Year wherever you are or - quickly remembering my political correctness - perhaps I should say wherever 1st January is the beginning of your New Year.

Every New Year's Eve there's a scene in New York's Times Square that's been going on for ever and one that's now watched by Americans across the country who are respectively an hour behind New York or two hours, on the coast three hours. Here I've dug out a description of the scene a year or two ago, which describes not only New York's famous ball of light, but records what used to be a compulsory chore for journalists, a sampling of the commonest New Year's resolutions. Here it is.

""The clocks struck the hour and the great ball of 450 incandescent bulbs glowed and then fell from the mast head of the Times building in New York City. Not long after first light tomorrow regiments of women would be out invading the January sales rustling among tidal waves of silk crpe de Chine, picking up bargains in Albatross boudoir jackets and non-bargains in French silk stockings. All across the country, men would renew the usual annual resolutions to stay away from the pool room, to learn hypnotism, to buy a Madelette, no plates, no films, no fuss, picture taken and finished on the spot in less than a minute, to abandon what they call the drink habit, to learn shorthand in 30 days, to buy a wireless practise set in order to learn the Morse code, to invest in a John Deere plough, to take one of those correspondence school courses and earn more money. I tell you what's holding you down, Jim, best of all the most widespread of all American resolutions of the time to get fat, which is what all the advertisements promised, let us make you fat. At our own risk we offer to put 10, 15, yes 30 pounds of good solid stay-there flesh on your bones.""

Well, you must have already been brought up short by the all American resolutions of the time, of what time? Of New Year's Day 1915 - that's what I was describing. Of all those quaint resolutions I think there's probably only one that still stands, the admirable sad determination probably due to fail to give up the drink habit. I discovered, by the way, that by the end of this year, it will have been just 60 years since two American men, drinking buddies, took a pledge to shake the habit; the important thing about their pledge was that they took it together and had a new idea about how to keep it. If either of them as the weeks and months of their abstinence went along, if either of them felt himself slipping or aching for a drink, he was call to the other who promised to arrive at once like a nurse and see his pal through, as they say, through it the throes of temptation.

The man who had this idea was known until he died as Bill W. He hoped to recruit others, many others into this routine and he promised to do it on the understanding that their identity would never be published, they would be anonymous that was the beginning in 1935 of Alcoholics Anonymous.

Now at that time in this country, I remember in New Haven, Connecticut, Yale University had a pioneering department of so-called alcoholic studies; it was run by a psychiatrist and both before and after it was the educated consensus that an alcoholic's best hope of cure was through psychiatric treatment. I suppose Europe too had its clinics, it certainly shared the general presumption about the value of psychiatry. I knew the man who was in charge at Yale and after a few years he confessed that while their studies could detail symptoms and the clinical course of the disease and could elaborate theories about causes, well he was an honest man and admitted they were producing no cures. Soon afterwards, he shut up shop.

Of course, all the psychiatrists had heard of Alcoholics Anonymous and its methods and it's fair to say that at that time among most double-domed psychiatrists AA was derided as a rather maudlin method, a sentimental routine. Bill W at once admitted as much, he nailed the psychiatrists, the Freudians especially on their own ground with their favourite doctrine, that most deep human impulses are childlike and that chronic drunkenness has much to do with the protest against a lack of affection. Well, said Bill W, we make it up to them, we give it to them at the moment they most need it.

Very soon, I should say by the 1950s, psychiatrists no longer claimed to be able to cure alcoholism and grudgingly admitted that AA worked as it does and has gone on doing. There was at the time, one famous intellectual who might, you might have guessed would be certain to back the psychiatrists and despise AA as rather vulgar stuff but, no, he saw it working from the start on good friends and when Bill W died and his identity was revealed as William ""Bill"" Wilson all of us actually called him the greatest social architect of our time.

Among all the other resolutions, I don't suppose anybody today is vowing to learn shorthand in 30 days or 30 years or learn the Morse code but the one resolution I'm positive no American swore to in the waning hours of 1993 was the last one I noted, ""we promise we can make you fat with good stay-there flesh on your bones"". Heavens to Betsy.

When I came on that 1915 advertisement, I turned the page and faced an accompanying illustration. I'm looking at it now, it shows a handsome muscular man sitting tailor fashion on the beach beside what was then called a deep bosomed fine figure of a woman, say 160 pounds, 11-12 stone, they were both wearing what were known as bathing costumes. She's looking over to him and pointing to two skeletons up the beach. Today, they'd look normal enough and she's saying ""gee look at that pair of skinny scarecrows, why don't they try and then the brand name of the stuff that came in box costing 50¢, first box free, if you didn't gain 10 pounds in the first week or two, money back"". Don't you wonder what it could possibly be? All it says in the fine print blurb is that this treatment increases the red corpuscles in the blood, strengthens the nerves and puts the digestive tract into such shape that food is assimilated, imagine and turned into good solid healthy flesh.

Today, the ad would more likely echo Hamlet and show you how this too too solid flesh could be made to melt. That ad and that dieting mania was published as I say in 1915. Ten years later, certainly by the mid '20s, the ideal female figure in Britain as well as America had changed dramatically. I never know who dictates these things, I suppose the fashion designers in order to stay solvent have to change the ideal shape drastically at regular intervals so that you can't just take in a tuck or two, you have to buy completely new clothes.

Well, by 1925, it was decreed that the deep bosomed woman should not only loose her depth, she should have no bosom at all and take off at the very least those 30 pounds her mother had put on. And so in that curious absolutely dependable way that life imitates art everywhere suddenly young women of all classes except the very poor and the very old and rich had flat chests, short skirts above legs without calves, bobbed hair and were in 10 years more radically different looking from their mothers than any two generations have been since.

Shortly after the First War was over, a word came into the language and a dieting practice that swept Britain. The practice but not the word did the same in the United States, it was Banting. I used to think this probably derived from the Canadian doctor Frederick Banting who discovered co-discovered insulin, but no. Mr Banting was a London cabinet maker who came to fame rather late in life. By the 1920s he was crowding 60, he had a theory how to take off that stay there fat, how in fact to slim, avoid all fats, starches and sugar hence ""to bant"" became the fashion first with society women and very soon with all women and ever since dieting has meant taking flesh off not putting it on to stay there.

There was a report, however, a so-called survey came out last weekend announcing a new trend called pleasure revenge, a fad for defying all the good rules we've learned through the years about cigarettes, caffeine, fatty foods. This defiance takes the form of choosing high-fat snacks, of putting on a couple of pounds instead of losing 10. And who conducted this survey? A marketing vice president and a professor of psychology whose specialty is studying New Year's resolutions. He finds that neither losing weight nor stopping smoking was the number one resolution among, he says, a lot of people; he doesn't say how many over how many years they were studied. In fact, the last thing that's indicated by this so-called survey is a scientific study; the professor calls the movement a backlash against the last decade's relentless beating of the health drum. Don't believe it. It says here, quote, ""representatives of the dairy, beef, pork, sugar, snack food, fast food and tobacco industries view the recent survey with enthusiasm"". You can believe that.

My Brother has been an alcoholic for over 15 years now, coupled with scar tissue from a head injury which is inoperable and cannot be treated but would be manageable without the presence of alcohol. In our opinion he is not safe nor capable of living on his own and carrying out normal daily tasks. He suffers from siezures and we often find him in hospital. He has been admitted to a psychiatic ward for his alcohol abuse, dried out and sent home. He wasnt offered any rehabilitation afterwards because there was no room for him. It has long been our opinion that Mark has been cheated of the chance to beat his addiction because no after care is ever given. Try telling an alcoholic to go home after 10 days in a clinic and don't do it again. How is it that other people get onto programmes such as James Kingham but Mark has been overlooked for years now. We are all trudging a very long emotional road which has, in particular, made my Mother very sick. Mark has on several occassions been ready to quit but hasn't been given the support he so desperately deserves and needs. SEE ALSO

'Why I drink 100 units of alcohol a week',Heavy drinkers share their boozing habits - including spending £500 a month on wine.,,2018-08-21T16:26:29+00:00,"Image copyright Getty Images

How much alcohol do you drink?

People have been sharing their drinking habits after presenter Adrian Chiles revealed he sometimes drank more than 100 units a week - more than seven times the recommended limit.

He said drinking never affects his life and he considers himself a social drinker, not an alcoholic.

Other heavy drinkers have been speaking about their alcohol consumption.

'Do I want to stop? No'

Paul Tomlinson, 48, from Thornton-Cleveleys in Lancashire says it is ""easy to rack up drinking when you're sat at home"".

""I regularly drink 80 to 100 units a week, most of it between Friday and Sunday.

""On each night I will usually have two or three beers - sometimes alcohol free now actually - followed by a bottle of wine and then two or three large gin and tonics.

""This is roughly 16 to 18 units a night for three consecutive nights. I will then do at least two or three more bottles of wine in the week with a couple of gin and tonics again.

Image copyright Paul Tomlinson Image caption Paul Tomlinson says society primes people to drink alcohol

""Do I consider myself an alcoholic? No! Do I want to stop drinking at the level I do? Not really.

""I have a disabled son who is 24 so don't go out often and as a result drink more at home.

""I don't go to bed feeling outrageously drunk and I don't black out on the sofa.""

'£500 a month on wine'

One man, who chose to remain anonymous, says his father was an ""old fashioned"" alcoholic who started drinking in the morning - but that he is not an alcoholic.

""I find myself in the habit of putting away one and a half to two bottles of white wine every night, unless I'm really thirsty in which case it might be two and a half bottles.

""I start at 6 or 7pm, couple of glasses whilst preparing family supper, continue through PS4 ""wind down"" time, another couple of glasses.

""Then usually finish off the second bottle whilst listening to music. Tada! £500 a month on wine.

""I'm in a strange position, as I can (and do) stop when I want to - sometimes for a month or two just to prove to myself I'm not an alcoholic like my dad.

""I'll go out with my mates and not touch a drop, again - just to prove a point to myself. And yet I still drink far, far too much.

Image copyright Getty Images

""I'm rarely drunk nowadays, although obviously I still don't drive. I just wish someone would make a drink that tastes as nice as wine, without the alcohol.

""I'm currently losing weight and so have ""limited"" myself to a half to one bottle of wine a night.

""I find that the problem is the habit more than alcohol. I smoked 20 plus a day for 20 years then quit five years ago, with no patches etc.

""Never felt like a relapse, never been tempted to have 'just one'. I think alcohol is in the same category.

""Although, as I can testify with my father, the drug is insidious and rather than just kill your body, if you let it, it will kill your personality first.""

'I'm all or nothing'

Adrian Chiles' account of his alcohol consumption ""mirrors almost exactly"" how Mark Baker, 58, from North Somerset, says he drinks.

""Like him I drink about 80 to 100 units a week and have done so for many years.

""I have a slight fatty liver (as does he) but otherwise perfectly OK. I have never suffered from depression or anxiety.

""I drink mostly out of habit. I never get drunk, drink and drive, I never drink in the mornings or at lunchtime, I just like a drink in the evening to wind down and relax.

""I am an export manager so drinking is part of the territory.

Image copyright Getty Images

""Last year in October I stopped drinking for a month. I was worried that I was dependent on it.

""I found it easy to do especially as there are so many products on the market with low or no alcohol. I could still have a beer, glass of wine or even a gin and tonic. Yes, there is low alcohol spirit.

""Like Adrian, I will probably give up drinking rather than rationing it as when I have tried that in the past it never seems to work. I am definitely an all or nothing person.""

'I will try and cut down'

Annemarie McAleese, 48, from Belfast, owns her own restaurant and says she starts drinking wine when she gets home as she ""potters about"".

""On average I would drink two bottles of white wine each night, and have done for the last seven years.

""I have my own business, and work in it five or six days per week.

""After reading this article, I think now is the time to rethink my drinking habits.

""It's a very bad habit. I think I will try to cut down. I think I use owning my business as an excuse because it can be quite stressful.

""I won't watch the programme with my husband because I don't need somebody yapping in my ear 'you need to stop', I need to do this for myself.""

'High functioning alcoholic'

John, from Essex, says he considered himself a ""moderate social drinker"" until he developed liver disease.

""Then I gave up drinking altogether but the liver disease worsened leading to many hospital visits and the need for a liver transplant.

""I had never missed work or put drink ahead of all else but when I detailed out my daily drinking to numerous doctors over a nine-month period I was embarrassed to realise that I was effectively a high-functioning alcoholic.

""I am pleased to say that thanks to my organ donor I have led a healthy, happy life for the last eight years and become a grandfather three times.

""Something I would have missed if I had carried on as before.

Image caption Presenter Adrian Chiles speaks about alcohol after revealing he sometimes drank 100 units a week.

""If Adrian's show makes anyone seriously look at the amount they drink and reduce it then he is doing a great job.

""On the subject of giving up alcohol I feel sometimes too much is made of how difficult this is, rather than concentrating on the benefits of being sober.

""Better health, better sleep, no hangovers, higher alertness and an ability to enjoy things with a clear head.""

Alcohol and health

The number of adults who say they drink alcohol is at its lowest level since surveys began in 2005, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

The NHS recommends not drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week. If you do drink that much, it is best to spread it over three or more days.

One unit of alcohol is 10ml of pure alcohol, which is equivalent to half a pint of normal-strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits.

A small glass of wine contains about 1.5 units, a standard glass is 2.1 and a bottle of wine contains 10 units.

Meanwhile, a can of lager, beer or cider is two units. A pint is two or three units, depending on whether it is lower or higher strength.

According to the NHS, someone may need help if:","['drink', 'alcohol', 'dont', 'wine', 'think', 'units', 'drinking', 'stop', 'week', 'need', '100']","""I regularly drink 80 to 100 units a week, most of it between Friday and Sunday.

Alcoholics are being paid in beer to clean the streets of Amsterdam as part of a project partly funded by the Dutch government - the organisers think other countries should abandon ""old-fashioned political correctness"" and adopt the same approach.

Rene scours the streets, grasping at discarded wrappers.

His movements are fuelled by a tangible pride. It is an unfamiliar emotion for a man whose alcohol addiction has cost him so much.

""I have four children and three ex-wives, but alcohol has finished everything. I don't see them, they don't know where I am, or if I am alive. Now I have only him. He is there for 30 years, when times are good and bad, he is always there,"" he says, referring to his habit.

His affectionate gaze travels downwards. It rests on an aluminium can.

Chronic alcoholics have congregated inside a communal space, commandeered by the Rainbow Group. It is a private but primarily government-funded company, which helps those struggling to cope due to homelessness, drug abuse or alcoholism.

A gas heater emanates warmth; someone hums along to the theme tune from Armageddon.

Rene, 52, has just cracked open his third can of the day. It has just gone 11:30 in the morning.

Image caption Rene has four children and three ex-wives but now he is devoted to alcohol

He is one of 20 alcoholics who have joined this initiative. They arrive at 09:00 and work until 15:00. They take extended breaks for beer, cigarettes and a hot lunch, all provided free of charge.

The distinctive aroma of stamppot, a traditional Dutch vegetable stew, wafts through from the kitchen.

The air is hazy with smoke and camaraderie; another pop anthem fills the room with nostalgia.

""They like to cook and you see qualities they didn't even know they had,"" says Janet van de Noord, who runs the Rainbow Group's litter project.

'Cost-effective'

""It's quite difficult to get these people off the alcohol completely. We have tried everything else. Now this is the only thing that works. We might not make them better, but we are giving them a better quality of life and it's better for the neighbourhood, they're giving something back to society.""

Inside an oversized garden shed, decorated with Ajax football paraphernalia, about 6,000 cans of beer are stacked in crates.

The Rainbow Group is reluctant to say exactly how much the Dutch government pays towards the free beer, cautious of generating any negative publicity that might jeopardise their funding.

But Ms van de Noord argues it is a cost-effective way to tackle the impact of alcoholism. ""If people are being arrested, it also costs society a lot of money. So this can only be a good thing. I don't see why other countries wouldn't want to do it.""

When I asked other Dutch people about the project they all spoke in favour of it.

Ten minutes' walk from the now litter-free streets lies Amsterdam's Oosterpark.

Image caption Oosterpark is no longer strewn with litter but some alcoholics have not been persuaded to give up their park benches

Fountains propel shimmering bursts of water; leaves create an autumnal collage on the path.

This slice of Dutch life is interrupted by a man staggering towards us. ""Mooooi!"" (""beautiful"") he says, greeting us with a sleazy smile. But he quickly makes it clear that he and his friends do not wish to be interviewed.

He is one of the remaining alcoholics who have not been persuaded to abandon their park benches.

Since the street-cleaning programme started 12 months ago, local police have received fewer reports of stabbings and muggings in the park. And all of the residents we spoke to said they were happy with the government supporting this unconventional approach.

Instead of being ostracised by society, the alcoholics' needs appear to have been incorporated into the Dutch healthcare system.

The Rainbow Group is optimistic their success so far will attract more funding and help them to reach the unreachable. Other cities in the Netherlands are now considering introducing similar schemes.

Floor van Bakkum of Amsterdam's Jellinek anti-addiction clinic says the project is a good way to deal with ""a very problematic group - it's kind of harm reduction"". She likened it to giving carefully monitored methadone or heroin doses to chronic heroin addicts.

""It might help them to do something else with their life. You always have to monitor such a project, so it shouldn't attract new alcoholics - it's not an open invitation to drink in Oosterpark."" She said such a scheme would be inappropriate for alcoholics who still live at home and have a job.

'Unchangeable reality'

Back on litter duty, Rene tells me about his past life - expensive cars, extensive travel and some details best not shared. But, he insists, he is happier now, with nothing.

He detects our incredulity: ""You don't believe me? Trust me, if I could have my life again I would give it all up for this.

""I know he will never expect anything from me or let me down. Now I am free,"" he says, referring to the drink habit.

Some might wonder, how free can an addict be?

But the founders of this project treat this addiction as an ""unchangeable reality"" and tackle it using the only device that is guaranteed to connect with the patients.

""I come for the beer. If there was no beer then why would I come?"" says Rene.

Regardless of their motivations, Rene and his friends are making a positive difference in a community where they were once despised.

""It's true,"" Rene concedes, acknowledging the irony. ""They used to treat us like garbage - and now we are picking up their garbage, we are not the garbage anymore.""","['litter', 'rainbow', 'paid', 'life', 'amsterdam', 'rene', 'group', 'project', 'alcoholics', 'dutch', 'beer', 'streets', 'collecting']","Chronic alcoholics have congregated inside a communal space, commandeered by the Rainbow Group.

How my famous jockey dad died from 'alcoholism',Natasha Eddery-Dunsdon says she knew deep down all her life that her dad liked to drink.,,None,"Natasha Eddery-Dunsdon says she knew deep down all her life that her dad liked to drink.

But, it wasn't until she was a teenager that she realised how bad it was and that ultimately, he'd choose alcohol over his family.

""He loved all of us and I know that. I really do believe that he wanted to get better,"" she told Newsbeat.

""But there was nothing he could really do in the end and it did control him.""

Her dad, Pat Eddery, was an 11-time champion jockey. He died on Tuesday at the age of 63.

""Filled with grief that my dad is no longer here,"" wrote Natasha in an Instagram post at the time.

Speaking to Newsbeat, the 30-year-old reveals how she and her older sister Nicola knew that, even though their dad was trying to get help, the disease had a grip on him.

In 2010 her dad went into rehab for the second time but it didn't work out.

I can't be a part of your life if you're going to choose drink over having your family in your life Natasha

""He was in a rehab facilitation in Ireland and I actually knew two weeks before he came out that he was going to drink again,"" she says.

""I picked him up and he did drink in the airport. I knew that was his choice then, he was going to drink.""

On the surface, her dad was a hugely successful sportsman and the life and soul of any party.

But he was, she says, also a functioning alcoholic.

In the end, Natasha didn't see her dad for several years because she found it too painful.

""As I walked out the house I said 'I can't be a part of your life if you're going to choose drink over having your family in your life,'"" she says.

""I'd been through so much and that was the last straw. He had to make it on his own now and that was his decision.""

Nobody should ever feel ashamed of seeking help Natasha

Natasha was in her final year at university when things got worse for her and her family.

""He was drinking at strange hours and it was becoming more and more apparent that he had a problem,"" she explains.

""I was getting worried about whether I was going to be able to finish uni. Dad was in such a bad way and I didn't know what I was going to do.""

She turned to her university who helped her find a counsellor.

""Nobody should ever feel ashamed of seeking help,"" she says.

Natasha's counsellor became a big part of her life and she says she suddenly felt like she had a big support network.

Deep down he would have loved to have stayed healthy and kept his family Natasha

Natasha wants others who are affected by alcoholism in their family, especially younger people, to seek help.

""There are things like Al-Anon and you can go to meetings for children of alcoholics or parents and brothers and sisters of alcoholics,"" she says.

""Some people might find that uncomfortable but there are people out there to help.""

Natasha also wants to raise awareness of what she describes as a ""horrible disease"".

""The only reason I'm able to talk about this really is because dad was such an amazing man and people respect him and adore him,"" she says.

""I think deep down he would have loved to have stayed healthy and kept his family.

""If there are people out there who are struggling, don't be ashamed or feel any guilt about getting help.

""It's a wonderful thing if you can reach out and ask for it,"" she urges.

Every university 'needs' Alcoholics Anonymous meetings,Alcoholics Anonymous says the number of younger people attending their meetings is on the increase.,,None,"Image copyright Getty Images

Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings should take place in universities across the UK, student leaders have said.

Charity AA says the number of younger people attending their meetings is on the increase.

NUS Wales president Gwyneth Sweatman said Cardiff University's sessions for problem drinkers, one of the first of its kind, have made a big difference.

One student said the help she received turned her life around.

Cardiff undergraduate ""Marie"" said alcohol pushed her life at university to the edge.

At her lowest ebb, she drank 15 pints of cider a day, was arrested and risked being kicked off her course.

She said: ""It was affecting my work significantly.

""I wasn't concentrating in meetings, I couldn't focus, I was erratic in my behaviour and my decisions.""

""I wasn't turning up, it was having a really negative effect on my mental health and that was spiralling, really awful anxiety and depression and suicide-based thoughts.""

The latest official data suggest young people are drinking less.

However, Dr Mani Mehdikhani, a trustee at Alcoholics Anonymous, said the number of younger attendees at meetings was on the up.

""Looking at our own internal AA surveys that we conduct every five years, every time a survey is undertaken we have increasingly larger numbers of younger people coming as new-comers to AA.

""The last survey in 2015, about 33% of our newcomers were under 40 and I'm sure a big percentage were in the university student-age group.""

Image caption The weekly AA meeting at Cardiff University's student union is for anyone who wants to stop drinking.

Cardiff University also has a student counselling and a well-being team which provides support for ""some of the underlying difficulties associated with, or directly linked to, alcohol misuse"".

Jennifer Kent, a vice president at the union, said: ""For us it feels like a really good way of integrating the students and the community here, and it's also important that, by bringing it here, the students don't feel stigmatised.""

NUS Wales president, Gwyneth Sweatman said she thought the AA meetings idea was ""absolutely brilliant"", and one which she would ""love"" to see replicated across the UK - similar to the United States, where college campaigns AA meetings are more common.","['aa', 'meetings', 'student', 'wasnt', 'really', 'president', 'university', 'wales', 'alcoholics', 'universitys', 'needs', 'younger', 'anonymous']","Image copyright Getty ImagesAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings should take place in universities across the UK, student leaders have said.

What happens in an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting?,"Members of Alcoholics Anonymous are marking its 75th anniversary, but what really goes on inside the group's meetings?",,None,"Image caption The true nature of alcoholism is a controversial subject

Members of Alcoholics Anonymous are marking its 75th anniversary, but what really goes on inside the group's meetings?

David looks, in a word, respectable.

Bespectacled, and in a polo shirt and khaki shorts, he could be any respectable middle-aged man.

He sits in a circle of other respectable-looking people in a church hall in a well-to-do part of Washington. Without knowing the context, as he prepares to speak, one might guess that this was a heritage group, ready to save a historic warehouse, or a meeting of concerned residents, demanding traffic-calming measures.

Instead, when David opens his mouth, he starts to talk about his first use of drugs at the age of 12.

Later he talks about his conscious decision to drink himself to death.

Easy eloquence

There is the revelation of small-time drug smuggling trips to South America and a life of profound lows.

But he has an easy eloquence.

""I have fond memories of the moronic quality of being drunk,"" he says.

People do feel shame and guilt when they do things that are bad - in AA you learn to be shameless and guiltless Jack Trimpey , Rational Recovery

""My story is getting far away mentally. It is almost like the Peloponnesian War now.""

The others in the group also speak enthusiastically, talking of trials and tribulations, of their relationship to drink and how they came to be part of AA.

One gum-chewing, room-dominating woman contrasts life as a high-powered sober Washingtonian with her previous pre-AA life in a series of expansive arm gestures. Another man quietly and movingly recounts his son's troubles with the law.

It's impossible to say whether these individuals were always raconteurs or whether their storytelling matured as they took the 12 Steps.

'Higher power'

Certain lines provoke laughter in the group.

""The only thing I knew for sure about my problem was it wasn't a drinking problem,"" deadpans one man. ""I knew you had to drink too much to have a drinking problem and I could never drink enough.""

Image caption The AA dates its foundation to its co-founder's last drink

There are other phrases that are reverentially repeated. Life became ""unmanageable"" and a ""higher power"" has been at work.

A 70-year-old salesman talks about a life where money was made in computers but years were lost to vodka.

A woman talks of her travels and a reassuring fact. ""There are rooms like this all over the world where crazy people get to talk.""

Of the 11 men and three women in the room, eight have been sober for more than 20 years.

And their meeting is in a long tradition that stretches back to 10 June 1935, to the day Robert Smith - better known as Dr Bob - had his last drink. He had been working with AA co-founder Bill Wilson, now usually referred to as Bill W.

Fictional depictions

The organisation they created has helped millions give up drinking and rebuild their lives.

And the meetings, with the 12-Step Programme that is at the heart of AA, are familiar even to those who have had nothing to do with the group.

The higher power is not just the god of your understanding it is the people in the room Stan, Recovering alcoholic

Countless depictions on film and television have familiarised people with what goes on at the meetings and the familiar formulation ""I'm X and I'm an alcoholic"".

The organisation has its critics. There are those who disagree with the founding idea that alcoholism is a disease, a compulsion that the individual can do nothing about.

Others dislike the Christian nature of the group. The 12 Steps talk of God ""as you understood him"".

Jack Trimpey, who runs his own programme Rational Recovery, is a trenchant critic.

""We do object that it is a bad religion, one in which people profess powerlessness against their bodily desires. We are not powerless. We have a moral duty to cease and desist once it is shown.

""It has been a massive inversion of public thinking that has entered the mainstream media.

""People do feel shame and guilt when they do things that are bad. In AA you learn to be shameless and guiltless.""

He prefers to call himself a former ""bad drunk"" and speaks of an alternative approach that calls for ""zero tolerance in the family"".

Having been sober for many year, he dislikes the typical AA attitude towards that.

""It's not an accomplishment - common decency is no accomplishment.""

Image caption Concerns about binge drinking are now common to much of the world

But for the people at the AA meetings, common decency - and everything else good in life - is an accomplishment.

Jonathan speaks of the single day in 1987 when he first had a moment of happiness. And he knows how it must be maintained.

""I pray and I meditate, and I couple that with working with other alcoholics.""

People at the group seem to have no problem with the varied application of the religious element of AA. There are atheist and agnostic groups, but it's hard to get away from the references to God in the 12 Steps that are at the heart of AA.

The softly-spoken Stan explains: ""The higher power is not just the god of your understanding, it is the people in the room.""

And those other people are the key, one woman admits.

""It works because everything I attempted to do about drinking by myself never worked.

""By coming into AA I was able to get support to not drink - people who think exactly like me, that common bond.""

Alcoholics Anonymous was founded 80 years ago. It has spawned a host of other groups dealing with every manner of compulsion, writes Chris Stokel-Walker.

""My name is Peter and I'm an alcoholic.""

It's a familiar phrase even to those who have never attended a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous. When Peter introduces himself to 40 others in a small room just off Newcastle's main shopping thoroughfare, on a sunny Saturday morning, he receives a warm welcome back in unison.

Everyone here shares a drink dependency, though they come from hugely different walks of life. The format of the meeting is simple - an introduction, a reading, one member explaining their story, then a free-for-all discussion for others to share their concerns, their triumphs, and their thoughts.

Peter began to drink at the age of 11. ""By the age of legal drinking in the UK I was being admitted to local alcoholic units; in and out of doctors; in and out of police cells. Everything in my life really deteriorated."" But Peter hasn't tasted alcohol in 34 years, and he attributes his sobriety to Alcoholics Anonymous.

All members talk about ""working through the 12 steps"" that form the cornerstone of the programme. The first of the steps, published four years after AA began, reads: ""We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable.""

The 12 steps outline a plan of recovery to overcome addiction, which involves submitting to a higher spiritual power and admitting that alcoholism is an ongoing problem. Founded by Bill Wilson and Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio, AA grew out of a Christian organisation - the Oxford Group.

Image copyright ALAMY Image caption The 12-step recovery programme for Narcotics Anonymous are the same for AA

The group is marking 80 years from the moment Wilson helped Smith - 10 June 1935 was the latter's last drink. That social element of AA, the importance of ""sponsors"" in the process, is as well known as any of the steps.

Today, there are 115,326 Alcoholics Anonymous groups in 175 different countries, according to the group's latest estimates, with more than two million members. There are 60,143 groups in the United States alone.

According to a study in 1998, 90% of private substance abuse treatment centres based in the US model their treatment on the 12 steps. The principles have provided a basis for other 12-steps groups with no affiliation to mainstream AA.

THE 12 STEPS

We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable

Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity

Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him

Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves

Admitted to God, to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs

Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character

Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings

Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all

Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others

Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it

Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out

Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs

These include Narcotics Anonymous, the more specific Marijuana Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Workaholics Anonymous and Sexaholics Anonymous.

Clutterers Anonymous deals with those with hoarding problems. Underearners Anonymous offers support for those suffering an ""inability to provide for one's needs"". Support for loved ones of those going through addiction is on offer at Families Anonymous.

On Monday alone there were four Narcotics Anonymous meetings in Manchester, a Marijuana Anonymous meeting in Fitzrovia, central London, and an Overeaters Anonymous session in Cannock. For some of the smaller groups, if there's no dedicated meeting available, addicts are advised to go to AA as a substitute.

Across England, Wales and Scotland, 687 different Alcoholics Anonymous meetings took place on Monday, with 113 chapters coming together in London alone.

""If you look at any 12-step programme, the only significant difference really is the first part of the first step,"" says Peter, who attends AA meetings and organises Emotions Anonymous meetings in the North East of England.

The latter group deals with issues as diverse as low self-esteem, resentment, fear, anger, indecision, perfectionism, forgiveness, depression, grief, shame and anxiety.

""I think there's a fellowship for every particular human condition,"" Peter jokes. ""But I can understand that, because apart from the first part of the first step, the rest of the programme is a programme for living.""

Image copyright Other Image caption AA meeting depicted in the House of Cards

Most fellowships offer Skype sessions, where you'll be greeted in the same way, any hour of the day by welcoming peers always happy to listen, and you'll say the same words: ""My name is… and I'm addicted to …""

""The 12 steps are very applicable to any other addiction,"" says Amy Krentzman of the University of Minnesota's School of Social Work, who has conducted research into Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programmes.

""They modify the language, but it's the same basic programme, the same basic steps, and other people have got well from following them.""

The ""helper"" theory, first coined in the 1960s, helps explain AA's efficacy, says Krentzman. The helper ends up feeling better too. Most, if not all, of those running 12-step groups are themselves undergoing treatment for addiction.

In countless movies and TV shows - from the Sopranos to Mad Men to House of Cards to the West Wing - the sponsor-addict relationship crops up. Sponsors act as a spiritual, emotional and practical guide.

Treatment is always ongoing in AA, unlike some other traditional rehabilitation programmes which offer short programmes followed by the addict coping largely alone.

Marijuana Anonymous has ""exactly the same format"", explains Thomas, a member. ""It has the 12 steps, and various stories that illustrate the practical application of those steps, and stories from people who have gone through the experience and gone sober.""

These spin-off groups are not explicitly endorsed by Alcoholics Anonymous World Services (AAWS), which oversees the organisation's copyrights. But AAWS does grant permission for groups to use the 12 steps.

And AA's principles are still regularly criticised. Some dislike the quasi-religious element, others the emphasis on complete abstinence rather than the possibility of moderate consumption. There's also a new film - The 13th Step - about sexual assaults carried out by AA members on other members.

But perhaps the greatest criticism is from those who want concrete evidence that this widely accepted programme actually produces results.

""The evidence is that it works very well for some people,"" says Krentzman. A review of scientific studies of Alcoholics Anonymous' success in aiding sobriety in 2006 found that ""no experimental studies unequivocally demonstrated the effectiveness of AA"".

Dr Lance Dodes, a former substance abuse treatment specialist, wrote in a book about 12-step programmes that: ""Alcoholics Anonymous was proclaimed the correct treatment for alcoholism over 75 years ago despite the absence of any scientific evidence of the approach's efficacy, and we have been on the wrong path ever since.""

Another bone of contention is that porting across the 12-step programme to other areas offers cultural legitimacy to the idea of a wide range of compulsions as addictive diseases.

Scientists continue to be divided over whether food addiction really exists. They are torn as to whether sex addiction is real or not. It does not, for example, appear in the American Psychiatric Association's list of mental disorders.

But for many, the programme is effective. Krentzman notes: ""It works because of a psychological process, a social process, a spiritual process. Because of the way it gives people a sense of community and knowing other people who have the same problem.""

That's something Jennifer, who attends Overeaters Anonymous, agrees with. She joined the group in 2008, when she was 37 years old and 17-and-a-half stone. Today, she is at a more manageable weight, and attributes that to her ongoing relationship with the fellowship of overeaters.

""When I'd been to therapists and they were telling me to try things, they had no experience of it themselves,"" she says. ""There's something about one addict helping another addict. There was an authenticity to what they were saying.""

""It's a very simple programme for complicated people,"" Thomas says, ""and it seems to withstand a lot of questioning from outside and within, which can't be said for a lot of rehab philosophies.""

In the AA meeting in Newcastle, 40 people sit and share stories of addiction. Aftewards, there are firm handshakes and friendly conversations - smiles and shared jokes.

One by one, they file out the door into the crowds toting shopping bags, looking like anyone else. But in their mind, they carry an extra weight with them throughout the week.

Alcohol dependency: When social drinking becomes a problem,"Alcohol-related health issues among baby boomers are on the rise. Daily drinking can start off as a social event, but turn into dependency and addiction, experts say.",,None,"Alcohol-related health issues among baby boomers are on the rise. Daily drinking can start off as a social event but turn into dependency, addiction experts say. So when does social drinking become alcoholism?

In the festive season, with office parties, Christmas, and new year, there is opportunity aplenty for yet another tipple.

Since the 1950s, alcohol consumption in the UK has gradually increased. The NHS now spends more on alcohol-related illness among baby boomers than any other age group, with £825m spent on 55 to 74-year-olds in 2010-11 compared to £64m on under-24s.

Alcohol addiction When someone becomes dependent or addicted to alcohol, they: Develop a strong sense of compulsion to drink

May drink shortly after waking to reduce feelings of alcohol withdrawal

Develop a reduced capacity to control how often and how much they drink

Organise their lifestyle around drinking

Continue to drink despite physical or social problems Source: BBC Health The long-term effects of alcohol

Estimates also suggest about nine per cent of men and three per cent of women in the UK show signs of alcohol dependence.

But it is the functioning alcoholic that can slip under the radar - before their health issues are severe enough to need treatment.

Straight vodka

Dr John Marsden, an alcohol and drug dependency expert from King's College London, says a typical functioning alcoholic can manage to hold down a job despite having a ""very severe drinking problem that they have been incubating over a very long period"".

""Alcohol problems are difficult to understand because they do not occur overnight. They are hidden from view which makes functioning alcoholics a group we cannot easily help.""

Rob C, who is 61, was one of them. At his worst he was drinking 1.5 litres of straight vodka per day.

""Then I began to suffer blackouts, losing whole days and not remembering anything.""

He would be first to arrive at work, which made him able to set out his ""drinks for the day with what looked like a bottle of mineral water"".

""I would hide bottles around the office. You think nobody else knows, that it doesn't smell, that you're getting away with it. But of course they did notice.""

Life saver

For several years, maintaining a full-time finance job, he drank increasingly more during the day.

There was work, there was money and increasingly the motivation to alter ones mood quickly. Alcohol has been the drug of choice to do that Dr John Marsden, Addiction expert

What started as a social pastime nearly cost him his relationship. Now sober for eight years, looking back he says that even if a colleague had said something at the time, he would not have listened.

""I resented the changes at work and told myself I deserved a drink. I would buy wine at lunchtime and drink it from a polystyrene cup.""

Wine turned to vodka for a ""bigger kick"" and lunchtime turned to morning through to night.

Early retirement on medical grounds made his addiction worse. It was only when his partner threatened to kick him out that he sought help with Alcoholics Anonymous, who he says saved his life.

Rob is not alone. In the last decade there has been a 63% increase in prescriptions for the treatment of alcohol dependency in England, as well as a 20% rise in deaths from liver disease.

Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, a liver specialist and chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance, believes the number of people dying from liver disease will keep rising.

The majority of people who have alcohol-related health problems are middle-aged, which Sir Ian says is a consequence of chronic alcohol misuse - many years of frequent heavy drinking, rather than binge drinking - a session of drinking large amounts of alcohol in a small space of time.

But he says that though there is a big overlap, it is important to remember not all heavy social drinkers are dependent on alcohol.

""Some people can control their drinking after work, others can't. If people are frequently drinking harmful levels of alcohol - over 50 units a week for men, 35 for women - most will end up suffering some form of physical, mental or social harm.""

A lifetime's worth of drinking is catching up with baby boomers, says Emily Robinson from the Alcohol Concern.

The charity hopes that their campaign, Dry January, will help get people thinking about how much they drink, especially at home when units are harder to measure, and crucially, before they reach a stage where drinking is affecting their health.

""The issue of people drinking every day is worrying as it's a way of slipping into dependency, as you need to drink a little more each time to feel the same effects,"" she says.

Dr Marsden suggests the line between social drinking and dependency is clear. He says the first question that needs to be asked by clinicians or family members is: ""Has anyone expressed concern to you about your drinking?""

What's a unit? Half a pint of standard strength (4%) beer, cider or lager

A single pub measure of spirit (25ml)

Half a standard glass of wine (175ml) Alcohol units guide

This question assesses whether a person's behaviour has negatively impacted on someone close to them, he adds.

""If your alcohol consumption has caused a problem for someone else - I'm not rushing to label you an alcoholic but suggesting you need to take a closer look at your behaviour.""

There is a clear reason the baby boomer generation is now most at risk from alcohol-related problems, argues Dr Marsden.

A hard-working generation led to an appetite for entertainment and relaxation.

""There was work, there was money and increasingly the motivation to alter one's mood quickly. Alcohol has been the drug of choice to do that.""","['alcoholrelated', 'drink', 'alcohol', 'problems', 'health', 'baby', 'dependency', 'work', 'social', 'drinking', 'problem']","Daily drinking can start off as a social event but turn into dependency, addiction experts say.

The unspoken alcohol problem among UK Punjabis,Alcohol consumption is glamorised across different aspects of Punjabi culture and shame stops many seeking the help that they need.,,None,"Image copyright Vik Kainth

For many British Punjabis, alcohol abuse is an open secret. Alcohol consumption is glamorised across different aspects of Punjabi culture and shame stops many seeking the help that they need.

Harjinder read her daughter Jaspreet one last bedtime story, then kissed her goodnight. She was exhausted after a long day, and drifted off next to her daughter. Her toddler son was already asleep in the next room.

The next thing she remembers is her husband yelling. He was drunk and furious that when he returned from the pub she wasn't in their marital bed. In a rage, he flipped the child's bed throwing his wife and daughter to the floor. Harjinder hit the radiator hard with Jaspreet landing on top of her.

Incidents like this were a regular feature of Jaspreet and her brother Hardeep's childhood. ""It was heartbreaking,"" Jaspreet says.

So when Harjinder found Hardeep, now aged 16, drinking whisky in his room after an argument with his alcoholic dad, she was terrified that he was following in his father's footsteps.

There are around 430,000 Sikhs in the UK, making up a significant proportion of the British Punjabi population. Harjinder herself is Sikh and amongst her community her experience isn't unique.

A new survey, commissioned by the BBC to investigate attitudes to alcohol among British Sikhs, found that - although drinking alcohol is forbidden in Sikhism - 27% of British Sikhs report having someone in their family with an alcohol problem. It's a problem which is rarely talked about openly in the community.

More than 1,000 British Sikhs responded to the survey - find out more using this interactive tool:

Harjinder moved in with her husband's family after their arranged marriage - both common practices within Punjabi and wider South Asian communities. She was shocked to find out how much her newly acquired family's social life centred around the men's excessive drinking.

The family, along with young children, would go to a friend's house and would stay there until two or three o'clock in the morning waiting for the men, and she started to feel increasingly isolated.

Rav Sekhon, a British Punjabi psychotherapist who works with ethnic minority communities, says: ""There is really strong pride and honour for the family name. They don't want anyone to perceive them as having something wrong with them or any form of weakness.""

Sanjay Bhandari is from a Hindu Punjabi family, a partner at a multinational city firm in London and a recovering alcoholic. After his father died when he was 15, he says he started drinking and never really stopped.

By his mid 30s, he realised that he hadn't been a single day without a drink for over seven years, and he'd been dependent on alcohol for much longer. He says his Punjabi background played a big part in discouraging him from admitting he had a problem.

Sanjay, who has been sober for 16 years, says he didn't feel that he could admit he had a weakness, nor that he was feeling lonely and self-medicating with alcohol. He didn't look to the Punjabi community for help, but eventually found Alcoholics Anonymous.

""It would never have occurred to me to go to the community for help with drinking. It was almost the last place I would have gone.""

When the first immigrants, who were mostly men, came to the UK from Punjab in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, many found themselves struggling to assimilate being in a new country, often working long hours to send money home to their families.

The stresses of moving to a new culture, the associated language barriers and the racism they faced meant many of these men turned to alcohol to cope. This reliance on alcohol has had generational repercussions.

Jennifer Shergill, an alcohol practitioner from the West Midlands, works with Sikh men and women to manage and overcome addiction. She points to the combination of British binge drinking and the culture of drinking in Punjab, which together create a perfect storm for some of the people accessing support services.

For Harjinder, her husband's heavy drinking had worsening consequences. Although he was becoming increasingly violent towards her, she was still reluctant to seek help.

She says his behaviour was normalised by his family, leaving her feeling almost brainwashed by them into hopelessly accepting the situation. It wasn't until she went to her GP with injuries from the abuse that she realised that what she was experiencing wasn't normal.

Eventually Harjinder called the police and she and her children moved out of the family home to stay with her parents. Even then her husband didn't acknowledge the impact that his drinking was having.

""I think [my husband] knew deep down that what he was doing was wrong but it was almost as if his male pride couldn't admit it.""

Image copyright Vik Kainth

Jennifer Shergill thinks one of the barriers for people seeking help is the fear of someone finding out. ""There is stigma associated with chronic alcohol misuse and they don't want their reputation to be tainted... if there is a dependent drinker in the family what might people think of our family?""

The Shanti Project, where Jennifer works, is just one scheme working to tackle this stigma and to provide culturally appropriate services for the Punjabi community in Birmingham.

Others include a volunteer-led Sikh Helpline, the Derby Recovery Network, BAC-IN, and First Step Foundation, which are all doing their part to help tackle alcoholism in a culturally sensitive way.

The Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute Harjinder's husband due to a lack of evidence and, six weeks later, Harjinder and her children returned to the home she shared with her husband.

Her husband's family had visited her to assure her he had stopped drinking and things would be different - so feeling the pressure from both his family and her own, she and her children returned home.

But Harjinder struggled with depression. Her husband hadn't stopped drinking. It was at this point that - prompted by a community psychiatric nurse - she started talking to a counsellor. ""I felt quite desperate at times,"" she says, ""but the counselling really helped, I felt that I could carry on.""

Harjinder is still living with her husband after more than 20 years of marriage, but their lives are very separate now. Her daughter, now in her 20s, constantly urges her to leave him.

""I've thought about it a lot. A part of me thinks, why bother at this age? But then another part of me thinks: well, if I've got another 20 years of this, that's not good. I think it could happen.""

Harjinder and her family members' names have been changed.

Sir Anthony Hopkins has opened up on his battle with alcoholism, saying he ""should have died in Wales, drunk or something like that"".

The Oscar-winning star admitted he was ""very difficult to work with"" early in his stage career because he ""was usually hungover"".

He said he turned his life around following a talk with a woman from Alcoholics Anonymous in 1975.

Sir Anthony, 80, was born in Port Talbot but now lives in Los Angeles.

Speaking to about 500 students at the University Of California, the Silence Of The Lambs star discussed his problems with alcohol and the impact it had on his early career.

He said: ""Because that's what you do in theatre, you drink. But I was very difficult to work with, as well, because I was usually hungover.""

Sir Anthony added he had been ""disgusted, busted and not to be trusted"" while he was drinking.

The actor told how he started to change following the talk with the Alcoholics Anonymous woman, who asked him ""why don't you just trust in God?"".

From then on the urge to drink was ""never to return"", he added.

Sir Anthony, who was knighted in 1993 for services to the arts, said he got into acting ""because he had nothing better to do"", adding he was ""not at all bright"" in school and was often bullied.

""I believe that we are capable of so much,"" he told the students at the 11th annual Leap, Leadership, Excellence and Accelerating Your Potential conference.

""From my own life, I still cannot believe that my life is what it is because I should have died in Wales, drunk or something like that.""

Should there be a word for an 'almost alcoholic'?,"Everybody thinks they know what an ""alcoholic"" is, but what about those who drink too much but fall short of the common definitions of alcoholism?",,None,"Image copyright Thinkstock

Everybody thinks they know what an ""alcoholic"" is, but what about those who drink too much but fall short of the common definitions of alcoholism? Should there be a word that bridges the gap between alcoholic and non-alcoholic?

The term alcoholic - on its own to denote someone addicted to alcohol - was first used in 1852 in the Scottish Temperance Review.

Since then, millions of heavy drinkers have been confronted by friends and families with the stark question: ""Are you an alcoholic?""

And millions have denied it. Rejected the label. Confessed only to maybe, possibly drinking too much. But utterly denied the A-word.

Alcoholics are people who fall asleep in skips. Alcoholics get into fights. Alcoholics start the day with a shot of whisky. Alcoholics are drunk all the time. Alcoholics can't hold down jobs.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Scottish clergyman Rev Thomas Guthrie (centre), an advocate of temperance

None of the above is necessarily true, but the intensely negative nature of the word alcoholic leaves some people scrabbling for an alternative.

""There is so much stigma,"" says Kate, author of the blog The Sober Journalist. People are so frightened of it - their head fills with images of men drinking under bridges. ""There is this huge number of people out there who don't fit that stereotype but perhaps their drinking isn't quite normal.""

Warning signs Image copyright Getty Images In their book Almost Alcoholic, Robert Doyle and Joseph Nowinski identify five signs that someone may be an ""almost alcoholic"": You continue to drink despite at least some negative consequences

You look forward to drinking.

You drink alone.

You sometimes drink in order to control emotional and/or physical symptoms.

You and your loved ones are suffering as a result of your drinking

Kate went to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings when she started to think she was drinking too much, about four or five years ago. ""I felt I was out of place, I wasn't alcoholic enough. I felt that everyone else had worse problems with drinking than I did,"" she says.

There are other words for people who drink a lot. There is everything from the lightly derogatory ""lush"" to the more flowery ""bibulous"" to the prosaic ""heavy drinker"".

But there is nothing as succinct as alcoholic. And some believe that this gap has an effect.

Professionals have started using other terms that would not be as negative as alcoholic because ""many doctors feel that it is quite difficult to engage a patient if you talk to them about alcoholism"", says Dr Sarah Jarvis, a consultant for Patient.co.uk.

People have such vivid mental images of what it means to be an alcoholic that they measure themselves against that standard and do not seek help.

""They all have an idea of what an alcohol or problem drinker is but there is a different pattern for every drinker,"" Jarvis says.

Not all experts share this view, however.

There's a danger that avoiding the term ""alcoholism"" will only serve ""to reassure people their drinking is OK when it isn't"", says Moira Plant, emeritus professor of alcohol studies at the University of the West of England.

Image copyright Hulton Archive Image caption The term inebriate was popular in the 19th Century

She agrees the widespread impression of the alcoholic as a vagrant or street-drinker prevents higher-functioning people with drink problems from seeking help. But she says the best way to tackle this is to correct false stereotypes, not downplay the situation faced by such individuals - many of whom are already in denial.

""People normalise heavy drinking,"" she says. ""They tend to overestimate what everyone else drinks. They say, 'I don't drink as much as my friends so it's OK.'""

There have been other words to describe someone drinking too much. In the 19th Century ""inebriate"" was a popular term and the word ""drunkard"" goes all the way back to the 15th Century.

England's Department of Health recommends that men should not regularly drink more than three to four units of alcohol a day and women should not regularly drink more than two to three units a day.

But drinking above these recommendations does not necessarily mean that the person is an alcoholic. It just means increased risk of health damage.

""An alcoholic is anyone who is dependent on alcohol and who is drinking to a level that will endanger their health,"" Dr Jarvis says.

The term alcoholic is very much alive in the vocabulary of ordinary people, says Tim Leighton, director of professional education and research at Action on Addiction.

""In Europe and in the UK, there was a move away from the term in the 1960s; it was seen as derogatory. We now talk about 'alcohol dependence', but you don't hear people in the street saying he is an 'alcohol dependent,' they say he is an 'alcoholic,'"" he says.

Dr Jarvis says it is a shame the words ""hazardous"" or ""harmful"" drinker aren't used more widely.

The issue with the use of the word ""alcoholic"" is that it is narrow. ""You are either one or you are not,"" Leighton says. ""This is why some people prefer the term 'alcohol dependence'. You can be an alcoholic without drinking too much - it is all about dependence, about losing control.""

For a long time, it was a strict category, there were specific criteria and if you fulfilled these criteria, you were an alcoholic, says Joseph Nowinski, one of the authors of the book Almost Alcoholic.

This is a stage for a lot of controversy - as long as you didn't meet the alcoholic criteria, you would say, ""I am not an alcoholic so I don't have a drinking problem"", he says.

""There has never been a word for people who come to the point of asking themselves the question, 'Do I have a problem or not?'""

Based on this, Nowinski and Robert Doyle came up with the concept of being an ""almost alcoholic"" to describe people who are not alcoholics but who ""fall into a grey area of problem drinking"".

""The almost alcoholic zone is actually quite large. The people who occupy it are not alcoholics. Rather, they are men and women whose drinking habits range from barely qualifying as almost alcoholics to those whose drinking borders on abuse,"" they wrote in the Atlantic.

""An expanded view of drinking behaviour in terms of a spectrum as opposed to discrete categories might be viewed by some as opening the door to over-diagnosing the associated problems. We believe the opposite will prove to be the case: that this paradigm shift will allow people to recognise problems earlier and to seek solutions without having to be labelled as alcoholics.""

""There is a huge range of alcohol problems,"" Leighton says. ""A lot of people with alcohol problems are not alcoholics.""

Until a new label is popularised there will be people who struggle to admit they have a problem, he says.

But for Kate, the existing term has come to make sense as her recovery has progressed.

""I feel that eight months ago I wouldn't have said that I was an alcoholic and now I could say I am because I know what it means,"" she says.

UK Punjabi alcohol support services 'see rise in users',The reports follow a BBC survey suggesting 27% of British Sikhs have a family member with a problem.,,None,"Image copyright Vik Kainth

Some ethnic minority alcohol support services have seen an increase in inquiries following a BBC survey suggesting that, despite Sikhism forbidding drinking, 27% of UK Sikhs had a family member with a problem.

They reported a rise in contacts from both alcoholics and volunteers.

Nottingham's Bac-In has seen an almost sixfold increase in website hits.

And UK Punjabi services the First Step Foundation and the Shanti Project have also seen an increase in interest.

Sohan Sahota, of Bac-In said: ""Average website hits are around 2,000 a month. We've had over 11,500 hits since the article.""

Jaz Rai, director of the First Step Foundation, which works with UK Punjabis across England, said it had doubled the size of its weekly support group and was planning a women-only meeting to address the increased demand.

The Shanti Project, which works to provide culturally appropriate services for the Punjabi community in Birmingham, has also seen an increase.

Tina, a British Punjabi mother-of-two, contacted the BBC after reading its coverage of the issue.

The reports resonated very strongly with her own experiences, she said.

Her husband - a heavy drinker - had been emotionally abusive towards her, Tina said, trying to convince her that she was going mad, and taking out loans in her name to finance his drinking after losing his job as a plumber.

""There's so much going on in Asian families that no-one addresses,"" she said. ""I just want our culture to open up.

""People need to wake up and realise that alcohol is poison,"" she said. ""I don't want my kids to go through what I went through. I don't want my daughter to think that it's normal.""

Sharing stories about addiction can play a key role in the path to recovery, according to Alcoholics Anonymous.

Recovering alcoholic Sanjay Bhandari told the BBC: ""The thing that resonated most with me was to hear other people's stories.

""What they experienced, what it was like, and how things got better gave me hope and inspiration, 'Well I can do that.'""

The BBC's coverage sparked a discussion on social media, involving Sikh MPs, support services, and people directly affected by the issue.

Talking about the issue openly was a good first step towards challenging cultural norms and tackling the problem head on, said Jasvir Singh, on BBC Radio 4's Thought for the Day programme.

""To overcome any fear of shame, it's important to look at alcohol misuse as a health condition and treat it with empathy and understanding rather than condemnation and judgement of the person or their family.""

Dependency

NHS figures suggest nine in every 100 men and four in every 100 women show signs of alcohol dependence.

Drinking alcohol becomes a focus in daily life, meaning the person no longer has control over their drinking and depends on it to get through the day.

You don't necessarily have to be rolling around drunk to have a dependency on alcohol - people may be able to hold down a career and drink in a way that is damaging.

Dependency mean you are physically and psychologically tied to booze - you feel compelled to drink and this takes its toll on your physical and emotional health.

Julie Rogers has been working in the addiction field for 12 years, helping people who are hooked on alcohol.

Ms Rogers, who works with the charity Foundation 66, says problem drinking is a complex and incredibly difficult behaviour to break. No two people are the same and there is no single approach that is guaranteed to work.

""Alcohol addiction does not have any boundaries. It affects all types of people alike. It doesn't matter if you are wealthy or poor.

Warning signs of alcohol dependence Worrying about where your next drink is coming from and planning social, family and work events around alcohol

Finding you have a compulsive need to drink and finding it hard to stop once you start

Waking up and drinking - or feeling the need to have a drink in the morning

Suffering from withdrawal symptoms, such as sweating, shaking and nausea, which stop once you drink alcohol

""And there are so many different reasons why people drink. But the thing they do have in common is that, for them, alcohol has become more than just a drink.

""It becomes something that you need to do to cope and get through. That's when it becomes a problem.""

For some, the trigger is stress or anxiety - a demanding job or a traumatic divorce, for example.

She said for others it is a learned behaviour - something they have been exposed to during their childhood and have grown up to follow the same path.

Genetics can also make some people susceptible, experts suspect.

Breaking the cycle

Regardless of the cause, the first step to tackling addiction is the same.

Ms Rogers said: ""Recognising you have a problem and then seeking help is the first step.

""It sounds simple but, in reality it's not. It can be hard to admit you have a problem and actually do something about it.""

The former Newcastle, Tottenham and Lazio player has tried hard to fight his addiction, spending repeated spells in rehab over the last decade.

Alcohol harms Short term health risks include alcohol poisoning and accidents and injuries

Long term health consequences include an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, liver disease (which can cause jaundice), pancreatitis and certain cancers

Drinking too much can also affect your relationships and your ability to hold down a job

It can lead to anxiety, depression and suicidal feelings

Gazza's drinking problems started during his playing days.

In 1998, shortly after his divorce from wife Sheryl, he was admitted to the The Priory Hospital in Marchwood, near Southampton, to receive treatment for stress and drink problems.

In 2001, whilst playing at Everton, Gascoigne admitted himself to an alcohol rehabilitation clinic in Arizona on the insistence of his then manager Walter Smith.

Four years after retiring, in 2008, he was arrested in Newcastle and detained under the Mental Health Act and was later sectioned following reports that he was acting strangely in Hemel Hempstead.

More recently he has been treated at The Priory again and the Providence Projects treatment centre in Bournemouth.

Ms Rogers says relapses are incredibly common, and they shouldn't be seen as a failure.

""It's important that we do not judge relapse because that just compounds the shame and guilt people feel about it.

Dennis' story I took my first drink in my early teens. There were consequences from my drinking from the beginning, very small at first: arguing with friends, turning up late for social appointments, losing keys, urinating in alleyways, and general behaviours I would not engage in when I wasn't drinking. As I reached my 20s I had destroyed a marriage by now, and I was well on that alcoholic slippery downhill slope. I was starting to lose jobs as I could not be trusted to turn up for work. Into my 30s, my drinking very subtly but progressively got worse; the dry spells between my binges got shorter and shorter. I had started too waken up in strange places and also in A&E hospitals and couldn't remember how I got there. The last 10 years of my drinking, I had tried many avenues of escape in order to stop drinking completely and failed every single time. At 40 years old I was truly beaten by alcohol. I had heard and of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and had visited AA meetings in the past but nothing else, I would visit and then leave and eventually always drink again. I did not know what it was to be an alcoholic, and I had not fully admitted to myself that I was an alcoholic. Now, through AA's 12-step recovery programme, I have a productive, contented life with complete abstinence from alcohol.

""Relapse can be part of recovery. That's when they really learn to move on. I've worked with people who have relapsed 20 or 30 times and have got there in the end.

""Even if it is your thousandth relapse, it can still be the last. It's important not to give up.""

She said in order to break the cycle some people need to hit a critical point where it's ""stop drinking or die"".

Help on hand

But for others, abstinence is never an option.

Instead, they might work towards curbing their intake, even if it means they are still drinking far too much for good health.

""Some people reduce the harm rather than stop drinking.

""Some relapse every few months but still lead a fulfilling life. Even if you get a month of sobriety at least it's a month.""

She said there is plenty of help available to anyone struggling to keep their drinking under control.

""Your first port of call should be your GP who can direct you to your local alcohol services.""

Support may include home-based and community detoxification programmes, counselling and group work.

Friends and family also have a role to play.

Friend and former England player Alan Shearer has said: ""It won't be easy, but he [Gazza] needs to dig deep and find the energy and the will to do it.

""What he needs to know most of all is that he is loved.""","['drink', 'alcohol', 'work', 'grip', 'drinking', 'stop', 'addiction', 'living', 'rogers', 'thats', 'need', 'alcoholic']","Drinking alcohol becomes a focus in daily life, meaning the person no longer has control over their drinking and depends on it to get through the day.

Eminem celebrates a decade of being sober,The rapper has been clean since the end of 2007.,,None,"Image copyright Getty Images

Eminem has revealed he's been sober for ten years.

On Saturday, in between headlining Coachella, he posted a photo of himself with an Alcoholics Anonymous coin which signifies sobriety.

""Celebrated my 10 years yesterday,"" the rapper wrote on Instagram - which received more than 1.6 million likes.

Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, was addicted to prescription medication and nearly died of an accidental methadone overdose in 2007.

At the height of his addiction the rapper was reportedly taking up to 20 pills a day.

The 8 Mile actor credits his children for helping him recover and previously revealed he replaced addiction with exercise.

The 45-year-old said running and working out was key to giving him endorphins, which also meant he managed to sleep.

People tweeted him messages of congratulations, including rapper Royce Da 59.

Other people shared their stories of addiction recovery and pictures of their AA coins.

What is an Alcoholics Anonymous coin?

Also known as AA tokens, recovery medallions, sobriety coins or 24 hour chips - they are given out in the US to people during their journey to overcoming addictions.

They bear the circle and triangle symbol used by Alcoholics Anonymous with the words ""unity"", ""service"" and ""recovery"".

On the one Eminem posted on Instagram, the token has the Roman numeral 'X' in the centre of a triangle - which represents 10 years of being sober.

Smashed: Mary Elizabeth Winstead on playing an alcoholic,An independent film about an elementary schoolteacher with a drinking problem has been tipped as a potential awards contender. BBC News speaks to its director and stars.,,None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Leading lady Mary Elizabeth Winstead tells the BBC why she took on her most dramatic role to date

A low-budget independent film about an elementary schoolteacher with a drinking problem has been tipped as a potential awards contender. BBC News spoke to its director and stars.

Movie awards voters tend to be impressed by hard-hitting studies of alcoholism, regularly rewarding films that have highlighted the perils of the demon drink.

Ray Milland won an Oscar in 1946 for playing a drunkard in The Lost Weekend, as did Nicolas Cage, 50 years later, for imbibing himself to death in Leaving Las Vegas.

Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne and Jeff Bridges were also given Hollywood's highest accolade for playing characters partial to a tipple.

It can work for actresses too. Elizabeth Taylor received her second Oscar for playing a boozy harridan in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, while Lee Remick got a nomination for going blotto in Days of Wine and Roses.

All of which bodes well for Mary Elizabeth Winstead, whose portrayal of Kate, a young wife trying to stay off the sauce in the independent film Smashed, is being tipped as a dark horse in this year's awards race.

Only last month, she was nominated for a Spirit award, alongside Jennifer Lawrence (from Silver Linings Playbook) and child performer Quvenzhane Wallis (from Beasts of the Southern Wild).

Could an Oscar nomination follow in January? During a visit to London last month, the 28-year-old was studiously playing down her chances.

'Wonderful imagination'

""I'm very aware my chances are not very high so I'm not getting my hopes up,"" says the actress, previously seen in quirky movies like Scott Pilgrim vs The World and Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof.

""But it's lovely to hear anyone say anything like that about a performance I've done, and I certainly can't help but fantasise about the idea of being a part of it in some way.""

""I had seen Mary in big action films like Die Hard 4.0 and the remake of The Thing,"" says Smashed director James Ponsoldt, whose work won a special jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival last January.

Image caption Paul (left) is known to US TV audiences for playing Jesse Pinkman in Breaking Bad

""But spending time with her, I realised what a wonderful imagination she has and how willing she was to really prepare for this role.""

Those sentiments are shared by actor Aaron Paul, who took a break from playing a crystal meth dealer in TV's Breaking Bad to appear as Charlie, Kate's free-spirited, perennially intoxicated husband.

""The goal in this business is to get lost in the scenes and truly feel like you're living moments as if they were your own,"" says the 33-year-old.

""That happened pretty much every day on set with Mary. It was great and a wonderful experience.""

Should accolades come in Smashed's direction, it would be quite a coup for a film shot in just 19 days for a reported $500,000 (£312,557).

Not only that, but it would also surely be the first movie so honoured to feature a teacher publicly relieving herself on a convenience store floor.

For Winstead, used to projecting glamorous self-assurance on red carpets and in photo shoots, fabricating something so indecorous and unladylike must have posed a challenge.

Apparently, though, such considerations were secondary compared to the need to make an artificial bladder function on cue.

'Not propaganda'

""What's funny in scenes like that is that sometimes the technical aspects end up overriding everything else,"" the actress smiles.

""I was wearing this... 'device', and when I sat down I had to put my arm on my leg to activate it.

""And it wasn't working - every take it wasn't working. On every take everyone was behind the camera going, 'Is it going to work?'

""So it really got rid of all of the humiliation of doing that scene, because all the focus was on hoping that it worked and that we could actually get the scene done.""

Winstead's character is driven to seek help from Alcoholics Anonymous, much to the chagrin of her hard-drinking husband.

Image caption The cast of Smashed includes Octavia Spencer (right), who won an Oscar this year for The Help

The film takes a fairly uncritical view of the organisation, which is depicted by Ponsoldt and his co-writer Susan Burke as a benignly tolerant force for social good.

""Susan and I have very complicated feelings towards AA,"" says the director. ""We both know people whose lives have been saved by it, and we know people who left because they thought it was a cult.

""We didn't want to glorify it; this is certainly not a propaganda film. Nor did we want to take easy shots at it.

""We just wanted the scenes at AA to feel honest and true, so we went to great lengths to make sure they were accurate.""

As graphic as Smashed becomes, particularly when Paul and Winstead's characters are at their most inebriated, it is not inconceivable the film could benefit the organisation.

Winstead is happy for it to have a dual purpose, saying it would be ""fantastic"" if the film was ""used in any sort of positive way"".

""People have come up to me after screenings who work with alcoholics and feel it would be a great tool for them to use,"" she says.

""I think the reason they feel that way is it feels more real than other films on the subject, and a lot more relatable to people of this generation.""

'Recovery point'

Smashed is not the only film around at present to have an alcoholic protagonist. Another is Flight, out in the UK in February, in which Denzel Washington plays an airline pilot waging his own battle with the bottle.

Winstead admits it is ""interesting"" for the two to emerge at the same time but insists that they are ""very different films"".

""Smashed is about a person getting their life together, while Flight is about somebody in the throes of alcoholism who can't get to that recovery point,"" she muses.

Image caption Denzel Washington plays a pilot in Flight found to be harbouring a dark secret

""Although they are both anchored and rooted in alcoholism, they tell very different stories.""

""I think it's funny in a quirky, cosmic way that they both came out so close to each other,"" laughs Ponsoldt. ""I just wish we had Flight's marketing budget.

""But I see it as a win for everybody. The world is better when both the independents and studios are making movies for adults that deal with serious issues that pertain to everyone's lives.""

So how does one set about playing an addict? For Aaron Paul, the most effective route to finding his character was also the simplest.

""What I did for research was drink - a lot more than I had ever in my entire life,"" he reveals. ""I filmed myself getting severely intoxicated and I studied the tapes.

""I also went onto YouTube and typed in 'drunk people acting crazy',"" he continues. ""It's incredible what you can find out there.""

Russia: Government mobile app to help alcoholics,New government app aims to help recovering alcoholics and drug addicts.,,None,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Russia has one of the highest alcohol-related mortality rates in the world

The Russian government is trying to tackle the country's notoriously high alcoholism rate with the launch of a free mobile app.

The app will provide information for ""people battling addictions that are very hard to fight"" in order to help them to stay clean, says Yevgeny Bryun, the health ministry's leading narcotics official. He tells the M24 news website that it will offer details of nearby support meetings for recovering alcoholics and drug addicts, medical advice on keeping the problem under control, and access to online radio programmes run by Alcoholics Anonymous.

The app should be up and running next year, but Mr Bryun says other resources are already being made available, including a new radio network for rehabilitation clinics, where ""specialists and alcoholics will talk about recovering"".

Experts are lining up in support of the plan, which they see as a serious attempt to tackle what Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has called Russia's drinking-culture ""national disaster"". ""Information technology can play a very important role here, as you can't change these patients with pills,"" Dr Oleg Zykov, a leading Moscow drugs specialist, tells M24.

Russian men are estimated to drink about 70% more pure alcohol than their American counterparts, and United Nations figures suggest alcohol was the main culprit in 30% of all deaths in Russia in 2012. Government incentives, penalties and price hikes seem to be making little difference. But the ideas keep on coming. In Moscow, a pilot scheme will see the city's health department issue certificates to people who stay clean, and the head of Russia's anti-drugs service has even suggested devoting a television channel to helping people beat their addictions.

"'So drunk my daughter, 12, made my meals'","As more women are treated for drink problems, one mother tells how her evening glass of wine turned into full-blown alcoholism.",,None,"Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Women's alcohol consumption is catching up with men

""My daughter told me she didn't like the fact that I always smelt of wine. That was probably the point I thought I may have a problem.""

What started as a few glasses of wine in the evening with her husband quickly developed into full-blown alcoholism for Alice, a mother of one from Birmingham.

She's one of a growing number of women dealing with a drink problem, with recent statistics showing women are nearing equality with men in alcohol consumption.

But as the shame of her addiction eventually forced her to seek help, she found several barriers in her way as a woman and mother seeking treatment.

Her problems with alcohol started at the age of 33 when she married and had a child.

""My then husband used to like popping to the local for one or two drinks before bed. Once our child was born this led onto opening a bottle of wine each evening and this is when the pattern started.

""Over the years it went from sharing one bottle to sharing two-plus. Then it moved to having a drink as soon as I got home from work about 4pm.""

Need help or support?

Need help or support?

Her marriage eventually broke down, and Alice sought more comfort from the bottle.

Alcohol was no longer a treat in the home, but became part of her daily routine, regularly drinking alone. She didn't see as dangerous at the time.

""We hear horror stories of binge drinking but not about the middle class consumption of wine or a gin and tonic in the evening.

""When I grew up men went out to the pub and drank, women less so because alcohol was not generally available in the home except for special occasions. Things have equalised.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alice said Alcoholics Anonymous meetings were too 'male dominated'

Alice was signed off work with depression whilst dealing with her divorce, and after a day of drinking would often be inebriated by the time her daughter came home from school.

Her daughter often had to do the household chores she was unable to complete. ""She made tea on a number of occasions,"" recalls Alice.

""I had taken an 'overdose' on a couple of occasions - never serious attempts just feeling drunk and wretched. My daughter was about 12 at the time and she was becoming increasingly fearful about how much I was drinking.""

This, combined with GP blood tests, made her realise how much damage she was doing to herself and those around her.

Alice initially tried to seek help at AA meetings, but struggled with their 'male dominated' environment and could never find childcare for her daughter.

""There needs to be women only groups and support groups to help with childcare so they can attend appointments and meetings.""

""I think that women, especially single women, have more of an issue because they fear social service involvement and losing their children"".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alcohol related problems are increasing amongst women

After finding AA unsuccessful, she was referred to a support worker from the charity Change, Grow, Live who helped her with recovery on an individual basis near her home in Birmingham. They helped Alice set goals to help her see beyond drinking.

""One of the goals I set in early recovery was to join a choir, which I am still enjoying. I have now had a whole raft of excellent experiences.""

Knowing the risks

Defeating alcoholism also made Alice find some compromises in her life, which involved stepping back from career aspirations to focus on her family.

""I don't need to overdo it by working full-time. I spend more, and less stressful, time with the kids.""

The theme of Alcohol Awareness Week 2016, which ends on 20 November, is ""knowing the risks"" - getting people thinking about why they drink, and ""how it affects us as individuals, families, communities and society as a whole.""

Sian Warmer, head of services at CGL, the charity that helped Alice, says they help people identify why they are turning to drink.

""The reasons people use substances, whether they are drugs or alcohol, are endless and often very unique to the individual.

""We recognise that these people may have complex needs, involving things such as domestic violence, pregnancy, mental health and sex work.""","['image', 'helped', 'meals', 'alcohol', 'alice', 'wine', 'work', 'occasions', 'women', 'drunk', 'help', 'daughter', '12']","Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Women's alcohol consumption is catching up with men""My daughter told me she didn't like the fact that I always smelt of wine.

Recovery movement helps addicts kick the habit in Liverpool,"How former addicts in Liverpool are trying a new programme to kick the habit, as figures show deaths from alcohol are on the increase.",,None,"Image caption Addicts on the Recovery programme are hoping to kick the habit for good

""Ah boom chikka boom!"" sings the choir leader. ""Ah boom chikka boom! "" sing back the twenty or so members of the choir.

The Raucous Caucus Recovery Chorus is made up mainly of former drug users and alcoholics from Liverpool.

They rehearse in a small room at an addiction charity office and you have to be sober to sing: all members pledge that they've been off drink or drugs for at least 24 hours.

Being in the choir is part of the treatment for these former users, doing something normal like singing with other people.

But the choir has a wider significance as the public face of a new programme in tackling addiction called Recovery - a movement in which Liverpool is playing a leading role.

Rather than manage an addiction with drug substitutes or controlled drinking, people go through detox and then practise total abstinence.

'Animal existence'

Drink-related deaths in the North West are among the highest with men accounting for two-thirds of such deaths in the UK.

And figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the problem is getting worse.

In the Land of Recovery, it's the guinea pigs that wear the white coats. Mark Gilman , NHS Treatment Agency

More people in the UK died from alcohol-related conditions in 2010 than in 2009 with the figure rising by 126 to 8,790 from 8,664.

But to understand why Liverpool is leading the way in this new idea, we need to go back in time.

In the 1980s, it was one of the cities to bear the brunt of a new drug problem - the arrival of brown powder heroin.

Addicts stole to feed their cravings, and transmitted HIV and other infections by using dirty needles.

To cut crime and improve health, Liverpool was one of the first places to pioneer harm reduction treatments.

Users were prescribed methadone to keep them off heroin. It worked, but many people spent years on methadone, and remained addicts.

Raucous Caucus singer Colin used drugs for 22 years, and was on methadone for 17.

""I'd have done anything for my drugs."" he said. ""I lived an animal existence.""

Now, being in the choir is vital for him.

""I love it,"" he said. ""It's really positive for me.""

Children of addicts

The idea of Recovery, of staying off drink and drugs for good, has been around for some time.

Image caption Former addict Colin has been off drugs for two years thanks to the Recovery programme

It started in America, but is now taking hold in the UK.

Liverpool is still a relatively poor city with high unemployment and poor housing which partly explains why drug and drink addiction is so high; there are twelve Alcoholics Anonymous meetings here every week.

It also explains why Liverpool is at the forefront of the movement in England.

Jacquie Johnston-Lynch, of Action on Addiction, said: ""Liverpool has the highest number of [Recovery] Fellowships per head of population in Europe.""

Liverpool was where the UK's first Recovery March took place in 2009 and Action on Addiction has opened an alcohol-free bar called The Brink.

But the idea of ""Recovery"" has sparked furious debate in drug treatment circles.

Some don't like the idea of users taking more responsibility for their own treatment.

Mark Gilman, leader of the NHS Treatment Agency, said: ""In the Land of Recovery, it's the guinea pigs that wear the white coats.""

But Martin says Recovery is important because it could put an end to the problem where the children of addicts become addicts themselves.

""If you get this right, you're the firewall between the intergenerational transfer of addiction,"" he said.

""It sounds grand, but that's the prize on offer.""","['helps', 'kick', 'recovery', 'habit', 'choir', 'addicts', 'drugs', 'users', 'treatment', 'addiction', 'boom', 'drug', 'idea', 'liverpool', 'movement']","Image caption Addicts on the Recovery programme are hoping to kick the habit for good""Ah boom chikka boom!""

AA: America's Gift to the World,"AL Kennedy's new Radio 4 documentary - AA: America's Gift to the World - tells the story of Alcoholics Anonymous and its methods, and asks whether AA is still the best 'cure' for addicts given new science and treatments.",,2015-04-01T13:36:32+00:00,"AL Kennedy's new Radio 4 documentary - America's Gift to the World - tells the story of Alcoholics Anonymous and its methods, and asks whether AA is still the best 'cure' for addicts given new science and treatments. This is the background to the story, and how the making of the programme impacted on its presenter.

The initials AA are peripherally familiar to many, as is perhaps the name Alcoholics Anonymous. Nevertheless, I think a lot of people don’t know much about AA or the story of its creation – when Bill Wilson, an alcoholic wall street trader with a big idea about staying sober, met an alcoholic doctor, Bob Smith. They talked and understood each other, helped each other get sober and worked out a way they could pass that on. I’ve seen friends ruin their own lives and those of all around them through dysfunctional drinking: the idea of two people finding a way to unravel that nightmare is truly beautiful and fascinating.

AA’s desire to preserve its members' privacy and to make no grand statements on issues, meant we had to be sensitive about interviews. It’s also probably one reason why AA isn’t well-known outside its membership. AA’s also an intentionally disorganised organisation. I loved looking at a huge association which seems to do exactly what it intends and yet which is specifically engineered to concentrate power and responsibility downwards and to avoid creating authority figures, funding drives, advertising drives and so forth. It seems to reverse modern thinking about success, but has millions of members, has lasted 80 years and still rolls on.

With so many products and experiences now designed to exert an addictive or pseudo-addictive influence, I suppose AA pushes against some powerful trends in society. As was pointed out during my research, alcohol use is central to many of our social occasions, celebrations, even some religious ceremonies. Anyone trying to stay away from drink isn’t going to have it easy. AA isn’t for everyone, but it seems to work very well for those who do use it.

What I was struck by most of all was the generosity, honesty and compassion of all our contributors. We have hours of wonderful stories and insights that we just couldn’t fit into the programme. The professionals we spoke to were genuinely passionate about trying to understand alcoholism and help alcoholics to recover. AA members were searingly frank about themselves – and very funny - and really had a grip on who they were and how they could meet the world. We also interviewed Al-Anon and Alateen members – those affected by the drinking of others. Their experiences and bravery were startling, humbling. It was really a privilege to meet them all.

Former alcoholic Campbell admits to 'odd drink since 1999',Former alcoholic Alastair Campbell has told BBC 5 live's Richard Bacon that he has had the 'occasional drink' since 1999 - when he drank a glass of wine while at work as Director of Communications for Tony Blair 'to test myself.',,None,"Video

The former director of communications at 10 Downing Street, Alastair Campbell, has admitted he drank a glass of wine while working for the then prime minister Tony Blair to 'test' himself as a recovering alcoholic.

Talking to BBC 5 live's Richard Bacon about his new novel, which charts the demise of an alcoholic woman, Mr Campbell said he was on his own in an embassy in Germany when he drank alcohol for the first time in 13 years.

Devon SMART Recovery groups for addicts to expand,A group which offers science-based support for addicts plans to expand its service in Devon.,,None,"Image caption There are 80 SMART recovery groups in the UK and about 650 worldwide

A group which offers science-based support for people with alcohol, drug and gambling addictions plans to expand its service in Devon.

Self Management and Recovery Training (SMART) uses motivational, behavioural and cognitive methods.

The NHS Devon Drug and Alcohol Action Team is spending £4,000 to help it form more groups in the county.

SMART Recovery currently has seven groups and hopes to open a further 10 in the next two years.

The organisation said it gives people alternatives to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA).

'Addictive behaviour'

SMART Recovery uses a four-step plan which helps participants decide whether they have a problem, builds up their motivation to change and offers a set of techniques to support recovery, a spokesperson said.

Richard Phillips, director of SMART Recovery, said: ""We have evidence that all the individual techniques work.

""Clearly AA and NA work very well for some people, for other people SMART Recovery might work better.

""Our approach is very much to place the responsibility of change within the individual, they've got the ability to choose to change their addictive behaviour.""

Kristian Tomblin, from the Devon Drug and Alcohol Action Team, said it was important to have a range of services in place to accommodate different needs.

Mr Phillips said there was 650 groups worldwide with 80 in the UK.

Activities offer hope to recovering addicts,People recovering from drug and alcohol addiction in Gwynedd and Anglesey have been boosted by a new charity which offers support day and night.,,None,"Image caption More than 70 people have contacted AGRO at Holyhead and Bangor since last September

People recovering from drug and alcohol addiction in Gwynedd and Anglesey have been boosted by a new charity which offers support day and night.

The Anglesey and Gwynedd Recovery Organisation (AGRO) uses activities like gardening and group sessions to support people in their bid to give up drink and drugs.

More than 70 people have already approached AGRO's Holyhead and Bangor groups for help since it was set up last September, just through word of mouth recommendation.

Its founders are now starting to publicise their work and have secured funding from the Safer Anglesey and Gwynedd partnerships to set up groups in Amlwch, Llangefni and Caernarfon.

Huw Harries, who is a support worker for the dug and alcohol rehabilitation organisation CAIS by day, co-founded the charity in his spare time using his own funds.

Image caption AGRO hope to soon launch groups in Amlwch, Llangefni and Caernarfon

As a former alcoholic himself, Huw feels able to reach out to those who are also fighting to get sober.

He said: ""I haven't had a drink in 15 years. I used to be a nightclub manager and I suppose I'm on the other side of the fence now.

""I gave up because my wife gave me an ultimatum, saying she'd go back to Scotland if I didn't. I'm so glad I did because she died of cancer two years later and I was able to nurse her with a clear head.""

But after working for CAIS for eight years, Huw realised that those in need had nowhere to turn to in the evenings or weekends.

Now AGRO offer 24-hour phone support to help an addict avoid having another drink or talk them through a period of anxiety.

But AGRO's other aim is to help people to recover through getting involved in new activities.

They have already turned a piece of Holyhead waste ground into a productive vegetable garden and have future plans to acquire more allotments and open a shop to sell their produce. They will plough any profit back into the community.

They also organise walks, kayaking sessions and fishing at weekends to help people get active and have something else to think about.

""It gives people something else to do when they come out of rehab after three or six months,"" explained Huw.

""And people really want to do it. It isn't often you have alcohol and drug addicts working on something together.""

He was spurred on to start the groups on Anglesey after figures suggested more people from the island were admitted into Bangor's Ysbyty Gwynedd with alcohol-related problems than from anywhere in Gwynedd.

But from small beginnings, he see big demand for AGRO's work.

""We have all sorts of members,"" said Huw. ""Students, people who own their own businesses, housewives, unemployed people.

""The days of people drinking all day haven't completely gone, but mostly now people binge-drink when they get stressed, or have a glass or two, or a bottle every night.

""And the price of alcohol doesn't matter. If you want a drink you'll get it, even if there are no buses and you have to walk a long way.

""It's easier to get some alcohol than call a doctor for help at night.""

Although Huw is happy to help those who want to recover, he thinks that educating those who are yet to find themselves in trouble is ultimately the way forward.

""We want to go into schools or go to the WI to educate people about the side-effects of alcohol,"" he said.

""If you catch people early enough, then you'll avoid spending money on A&E or on unemployment, divorce or sorting out the effect on the kids.""

""I've seen the suffering it can cause and want to help people early on.""

Demi Lovato thanks fans as she marks five years sober,Demi Lovato has thanked her fans as she marks five years without an alcoholic drink.,,None,"Demi Lovato has thanked her fans as she marks five years without an alcoholic drink.

The singer posted a heartfelt Instagram message alongside a progress tracker from the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous.

""So grateful. It's been quite the journey. So many ups and downs,"" she wrote.

The 24-year-old has been open about her struggles with substance abuse, eating disorders and depression.

The former Disney Channel star says she turned to drugs and alcohol to cope with the pressures of fame.

In 2010 she checked herself into rehab after a violent argument with a friend and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

Since then she's found help and has become a spokesperson for mental health awareness.

She was honoured with the Artistic Award of Courage earlier this month in LA for her work as a mental health advocate.

Demi's also released a book and a documentary about people who struggle with mental health problems.

""So many times I wanted to relapse but sat on my hands and begged God to relieve the obsession,"" she continues in the Instagram post.

""I'm so proud of myself but I couldn't have done it without my higher power (God), my family, friends, and everyone else who supported me.

""Feeling humbled and joyful today. Thank you guys for sticking by my side and believing in me.""

Gazza rehab: Paul Gascoigne reveals US clinic drama,Football star Paul Gascoigne reveals he thought he was going to die during his most recent spell in rehab in the US.,,None,"Image caption Concerns for Gascoigne's wellbeing were raised again earlier this year

Football star Paul Gascoigne has revealed he thought he was going to die during his most recent spell in rehab.

The former England midfielder has flown back to the UK after more than a month at a clinic in Phoenix, Arizona, that specialises in treating alcoholism.

The 45-year-old told the Sun newspaper that he heard three doctors conclude he was going to pass away, before he slipped into a three-day coma.

His life was saved, but Gascoigne said: ""I thought I was on my way out.""

Fresh fears for the health of Gascoigne, who has battled against alcoholism for several years, emerged at a public appearance in Northampton in January.

'Total wreck'

Within days, he had been flown to the private clinic in the US and Gascoigne - nicknamed Gazza - said he begged its doctors at the clinic to save his life as he went through the detox process.

Alcohol addiction When someone becomes dependent or addicted to alcohol, they: Develop a strong sense of compulsion to drink

May drink shortly after waking to reduce feelings of alcohol withdrawal

Develop a reduced capacity to control how often and how much they drink

Organise their lifestyle around drinking

Continue to drink despite physical or social problems Source: BBC Health The long-term effects of alcohol

""Three doctors didn't think I would make it,"" he said.

""It has got to inspire me to never let this happen again. I've come through that - death. I was dead.""

He added: ""I thought I was on my way out. I looked like a corpse. I was a total wreck.""

Gascoigne, whose football clubs included Newcastle United, Tottenham, Lazio, Rangers and Everton, has had a long-term battle against alcohol addiction.

He said his latest problems started in Dubai last summer when he started drinking alcohol again after 17 months ""dry"". The ex-footballer said he followed that by staying off alcohol for the following six months, but his own despair at his lapse meant that he failed to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and isolated himself, barely eating. ""I was living like a dry drunk,"" he said.

Eventually, he succumbed and started drinking heavily again, a situation which came to public attention at the Northampton charity event when he broke down sobbing on stage.

On his admission to the US treatment centre, Gascoigne's management company said he was alcoholic with ""complex issues"" which were being dealt with by professionals.

It has since emerged that the public appearance could still raise thousands of pounds for charity.

Gascoigne said he had no recollection of being there.

'Another chance'

Gascoigne's drinking problems started during his playing days - he was admitted to the Priory Hospital, near Southampton, in 1998, shortly after his divorce from wife Sheryl.

Three years later, while playing at Everton, Gascoigne admitted himself to an alcohol rehabilitation clinic in Arizona on the insistence of his then manager Walter Smith.

In 2008, four years after retiring, he was arrested in Newcastle and detained under the Mental Health Act.

He was later sectioned following reports that he was acting strangely in Hemel Hempstead.

More recently he has been treated at The Priory again and at the Providence Projects treatment centre in Bournemouth.

Gascoigne told the Sun that the way forward for him now was to start attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings again.

""Meetings are really important. I was too weak, I stopped going to them. I have to start going.

""I should be dead. The doctors said I would not make it. But I'm here, I have another chance - and I'm going to take it.""","['drama', 'problems', 'alcohol', 'way', 'clinic', 'going', 'gascoigne', 'rehab', 'gazza', 'public', 'doctors', 'reveals', 'paul', 'started', 'thought']","Image caption Concerns for Gascoigne's wellbeing were raised again earlier this yearFootball star Paul Gascoigne has revealed he thought he was going to die during his most recent spell in rehab.

Adrian Chiles 'horrified' at drinking 100 alcohol units a week,The TV and radio broadcaster revealed he sometimes drank more than 100 units a week.,,None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Presenter Adrian Chiles speaks about alcohol after revealing he sometimes drank 100 units a week.

Presenter Adrian Chiles has urged people to track their alcohol intake after revealing he sometimes drank 80 or 100 units a week.

The BBC 5 live host said it was ""horrifying"" to add up his alcohol consumption, which was well over the recommended weekly 14 units.

He was told by a doctor he ""can't carry on like this"" and his liver damage could cause cirrhosis or death.

Chiles, 51, has tackled the issue of drinking in a new BBC documentary.

Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Chiles said: ""I was just staggered what I was putting away"".

He said most of his drinking was ""completely mundane and harmless"", adding: ""I don't really get drunk, I don't misbehave, I don't drink during the day, I don't drink alone, I don't particularly stay up late.

""I just drink something every day.

""There are loads of us who just drink too much and I just wondered why I was so dependent on it in a small way, or is it a big way.""

Chiles' comments have prompted many people to speak about their own drinking habits. Actress Linda Robson told ITV's Loose Women she thought ""maybe I could have been on the way to being an alcoholic"" when she used to drink a bottle of wine a night.

She said: ""My big thing was because I didn't drink in the daytime then I didn't have a problem and I could make myself wait until that time every night so I obviously didn't have a problem.

""But I was still functioning, I was still coming into work.""

'We are the problem'

Chiles - who sees himself as a social drinker and not an alcoholic - said he wanted to make the programme after being interested in people's ideas of what type of drinking counts as alcoholism.

For the documentary, called Drinkers Like Us, the TV and radio broadcaster recorded how many units he was drinking.

In an interview with the Times, he said on one morning he calculated that he had drunk more than 100 units in the previous week, whereas other times his weekly amount was 80 units.

The NHS advises men and women not to drink more than 14 units a week - equivalent to six pints of average-strength beer or 10 small glasses of wine.

Chiles said people like him - the ""constant drinkers, the toppers up"" - are ""the problem"".

Although his blood tests were completely normal, a scan showed he had mild to moderate fibrosis of the liver - a type of damage that includes scar tissue forming - and significant liver fat.

The doctor told Chiles: ""You can't carry on like this. You're at risk of disease progression to cirrhosis, liver disease and failure - and death.""

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption In his documentary, Chiles is warned by a doctor: ""You can't carry on like this.""

Chiles said it might be easier to ""stop completely"" rather than moderating his drinking, which he said requires planning.

He said: ""I think middle-aged 'supposedly moderate' drinkers need to take a look at ourselves.

""I encourage anyone, don't judge yourself, don't panic you're not going to drop dead, but go on an app like 'Drink Less' and measure what you're drinking, be honest with yourself for three weeks.""

Chiles, who used to present ITV Breakfast show Daybreak until 2011, has also spoken about his struggle with anxiety and depression.

He told the Radio Times that after first leaving the show he was ""self-medicating with alcohol"".

Pakistan battles growing alcohol addiction,"Alcoholism is a growing problem in Pakistan despite it being illegal for the Muslim majority to drink, reports the BBC's Charles Haviland.",,None,"Image caption Pakistan is supposed to be officially ""dry"" because of its Muslim majority

Alcoholism is a growing problem in Pakistan despite it being illegal for the Muslim majority to drink. The BBC's Charles Haviland finds lives ruined and clinics and therapy groups trying to overcome a taboo subject.

Late one night, the beat of dance music drifts down from an upper storey of an apartment block on the edge of a Pakistani city.

Inside the flat, the music is pulsating around a dance floor. There is a bar where a range of liquor is being served and cocktails shaken. Under flashing stroboscopic lights, dozens of people laugh, dance and enjoy the drink.

This is one of the parties that are now commonplace in the cities but are highly discreet.

The liquor is bought illicitly from bootleggers - or from the regular alcohol shops that are supposed to sell only to minorities holding permits but also sell illegally to large numbers of Muslims.

Pakistan even has its own breweries which officially produce only for non-Muslims - or for export.

'Increasing trend'

Image caption Mr Ahmed was formerly an alcoholic and now runs a rehabilitation organisation

The subculture of liquor enjoyment belies Pakistan's status as officially ""dry"". That is, the 96% of Pakistanis who, according to official figures are Muslim, are not supposed to drink.

The penalty if they do so is 80 lashes but it is not strictly enforced.

Although there are many harmless social gatherings, there is also a growing problem of addiction to the bottle.

Officials have told the BBC - while not wanting to be quoted - that alcohol-related diseases have risen by at least 10% in the past five years.

Tahir Ahmed, a former alcoholic who now runs a rehabilitation organisation, Therapy Works, detects ""a visibly increasing trend"". Six years ago, when he started this work, most drinkers were in at least their 20s; now, some are as young as 14, he says.

I would wake up and I would not remember the last two or three days of my life because I was so intoxicated - and that really frightened me Sara, Alcoholic in Lahore

Sometimes alcohol is taken in conjunction with narcotics.

He says alcohol has a much firmer presence in the home - especially for the affluent - and at social occasions like weddings.

And he says that if a Pakistani drinks, it is usually in large quantities because it is, he believes, a response to the massive social pressures here, including the threat of political violence and high unemployment.

""Unfortunately drinking in Pakistan is not recreational,"" he said. ""It's much more escapist and much more relief-seeking. That means drink till the bottle is emptied.""

Now 65, this is the way he himself used to be. He watched two of his friends die of cirrhosis of the liver and nearly died himself.

He decided to stop drinking but went into clinical depression for a year. Only then did he receive therapy, later setting up his organisation, which is registered with Britain's Counselling and Psychotherapy Central Awarding Body.

'Taboo for women'

Drinking among the affluent is especially noticeable. Some senior politicians are rumoured to drink, and alcohol is served at some high-society events, though never on camera.

But it affects everybody. Last month, at least 12 people in Karachi died after drinking toxic home-made liquor.

Some Pakistani alcoholics are women. For them, the stigma is all the greater.

In Pakistan's second city, Lahore, Sara - whose name we have changed - recounts her story.

Five years ago, aged 33 and with two teenage children, she got divorced. Then alcoholism just sucked her in. She would go binge-drinking for days at a time and suffer blackouts.

""I would wake up and I would not remember the last two or three days of my life because I was so intoxicated. And that really frightened me.""

Image caption Mr Umer said a strict and austere regimen helped him overcome drinking

As word got around and she became an embarrassment to her children, Sara wanted to go to a rehabilitation clinic. But being a woman made this very difficult in Pakistan.

""Some men will turn around and say, 'Okay, I have a problem.' But it's a taboo for women. A woman will never stand up and say I have a problem and I need help. That's not acceptable.""

Nine months ago, she finally sought assistance and was able to get medicine and therapy-based help at home, from Therapy Works. Now she is recovering.

In an unregulated medical market, there are other clinics whose approach to treatment is much more strict. The BBC visited one in Karachi, called Willing Ways, where a group of current and former residents were in a session with the doctor who founded the establishment.

Clients are admitted with their families' consent, but they do not always realise they will be confined for three months. While living there, they are deprived of all addictive substances including tobacco, and of all external communications.

One former patient contacted the BBC and said he felt the set-up was excessively draconian.

But a satisfied former client, businessman Yousuf Umer, says the austere regimen worked for him.

""It has changed my life and I am a very successful man now.""

'I'm listening'

Image caption Dr Mamsa, right, conducts a radio show using a mix of English and Urdu

While clinics and therapy-based groups tackle alcoholism, the media is now doing so too.

On Karachi's Radio 1 91 FM a psychiatrist-broadcaster, Dr Faisal Mamsa, takes calls every Thursday and Friday night on all sorts of social taboos - including this one.

""Go ahead. I'm listening,"" he tells callers in soft tones. Sporting a mop of unruly hair and a beard, he wears shorts in the studio.

There follows a conversation in a mix of English and Urdu.

Calls or texts from affected family members are encouraged. A woman says her husband has been drinking for 13 years but she cannot persuade him to seek help. The doctor suggests they contact Alcoholics Anonymous.

The next caller is an addict who admits he is violent.

Dr Mamsa says the anonymity of radio makes it ideal for this subject.

""I'm not concerned about the name,"" he said.

""If they're talking about a problem, it's not just them who's benefiting out of it but whosoever is listening to the radio is listening about it. What matters is that the problem is being discussed.""

There is no chance of Pakistan's legally ""dry"" status changing in the near future. Yet there is an alcoholism problem, which officials and doctors say is growing.

Scheme to tackle A&E violence introduced in Glasgow,"A project to tackle violence in A&E departments, thought to be the first of its kind in the UK, is operating in Glasgow.",,None,"Image copyright Violence Reduction Unit

A project to tackle violence in A&E departments, thought to be the first of its kind in the UK, has been introduced in Glasgow.

The Navigators Scheme, funded by Police Scotland's Violence Reduction Unit, has been operating at Glasgow Royal Infirmary (GRI) since December.

It involves two navigators establishing a connection with people who are victims or perpetrators of violence.

They later discuss the agencies and services that can help them.

This could include relationship counselling or putting them in touch with organisations such as Alcoholics Anonymous or Shelter.

The Navigator scheme is the first to be available for anyone being treated in an accident and emergency department.

But a charity in London called Redthread has been running hospital-based violence intervention programmes specifically for young people for the past 11 years

'No violent o'clock'

Doctors at the GRI said the project was one of the most important innovations they had seen in decades.

They hope the scheme can be rolled out to A&E departments across Scotland.

Senior consultant, Donogh Maguire, said it was possibly the most valuable non-medical change in the management of A&E in the whole course of his career.

Image copyright Violence Reduction Unit Image caption Navigators Tam Begbie and Alan Gilmour have been working at the hospital since December

""I think for inner-city hospitals, this should be a standard means of engaging with the homeless and disenfranchised people that we have coming to our departments,"" he said.

""The reason I say this is because the current mechanisms are failing or the people are not engaging with them, whereas here we're getting the navigators catching people at a time when they're amenable to some intervention.""

One of the navigators, Alan Gilmour, said the work was highly unpredictable.

""We don't know what's coming in, we don't know what's happening,"" he said.

""I mean, there's no 'violent o'clock'. We begin our shift and we just wait or find out if there's anyone in and if there's not we wait around for that to happen.""

By James Shaw, BBC Scotland

It's after 10pm on a Thursday in the accident and emergency department at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Tam Begbie is sitting on the hard vinyl floor talking to a young woman with peroxide blonde hair slumped in a chair in front of him.

In the hubbub of an A&E starting to get busier as the night goes on, no-one else can hear the substance of their conversation. But that is as it should be.

Tam is not talking to the woman to explain her treatment or to find out if she's committed a crime. He is simply trying to help. Because as a navigator, that is his job.

The agencies behind this scheme are Police Scotland's Violence Reduction Unit and the doctors' group, Medics Against Violence.

They decided on the job title, navigator, because it describes the aim of the role, which is to help people steer their way through the agencies that might be able to help them escape the lifestyles that are making them victims and possibly perpetrators of violence.

Tam discovers the young woman with the broken wrist got the injury in a fall. It might have happened during an argument with her boyfriend.

He is now in the reception area, wanting to see her. Tam might decide that it is not safe for them to get together at this point.

'Transformative effect'

But he will advise the young woman that he can meet her to talk about her situation tomorrow or the day after. Maybe in a cafe or fast food restaurant - wherever she feels comfortable.

He will suggest places where she might seek help. It might be relationship counselling or Alcoholics Anonymous. Or Shelter if she needs to find somewhere new to live to escape an abusive relationship.

The genius of the navigator concept is that it offers help to people in the direst need at exactly the time when they might be most ready to make a change.

And it recognises that doctors and police officers cannot always offer permanent solutions to deep-rooted problems.

The value of the scheme is fully acknowledged by the head of A&E at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Alastair Ireland. He allowed the navigators in last December and has seen the difference they can make.

At the moment, this is just a small pilot scheme, but doctors at the GRI agree that having navigators in every A&E in Scotland could have a transformative effect on the problems of violence they and the rest of society have to deal with.","['navigators', 'introduced', 'woman', 'young', 'navigator', 'reduction', 'unit', 'scheme', 'help', 'violence', 'tackle', 'glasgow', 'ae']","Image copyright Violence Reduction UnitA project to tackle violence in A&E departments, thought to be the first of its kind in the UK, has been introduced in Glasgow.

Running changed former British soldier's life,Gary Edwards wants to inspire others and helped set up a weekly free 5km running event.,,None,"Image copyright Great Run Local Image caption Gary Edwards said turning to running was ""probably the best thing I could have done""

A former soldier who turned to alcohol, piled on the pounds and then shed 12 stone (76kg) has said he wants to inspire others to take up running.

Gary Edwards, 52, was medically discharged from the Army after a truck crash in Germany in 1992.

He suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and his weight increased to 25 stone (159kg).

He used running to get his life ""back on track"" and has helped set up a new fun run at Alton Water, in Suffolk.

Mr Edwards had served in the Royal Corps of Signals for 10 years when the crash happened, which left him with crush injuries to his legs and abdomen, which required part of his intestine to be removed.

Shortly after losing his military career, his son Christopher died from a brain haemorrhage.

He said he ""fell apart mentally and physically"" and turned to alcohol to ""numb the pain"".

Image copyright Family Photo Image caption Mr Edwards said he turned to alcohol to ""numb the pain"" and saw his weight grow to 25 stone

Mr Edwards, who has two daughters, attended an alcoholics anonymous meeting six years ago, decided his life had to change and he started running.

He said turning to running was ""probably the best thing I could have done"".

Following a trial period at Holbrook Academy, Mr Edwards, of Shotley Gate near Ipswich, has now helped to set up and lead the new free 5km (3.1-mile) Great Run Local Alton Water.

He said: ""Quitting the booze also meant that I started losing weight.

""I was now wanting to get fitter and healthier and to become the man, the dad and the husband I wanted to be.""

State must 'go further' to help addicts,"The state should do more to help addicts and make them employable, Iain Duncan Smith says, with removing benefits a ""hypothetical"" option.",,None,"Image copyright SPL Image caption Some say withdrawing benefits from drug users would lead them into crime

The state should intervene further to help drug and alcohol addicts recover and make them employable in future, a senior cabinet minister has said.

In a speech to Alcoholics Anonymous, Iain Duncan Smith argued that addicts who are unable to work are being let down by the welfare system.

The BBC understands removing benefits from people refusing treatment will be an option but a ""hypothetical"" one.

One drug charity said such a move would set a ""dangerous precedent"".

In 2010, the Home Office considered plans to remove benefits from addicts who refused treatment as part of the government's drug strategy but these were not pursued.

According to the Department for Work and Pensions, 40,000 people claim incapacity benefits - citing alcoholism as their primary condition. Of these, about a third have been claiming for more than a decade.

The government also says 80% of the UK's 400,000 ""problem drug users"" are claiming out-of-work benefits.

'Road to recovery'

In a speech in Parliament, Mr Duncan Smith said ""the outdated benefits system fails to get people off drugs and put their lives on track"".

""We have started changing how addicts are supported but we must go further to actively take on the devastation that drugs and alcohol can cause.

""We want to do more to encourage and support claimants into rehabilitation for addiction and starting them on the road to recovery and eventually work.""

There is no evidence that using the stick of benefit sanctions will help people to positively engage with treatment and support their recovery Martin Barnes, DrugScope

Mr Duncan Smith said the introduction of a single, consolidated benefit known as Universal Credit from next year - more details of which will be published on Thursday - will simplify the benefits system and provide more financial incentives for employment, helping all claimants.

""Getting people into work and encouraging independence is our ultimate goal,"" he added.

""Universal Credit will put people on a journey towards sustainable recovery so they are better placed to look for work in future.""

The BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason said Mr Duncan Smith, in his speech, hinted that a lack of willingness to seek help for addictions could lead to a cut in benefits.

But a source close to the minister emphasised that the universal credit would make it easier to ""track people through the system"" and ensure they get the help they need.

""Hypothetically people could lose benefits,"" the source told the BBC. ""You do have to have sanctions. But very few people refuse treatment.""

'No evidence'

Charities said many addicts were not receiving the support they needed at job centres and through the government's flagship welfare-to-work programme.

One of these, DrugScope, said it would be asking ministers to ""clarify"" their position on sanctions for refusing treatment.

""We are surprised and concerned at reports that ministers believe that stopping benefits is an appropriate or effective way of engaging people with drug or alcohol treatment and supporting their recovery,"" said its chief executive Martin Barnes

""If accurate, this would be a reversal of the government's publicly stated position.""

It said ministers had dropped plans, proposed by the previous Labour government, to require all those attending job centres to answer questions about possible drug and alcohol use.

""There is no evidence that using the stick of benefit sanctions will help people to positively engage with treatment and support their recovery,"" Mr Barnes added.

""Indeed, the risk is that people will disengage from support services, potentially worsening their dependency and the impacts on their families and communities. Linking benefit to a requirement to undergo treatment would set a dangerous precedent for people with physical or mental health problems.""

All those claiming employment and support allowance - which has replaced incapacity benefit - are currently being re-assessed under plans aimed at getting more people into work and reducing the welfare bill.

The death of Amy Winehouse has once again highlighted the danger of drink and drug addiction. Mitch and Janis Winehouse's battles to cure their daughter of her addiction are shared by thousands of parents up and down the country.

Many parents reading of the death at the weekend of singer Amy Winehouse will have thought to themselves: ""What would I do if my son or daughter was an addict?""

Some people, like Tom Methven, know only too well what they would do and whether it would work.

His son, Jason, 29, is an alcoholic.

Mr Methven, from Surrey, said: ""When I heard about Amy Winehouse I thought, 'It's finally got her'.

'Slave to the addiction'

""Drugs and alcohol damage a receptor in the brain. You become a slave. Why else would she have kept taking it? She was a very similar age to my son.""

Hannah Meredith was 17 when she died of a heroin overdose in October 2009.

Image caption Teenager Hannah Meredith wrote a ""letter to heroin"" a month before her death in 2009

A month before she died, she wrote a ""letter to heroin"". Her aunt, Lisa Moore, read out excerpts from the letter on BBC Radio Five Live last year.

Ms Moore told the BBC: ""It takes years to recover but it only takes seconds to relapse.""

She said: ""We heard about Amy Winehouse's death on Saturday and it brought back feelings of what happened to Hannah. It was two years ago, but it's still raw.""

Ms Moore said: ""I've read stuff on Facebook about Amy like 'one less junkie', and it is so ignorant and insensitive. Families feel helpless, they feel like failures, they think, 'How can we fix it when that person is choosing to do it'?""

""What people don't realise is that no matter how badly someone is on drugs nothing ever prepares you for the knock on the door or the phone call, nothing prepares you for their death.""

She said Hannah had been given an ecstasy tablet on her 14th birthday, ""liked the feeling"" and by the age of 15 was on heroin.

Two years later she was ""clean"" but then had her fatal relapse.

""She had been in recovery for four months and was sure she was in control of heroin. She might have thought she would try it one more time,"" said Ms Moore.

Both Ms Moore and Mr Methven said there was a lot of ignorance about substance abuse.

Tough love

They said many people thought they could just lock their son or daughter in a room and make them go ""cold turkey"" - completely denying them drink or drugs - to exorcise their demons.

The cold turkey scene has cropped up in films like Trainspotting and soap operas like EastEnders, where a parent uses so-called ""tough love"".

But Mr Methven says the reality is that it very rarely works.

He has tried almost everything to rescue his son from his alcoholism:

Rehab - two sessions in a £500-a-day private clinic.

Medication - Antabuse, or disulfiram, a tablet which makes the taker sick if he or she drinks alcohol.

Sectioning - a compulsory week in a mental health unit.

Psychiatry - several sessions with a top specialist.

Image caption Mitch and Janis Winehouse had to deal with their daughter's addiction amid the public's gaze

At his worst point Jason, who weighs 19 stone (120kg), was drinking huge quantities of vodka and would become violent and aggressive.

""One time he smashed a piece of glass at his girlfriend's house and cut an artery. I had to follow the trail of blood to find him. They broke up about a month later. She couldn't cope with it,"" said Mr Methven.

He said: ""Another time he was self-harming. He burned himself with an iron and was then banging his head against a table.

""He tried to cut his wrists once with a knife. The police were called and he was taken to hospital.

""He was so drunk he was fighting with the security guards and he got one of them, a big guy, on the floor. Eventually he was given a very strong tranquilliser.""

Mr Methven said his son, who is an only child, had a normal childhood and was very intelligent.

He went to university and got a first with honours before embarking on a PhD.

Out of control

But his drinking, which had started as a teenager, got out of control and he never completed it.

Jason is now unemployed and gets £20 a week in Disability Living Allowance.

""That is supposed to be given to his mum for laundry and shopping but it is in many respects money for alcohol,"" said his father.

Mr Methven said: ""He was about 24 when we realised he had a real problem. We went to the doctor and got a referral.

""We wanted to get him into rehab but it took so long on the NHS that we panicked and went private.""

Jason has been into rehab twice.

There is no alcohol in the house now. I used to have some good quality wine. It was very well hid. I was going to give it to a friend as a present but it was gone. He had drunk it John Methven, Father of an alcoholic

On one occasion Mr Methven spent £18,000 and he said: ""Before the cheque was even dry he was back on the drink.""

He said: ""There is no alcohol in the house now. I used to have some good-quality wine. It was very well hid. I was going to give it to a friend as a present but it was gone. He had drunk it.""

Mr Methven said his son had stolen money from him and his wife and had also taken DVDs and other property and sold it at cash converter shops to provide drinking money.

'Secretive' drinking

""It's always secretive drinking. He doesn't go to the pub. He just drinks in his room. He hid it in rucksacks or under the hedge in the garden,"" he said.

Jason has now joined Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and has a sponsor, but he is still drinking.

""He is trying to take it down. Yesterday he had six cans (of beer) and today it's four. He is still drinking but it's far less,"" said Mr Methven.

But he said the crucial thing was that Jason has now said he wants to stop.

Image caption Nicholas Mills (pictured) hanged himself after a drug-fuelled argument but his twin brother survived and is now clean

""If they are going to get well they have got to go to AA or NA (Narcotics Anonymous). The individual is powerless, but collectively they can do it. It's a spiritual thing. AA is about giving it up altogether.

""Once you are an alcoholic or an addict one is too many and 100 is not enough.""

Asked how he feels about his son now, he said: ""It's not so much shame as disappointment about what he could have done with his life.""

While Mr Methven can understand the addiction, Elizabeth Burton-Phillips knows the heartbreak of what she calls the ""double whammy"" of addiction and death.

Her twin sons, Nicholas and Simon, both became heroin addicts.

Nicholas died in 2004 but Simon survived and has kicked the habit.

Mrs Burton-Phillips, from Buckinghamshire, has since set up a charity, DrugFam, and she told the BBC: ""We are trying to help families who are struggling to cope with the addiction of their loved ones, like Amy and my son.""

She said she met Amy's mother in 2008 and added: ""I have been in text contact with her since Amy passed and they are obviously going to be terribly badly affected.""

Mrs Burton-Phillips travelled to Llanelli on Monday to give her moral support to the Hannah Meredith Foundation, which launched a support group for the families of those in the Carmarthenshire area coping with substance abuse.

Anyone wanting to contact the foundation should do so through their Facebook page.

Actress Sadie Frost has told the High Court that having her phone hacked by Mirror Group journalists made her life a ""living hell"".

Describing the experience as the ""lowest of the low"", the 49-year-old actress and businesswoman said she did not know who to trust.

In 2003, she had a breakdown and went into hospital, which was a ""terrible"" incident but ended up in the papers.

Ms Frost is among eight high-profile figures claiming damages for hacking.

She told the court: ""Your father is dying, you are going through divorce, you have postnatal depression, you are in and out of hospital, my baby was ill, he was born premature.

""I was at breaking point, I could not sleep, or eat, and I did not know who to trust as information kept getting into the media.

""I needed my loved ones around me. I was very upset, I was a very, very unhappy person.

""Every time I turned to someone to confide in them, it ended up in the newspapers, which added to my distress and trauma.""

""I couldn't go and sit with my mum and have a cup of tea because I thought she was selling stories. I didn't trust my own mother.""

Ms Frost said her separation from fellow actor Jude Law was very difficult.

""I thought it might be Jude, trying to make me look bad for custody reasons, or my friends or family using me for their own gains. Either thought was heartbreaking.

""This was a deeply stressful time in my life and the fact my insecurities were being publicised obviously made it worse.""

She described how friends, particularly model Kate Moss, questioned whether they could trust her.

""Even worse than that, Jude, the father of my children, thought for years that I was selling stories which created an animosity between us that has only really disappeared since the revelations about phone hacking.""

Ms Frost said: ""I couldn't take my youngest son to the park for two years because he was photographed. He would cry and I would get panic attacks.

""I lost two to three years of my life, they wanted me to fail.

She told the hearing that it felt like she and those closest to her were ""being monitored and hunted down by a sort of secret police"".

""Every area of my life was affected. There was nowhere I could go that was safe.""

""If I went to the doctor or gynaecologist, details would be in the newspaper.""

'Embarrassed and humiliated'

Ms Frost said she was left ""incredibly embarrassed and humiliated"" when a story emerged about her attending an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

She said she had been advised to go a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous ""because it was a safe place"".

""Someone quite high-profile took me there and I went there after everyone said it would be safe and anonymous,"" she told the court.

""I was portrayed as troubled, sad, as a party-girl. That's not why people go to AA, they go there to get help and be in a safe place.""

She added: ""I was portrayed for so long as a complete mess that I have had to overcome people's perception of me to rebuild my reputation as a successful businesswoman. I can only guess at the position I would be in if none of this had happened.""

She said that the apology she had received from Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) was ""rather too little too late"".

The hearing at the High Court in London is considering what compensation should be paid by MGN to Ms Frost, alongside BBC creative director Alan Yentob, soap stars Shane Richie, Shobna Gulati and Lucy Taggart, former footballer Paul Gascoigne, TV producer Robert Ashworth and flight attendant Lauren Alcorn.","['hacking', 'caused', 'jude', 'mirror', 'life', 'hell', 'safe', 'frost', 'trust', 'told', 'went', 'living', 'thought', 'court', 'sadie']","Image copyright BBC Sport Image caption Frost said hacking by Mirror journalists affected her relationship with fellow actor Jude LawActress Sadie Frost has told the High Court that having her phone hacked by Mirror Group journalists made her life a ""living hell"".

Boy George has become a patron of Focus 12, the drug and alcohol rehabilitation charity based in Suffolk.

The singer and DJ said he wanted to spread the word that help is available for people who are struggling with addiction, and to their families.

""The important thing is for people to know there is a way out of it - there's Focus 12, NA (Narcotics Anonymous) and AA (Alcoholics Anonymous),"" he said.

Russell Brand and Davina McCall are also patrons of Focus 12.

Bury St Edmunds-based Focus 12 chief executive Chip Somers said 19 drug and alcohol rehabilitation charities had closed in the UK in the past 20 months.

He said the support and publicity provided by the patrons had kept Focus 12 running.

Boy George, whose real name is George O'Dowd, made his name with Culture Club and has himself battled with drug addiction.

""It did used to be something that was associated with music and celebrities, but nowadays it's so widespread,"" he said.

""One of the great things about Focus 12 is that it concentrates on the whole family, because it is a family disease.

9/11: The 73 minutes that changed my life,"Like thousands of others, Artie Van Why saw the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York from the streets below. What he witnessed in those minutes has changed his life in a profound way and will, he believes, continue to affect him until the day he dies.",,None,"Like thousands of other New Yorkers, Artie Van Why saw the attacks on the World Trade Center from the streets below. What he witnessed in those minutes changed his life profoundly and will, he believes, continue to haunt him until the day he dies.

The moment he walked through the revolving doors of his office building and stepped on to the street on that sunny September morning, Artie Van Why's world shifted a few degrees on its axis.

It was like the Wizard of Oz, stepping into another world

His life from that instant took a different course, propelled by the mayhem that enveloped him that day, events the world later identified by two numbers, nine and 11.

Millions of people watched on television as four hijacked planes crashed in the US, two of them into one famous New York landmark. But Van Why was in the thick of it.

The experience forced him to leave New York, his home for 26 years, and move more than 100 miles west to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, deep in Amish country.

Ten years after the atrocities, sitting in the corner of a humble one-bedroom apartment located above a funeral home, his face is a picture of concentration as he recalls the day's events.

""I remember it was a beautiful day. Whenever I see a really beautiful blue sky, it takes me back to that morning.""

He was working as a clerical assistant at law firm Holland & Knight, and his office was on the 23rd floor of a building separated from the World Trade Center site only by Church Street and the Millennium Hilton hotel. At 08:46, a loud boom shook the building.

A colleague asked if it was thunder, then someone screamed for everyone to get out of the building, because a plane had hit one of the twin towers. Expecting to see a small aircraft sticking out of the famous skyscraper, Van Why took the lift to the ground floor and exited through a revolving door.

""It was like the Wizard of Oz, stepping into another world. It seemed as everything slowed down and it was going frame by frame as if in slow motion.

""All these white paper sheets were covering the ground like snow and coming down. I remember thinking that I'd never seen so much paper.

""I walked a short distance to Church Street where the towers were and that's when I saw the North Tower for the first time. I was dumbstruck. It was hard to comprehend what I was seeing.

""There was a huge black hole, the flames were bright orange and the smoke was billowing out of the tower.""

More people were arriving on the streets, he says, and sirens could be heard in the background. As his recollections become more vivid, the 58-year-old closes his eyes and rocks back and forth in his orange armchair, his right foot tapping the carpet vigorously.

His rented apartment is full of reminders of what he went through. A photo of the World Trade Center is on the fridge, and other photographs featuring the famous Manhattan skyline adorn the living room, like pictures of a deceased member of the family.

Image caption Reminders of the life left behind fill his apartment

One wall is full of framed newspaper cuttings, reviews of the play that Van Why - a former actor - wrote and performed about 9/11. And in front of this shrine, he sits and recalls the minutes that reshaped his life, wild hand gestures making the scene all the more real.

""I don't know how long I was looking at the North Tower, trying to take it all in. I was transfixed. What broke it was when I realised there were other things falling, there were people falling and everyone realised at the same time.

""People started screaming and my reaction was to scream 'No, No, No!' at the thought that people were falling down. And that's when - I don't know why I reacted in this way - but my instinct was to run towards them.

I remember shouting out 'God, save us all!

""I ran to the plaza where they were falling. I didn't have a moment's thought, I just ran towards the tower, thinking 'Can I help these people?' I imagined them laying there and the thought of being able to hold their hand or sit and be with them, comfort them.""

Another man was running with him, and for a moment, the two stopped and stood side by side, taking in the enormity of what they were seeing - human beings jumping to their deaths. Van Why recalls seeing bodies piling up on the ground.

""One of my most vivid memories is looking to my left and I saw this man in a suit falling. Somehow I had thought that if you ever jumped from a high place, you would be dead before you hit the ground.

""But I remember seeing how very much alive he was and I can still see his arms and legs moving as if to brace himself. Fortunately I didn't see him hit.""

Some guards shouted for the two men to come to safety through another World Trade Center Building, number 5. They went down a lift and out of the site on to Church Street, from where Van Why saw the second plane hit the South Tower, only 17 minutes after the first.

Pandemonium broke out. Debris was raining down, he says, as he ran towards Fulton Street, at one point falling to the ground.

""People started to run over the top of me and I thought I was going to be trampled to death but I managed to get up. I remember shouting out 'God, save us all!'""

He recalls an African-American woman tripping and being helped to her feet by a businessman. Then he ran past a large man who was lying face down in the street.

Getting down on his knees, Van Why saw that the man had a serious head injury. He appeared to have been hit by a putty knife that had fallen from one of the buildings and was lying nearby stained with blood.

""Another man stopped and gave me a denim jacket which we put over the open wound and then I remember seeing his watch on the street beside him and I put it in his pants [trouser] pocket. We turned him over and he had a work tag with a name.""

With tears falling and his voice cracking, Van Why goes on: ""My biggest regret is that I didn't look to his tag to see what the name was. I could have found his family and told them that there were people with him.""

An ambulance arrived and it required several people to lift the man on to the stretcher. Van Why stroked his arm and told him he would be fine.

Realising he had left his mobile phone in the office, he began asking strangers if he could borrow one to get the message through to his parents that he was OK. But none of the phones were working, so he went into a cafe and used a telephone there.

When he emerged, he heard a deafening sound. He looked to his left and saw a wall of grey smoke coming towards him. The South Tower was collapsing.

For the second time that morning, he started running. The time was 09:59, 73 minutes after the first plane flew into the North Tower.

By the time he got to his apartment on 43rd Street, after deliberately avoiding the area around the Empire State Building, it was approaching noon. The North Tower had also collapsed, but Van Why had been far enough away to not hear it.

In the days that followed, he slept only fitfully and always with the bedroom light on.

""I was afraid of the dark. It never happened before 9/11. It was a sense of security having that light on.

""For that first week I would wake up early and call my parents first thing. I would be on the phone crying with them. There was a lot of crying that week.

""I was feeling sadness and grief and mourning like I had never felt, similar to losing a loved one. And still an incomprehension, trying to understand what had happened.""

He avoided watching television or reading newspapers because he could not bear to see replays or photos of the planes striking the towers. He had his own images, pictures inside his head, sometimes appearing with a clarity that transported him back to the mayhem.

He discovered that two men who lived in his apartment building were missing and a lawyer at work who was last seen running towards the towers was also presumed dead.

Van Why had done exactly the same and survived. As a recovering alcoholic who had been sober for two years, he already had a therapist, and in the weeks following 9/11 he saw him daily.

Alcoholics Anonymous meetings were also an opportunity to share his feelings with others, but he lived alone and had no partner to provide constant support. Before long he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

Holland & Knight opened makeshift offices at a hotel in Midtown but he did not feel able to go back to work until two or three weeks after the attacks. When he did, it was the first time he had ventured outside his neighbourhood.

A few days later, he rented a car and drove to Maryland, for a 30-year high school reunion. The sight of an aeroplane coming into land caused him to burst into tears. At the event, when he introduced himself by saying: ""I'm from the greatest city in the world, New York City,"" people stood up and applauded.

His old offices near Ground Zero were soon ready again, but Van Why found returning to the scene too harrowing to endure. The smell of smoke from the still-smouldering site would fill his nostrils as he emerged from the subway.

The WTC plaza - once his lunchtime sanctuary - now resembled to him a grave. One morning, the police allowed him to enter the site so he could lay six roses on what he regarded as ""hallowed ground"".

In November 2001, he resigned from work after 13 years of service. It was too painful to continue. He instead focused on his new project - writing his own story about his experience.

I was out of the country and didn't get back to New York City until the end of October. I was in touch with Artie, aware of his proximity, but didn't fully understand the impact on him until I got home. It was unravelling. It could only be unravelling. No-one should have to witness something like that. In survival mode, he knew he no longer could stay in NYC. His family, which had always been a strong connection in his life, would provide a sense of comfort and familiarity he desperately needed. He moved out of the city and regrouped. It took time. Through his grief and pain he also found a creative outlet. He was able to process his grief by writing about it.

He had written emails to family and friends following the attacks, to explain what happened, and they forwarded his story to other people. Soon he began to receive appreciative emails from strangers.

Encouraged, he began to develop his story into a script, convinced it was his mission to keep the memory alive. It became a one-man play that he performed off-Broadway and in Los Angeles.

""The play gave me a sense of purpose. Those two years after 9/11, when I was really focused on my play, that is the only time in my life I felt fulfilled, because I had a purpose and I thought I was doing something important and something selfless, because I was doing it for the memory of the people I saw die.""

After each performance, some people would tell him their own story of where they were, making him realise, he says, that people across the US had a story of 9/11.

He was hoping he could continue performing the show for at least five years.

""I wanted to dedicate my life to it. But it closed in New York earlier than planned, the major papers ignored it and some reviews were critical, saying I was trying to profit out of it.""

It seemed to him like the city was ready to move on and he was not. The spirit that defined New York in the days, weeks and months afterwards had gone, he says, and he felt a bit like a ""lone crusader"".

Image caption Van Why performed his play in 2003

""It still weighed so heavily on my emotions and who I was, so to see other people weren't doing that and moving on, it was like 'How can they be doing that?'

""There was anger and a feeling of isolation. In the month after 9/11, it was all you talked about with strangers, but two years afterwards, there was a sense that 'OK, you don't need to talk about this any more.'""

Immersing himself for years in writing and performing the play probably held him back, he admits, because he was dwelling on the events and re-living them, but not dealing with the emotions.

That process did not begin until he moved. In September 2003, he started a new life in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, because he wanted to be near his parents.

""I never thought I would leave New York, I envisaged my last days would be in New York but it just seemed like the right thing to do.""

He felt guilty about leaving, but the pull of family was overwhelming and he felt like he had nowhere else to go.

""All of a sudden I just needed to be closer to them, I wanted it and needed it. For me and my parents, the reality that 9/11 was a day that I could have died brought the importance of being with my family to me.

""Though I was in my 50s, there was a sense that I needed mummy and daddy, that sense of security and that sense of home.""

Growing up, home was Gaithersburg in Maryland, where the young Van Why was a quiet boy, according to his parents.

Thelma and Art Van Why His parents endured a terrifying few hours on 11 Sept 2001 while they waited for news

Relief at hearing he was OK turned to despair as they watched their son spiral into depression

But in 2003, he moved to be near to them both

""We're so happy that he's moved because we became closer. It's a big change,"" says Thelma. ""But to see your own child go through that, you wonder what you can do to help.""

""He was in his own little shell, his own little world and we would try to comfort him as much as we could,"" says Art. ""We just told him we were here for him. So it's really helped me to know he's starting to come round.""

He says he felt different from other children - he later realised he was gay - and was bullied.

After high school, he attended a small, conservative Christian college, where he majored first in Bible studies, then in drama.

He moved to New York in 1977 with the dream of becoming an actor but after struggling for 10 years to get sustained work in the theatre, he gave it up. The clerical work that had been a supplement to his income became his main and only job.

As a young man, he'd had a difficult relationship with his parents and throughout his adult life he had seen them only three or four times a year. It was not until he moved to Pennsylvania, two years after the attacks, that his relationship with them, in his own words, ""fully healed"".

""I didn't know what it would entail, moving here, but eight years later, my relationship with my parents is incredible. It has a depth and appreciation it has never had before.""

When he arrived in 2003, he didn't have a job, an apartment or a car, and he left many long-standing friendships behind in New York. And there was no-one who could relate to what he had been through.

After the bright lights of Manhattan, the small city of Lancaster - with fewer than 60,000 residents and a homespun, rural charm - struck a tranquil note.

Van Why withdrew socially, spending a lot of time in what he calls his ""cave"", a room where he would just watch television endlessly at weekends. Even when he was coaxed out of his isolation by colleagues for a coffee, he was lost and distracted.

A low period at the end of last year, when he was often breaking down, was his grief finally being released, he believes.

""I was very fortunate I did not lose my physical life but I lost my life as I knew it. The person I was on September 10th, that person is no longer. I had to go through a very emotional period which enabled me to go and face Ground Zero.""

In the last few months he has started to come out of his metaphorical cave. The first step on the road to recovery was going back to New York in April, for the first time since he left in 2003. With his parents and sister Sue by his side, he visited the place that had haunted him for nearly a decade.

""That was a huge step for me. It was very emotional but it helped to put an end to that chapter of my life. Even though I had been away for eight years, there was guilt that I had left my city when it was still healing.""

Only having closed that door, could he start to regard Lancaster as home, he says. Shortly after that trip, he met someone and began a relationship.

""Being with him, I realised that I had forgotten what it was like to be happy. It's like I am stepping back into life. I'm finally moving past mourning.""

But there are other struggles. He has two jobs, one in the box office of the Fulton Theatre in Lancaster, and another as a cashier in a Weis supermarket. The two incomes combined earn him about $20,000 (£12,196) a year, about $50,000 (£30,494) less than he was earning in New York.

'I witnessed the goodness of man' ""I don't believe I had witnessed the wrath of anyone's God that morning. What I had been a witness to when I looked up at those burning towers was the ultimate evil that man is capable of. The evidence of just how deep hatred could run, how far it could go. But I had also been a witness to something else that day - down on the ground. I witnessed the ultimate goodness of man, the evidence of how strong courage could be, to what lengths it would go. I believe God was in the hands of everyone who reached out to someone else. He was in the arms of people on the streets as they embraced one another. He was in the tears of strangers who cried together. He was in all the lives that were given in the line of duty, in the acts of heroism. He was in the hearts of the people across the country who, as they watched the horror from afar, felt compassion."" That Day In September

It's a thorn in his side, he says. ""I have debts and try to pay them off when I can and meet my basic expenses. So far, I've been lucky to just get by.""

If he had been told in 2001 that in 10 years he would be living in Pennsylvania and working in a theatre and a supermarket, he would have been shocked.

""I liked my job. I liked working down there. And, yes, I was making a good salary. I would like to think I might have developed a relationship with someone.

""At the time of 9/11, I was in the best place I had been for a long time - sober and happy. Perhaps I would have been able to take vacations and travel, things I'm unable to do now.""

And the images are still there every day, sometimes popping into his head without warning, with such force that he zones out while his mind revisits the carnage.

""They are like snippets of a movie. I will replay watching this one man who I saw falling, watching him. I will flash to the injured man I saw laying in the streets. It's a series of vignettes that my mind just goes back to.""

A siren is enough to take him back there and it's a sound that makes his body tighten. He still has not boarded a plane, although tall buildings don't instil in him the same fear they once did.

A study by Cornell University suggests that the trauma suffered by witnesses like Van Why may have physically altered their brains, damaging their ability to process emotions.

He says 9/11 survivors and witnesses like himself are the ""forgotten majority"", never considered among the victims.

What I was doing for a long time was letting 9/11 define who I was

""They're not letting any survivors to the [10th anniversary] ceremony in New York, it's just bereaved family members.

""There's a sense that you don't count. Some people are still struggling terribly, far worse than I am. Everyone who was there is still affected to a degree, but people don't remember us.

""We're not suffering physically and weren't injured that day and didn't lose a family member. It's like we don't count.""

Despite the financial and mental strains, he is now looking to the future with a new optimism.

""It's my life now and I've never accepted that before. That's another change in the past months. Not that I was fighting it before, but there's an acceptance, I'm moving out of the mourning stage and back to life again.""

It's comparable to losing a partner, he says, with the memory of that loved one never disappearing but gradually losing its hold.

""I can't imagine a day going by when I don't think about it, even as a passing thought.

""What I was doing for a long time was letting 9/11 define who I was and I think I'm getting away from that now. My experience of 9/11 is part of who I am but not all of me.""

The headstones with unusual stories to tell,A tour around the interesting stories found lurking in English graveyards.,,None,"Image copyright Getty Images

Cemeteries offer a heady mix of history, beauty, nature and death to those who enjoy browsing around them. Burial grounds such as Highgate in north London, which host the graves of the rich and famous, draw thousands of visitors. But there are scores of other less well known but interesting graves around England.

The barmaid who taunted a tiger

Image copyright Getty Images

In 1703, Hannah Twynnoy became Britain's first recorded victim of a tiger.

She was a barmaid at the White Lion in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, when a travelling menagerie set up in the pub's large rear yard, ready to attract paying crowds.

Hannah was warned against upsetting the tiger but she enjoyed bothering and poking at the big cat - until one day it discovered the cage door was open. Fed up of the pesky barmaid, the tiger launched itself on the unfortunate servant and mauled her to death.

The stone, in Malmesbury Abbey has the epitaph:

In bloom of life

She's snatched from hence

She had not room to make defence;

For Tyger fierce

Took life away

And here she lies

In a bed of clay

Until the Resurrection Day.

The diver who saved a cathedral

Image copyright FindaGrave/Getty Images

William Walker was a deep-sea diver who, in 1905, was employed to help repair the foundations of Winchester Cathedral.

Large cracks had appeared in the cathedral's walls and vaulted ceilings, some of which were wide enough for owls to roost in.

Because Winchester has a high underlying water table and the cathedral is built on peaty soil, trenches dug below filled with water before any reinforcing work could be done.

So Walker, who usually worked at Portsmouth dockyard, was recruited.

A tunnel was excavated beneath the building and for six years he spent nearly six hours a day underwater, in darkness, replacing and shoring up the foundations with his bare hands. He worked entirely by touch. Eventually he propped the cathedral up with 900,000 bricks, 114,900 concrete blocks and 25,800 bags of cement.

Because it took him so long to put on and take off his heavy diving suit, when he stopped for a break he would just take off his helmet in order to eat his lunch and smoke his pipe.

As if that was not enough effort, each weekend he cycled 150 miles - home to Croydon, south London, before returning to work on Monday.

He died aged 49 during the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918. His grave, at Beckenham Cemetery in Bromley, south-east London, bears the words: ""The diver who with his own hands saved Winchester Cathedral.""

The soldier whose beer was too weak

In Winchester, there is a grave which pays homage to a 26-year-old grenadier in the North Regiment of the Hants Militia. Thomas Thetcher died after drinking contaminated small (weak) beer when he was hot.

Before the invention of modern sanitation, people would drink small beer when fresh water was unavailable. This was because the alcohol was toxic to water-borne pathogens.

However, it was not enough to prevent Thetcher catching a fever and dying.

Following his death in 1764, his comrades arranged for a jocular headstone inscription warning of the dangers of drink. It read:

Here sleeps in peace a Hampshire Grenadier,

Who caught his death by drinking cold small beer,

Soldiers be wise from his untimely fall

And when ye're hot drink strong or none at all.

In 1918, the tombstone caught the attention of a young American soldier called Bill Wilson, who was camped nearby with his US Army unit.

Twenty-one years later, following a battle with alcoholism, he founded Alcoholics Anonymous and in 1939 published a book about his experience.

In it he claimed the gravestone had been an ""ominous warning which I failed to heed"", and printed the first two lines of the verse in the front of his book.

However, it appears he misunderstood the headstone, as he missed out the crucial advice about only drinking strong beer.

On 12 May - the anniversary of Thetcher's death - people gather at the grave to drink (strong) beer and raise a glass to the grenadier.

Peter the Wild Boy

Image copyright Neale Monks/Historic Royal Palaces

Peter had been found living alone and naked in a German forest in 1725. He could not talk, and would scamper about on all fours rather than walk.

When he was about 12 he was brought to London by King George I where he became a ""human pet"" at Kensington Palace. However, his inability to learn table manners or speech, hatred of wearing clothes - even his specially-made green velvet suit - and lack of decorum led to him falling out of favour.

The court paid for him to retire to a Hertfordshire farm with a generous pension and when he died, aged about 72, the locals paid for a headstone. Even today, flowers are laid on his grave.

Peter's funeral was held at St Mary's Church, Northchurch, Hertfordshire, and was paid for by the government. His gravestone was provided by local people.

At the time, courtiers assumed Peter's behaviour was the result of being brought up by wolves or bears. However, modern analysis of a portrait suggests Peter had a rare genetic condition known as Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome.

The bleeding tombstone of Richard Smith

St Mary's Church in Hinckley, Leicestershire, is the last resting place of Richard Smith who was killed on 12 April 1727, aged 20.

Although his headstone is fairly run-of-the-mill, the story behind his death serves as an abject warning to young men with a fondness for messing about when they should be paying attention.

According to the local history club, a recruiting sergeant for the army had come to Hinckley and was singing the praises of taking the King's shilling. Richard, rather than listening, made jokes and quips until the recruiter lost his temper. In a slight overreaction, the soldier gave the crowd an unplanned demonstration in how to use a pike in close quarter combat - and killed Richard.

For years there were reports of the headstone appearing red and tradition held the gravestone sweated blood on the anniversary of the murder.

However, a more prosaic explanation was suggested by a researcher in 1936. The gravestone used to be positioned under a block of red sandstone and it was thought that the ""blood"" being sweated may have resulted in water dripping from this block.

The Woodplumpton Witch

Nestled among the neat headstones at St Anne's churchyard in Woodplumpton, near Preston, is a boulder marking the grave of Meg Shelton.

Known as ""the Fylde Hag"", she was accused of witchcraft in the late 17th Century. Allegations centred on the fairly tame ""stealing milk"" and the more-impressive ""turning herself into a animal"".

She was killed in mysterious circumstances when a barrel crushed her against the wall of her cottage.

Folklore has it she dug her way out of her grave on more than one occasion. She was eventually buried head down in a narrow shaft so that if she tried to claw her way out she would be heading in the wrong direction - and instead burrow her way to Hell.

The boulder was put on top as an extra way of keeping her anchored in the grave.

According to legend, if you walk three times around the boulder while chanting ""I don't believe in witches"", Meg's bony hand will rise from her grave and grasp your ankle.","['unusual', 'drink', 'london', 'death', 'way', 'tell', 'headstones', 'water', 'copyright', 'gravestone', 'winchester', 'grave', 'headstone']","Image copyright Getty ImagesCemeteries offer a heady mix of history, beauty, nature and death to those who enjoy browsing around them.

Former alcoholic 'scared' by rise in young drinkers,"A recovering alcoholic from Norfolk says he is ""scared"" by the rise in the number of young people with drink problems.",,None,"Image caption Recovering alcoholic Patrick Martin is 'scared' by the rise in the number of young drinkers

A recovering alcoholic from Norfolk says he is ""scared"" by the rise in the number of young people with drink problems at his support group.

Patrick Martin, 64, once drank a litre of vodka a day at the height of his alcohol addiction.

Mr Martin, who has been sober for three years, has lost two partners to alcohol-related illnesses.

Now he is worried by the rise in the number of young people at his Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

""We are getting more young people at meetings, particularly young women,"" he said.

""They are getting really ill through drinking and it scares me for future generations.

""My heart goes out to them. I wish I could tell them what I've been through.""

'Wallowed in sadness'

Mr Martin, who lives in Norwich, said he has seen a sharp rise in young people aged between 22 to 28 coming to the group.

I just locked the door, drew the curtains, pulled the telephone wire out and just wallowed in my own sadness Patrick Martin

Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show the rate of alcohol-related deaths for 15 to 34-year-olds in the UK has almost doubled in nearly 20 years.

In 1991, 137 young people aged between 15 and 34 died of alcohol-related problems. Of those, 48 were women.

By 2009, the total number of alcohol-related deaths had risen to 261, of which 94 were women.

""The stories we hear from these young people are harrowing to say the least,"" Mr Martin said.

""They let their hair down at weekends but these weekends tend to get out of hand for a lot of them.""

Mr Martin said his drink problem started to escalate in his late 20s, when he drank as a way to escape the pressure he felt in his work as a pottery designer.

At the height of his addiction, Mr Martin said would sometimes go without eating for two weeks when on a drinking binge.

""I just locked the door, drew the curtains, pulled the telephone wire out and just wallowed in my own sadness,"" he said.

""When you are drinking, your only thoughts from the moment you wake up until the moment you pass out is where you can get your next drink from. Nothing else matters.""

'Rock bottom'

Mr Martin said his alcohol problem has shortened his life and robbed him of his marriage and his relationship with his son.

Two former partners have also died of alcohol-related illnesses in the past six years, he added.

Despite attending Alcoholics Anonymous for almost 30 years, Mr Martin said he decided to stop drinking quite suddenly three-and-a-half years ago.

""I just put the drink down one day,"" he said. ""I had reached my rock bottom and climbed back up but a lot of people don't.""

Mr Martin, who has now retired for health reasons, is calling for better education to help stem the rising tide of young drinkers.

""You are not going to stop people drinking by putting alcohol prices up,"" he said.

""If you are desperate for alcohol, you will steal to get it.

""I don't think the health services or Government take the problem seriously enough or realise how serious it will be in a few years.

""If they carry on drinking, a lot of these young people will be in the same boat as me in 10 years time.""","['alcoholrelated', 'drink', 'scared', 'alcohol', 'young', 'drinkers', 'rise', 'drinking', 'number', 'mr', 'problem', 'martin', 'alcoholic']","Image caption Recovering alcoholic Patrick Martin is 'scared' by the rise in the number of young drinkersA recovering alcoholic from Norfolk says he is ""scared"" by the rise in the number of young people with drink problems at his support group.

Recovering Durham alcoholic starts blog to help others,A recovering alcoholic from Durham is sharing his experiences in beating his addiction in an online blog designed to help others.,,None,"Image caption Martin Prest drank 83 units in two days

A recovering alcoholic from Durham is sharing his thoughts and experiences in an online blog to help others beat the addiction.

Martin Prest has been sober for 18 months following his daily battle with drink for the past eight years.

He regularly used to drink about 18 pints a day.

He has now set up the informative blog, Open Alcoholic, to catalogue his experience battling alcohol addiction.

""I thought that alcoholism is so difficult sometimes to understand from the outside if you haven't lived it, and after speaking to people over my 18 months sobriety... family members or people who care about them, they can't necessarily understand,"" Mr Prest said.

""They've asked me what it's like and to try an explain this process, this mindset, that they've watched destroy someone and I really wanted to use the website to try and explain it better.""

My entire body was falling apart, I had nothing left in life but the drinking Martin Prest

The 26-year-old uses his blog to explain how he came to terms with his addiction and overcame it, but how it still troubles him.

Mr Prest unknowingly had his first taste of alcohol when he was just seven-years-old.

""It was funny because I didn't know it was alcoholic and I knew I wasn't allowed to drink it,"" he said.

""I started stealing sips of it in the morning when I was seven, it was on a top shelf on a cupboard and I could nip up and get it and have a sip, just because I liked the taste of it, I didn't know what it was or anything.""

Following this early taste his drinking habits became out of control from the age of 18 and he went from being a social drinker to drinking alone and getting drunk.

""I drank until I was drunk and could finally fall asleep, everyday for years. The only time I actually noted down how much I drank was my last weekend drinking,"" he said.

""I knew I was going to stop drinking, I was sort of saying farewell to it and I drank through 83 units in two days, I was drinking mostly bitters and real ale and that's 18 pints and I wasn't drunk - I could still walk straight and I was still holding conversations and stuff, I mean how much I drank when I did get drunk I have no idea, more than that.""

'Spontaneously haemorrhaging'

After years of destroying his body through drink, his health problems became visible.

""My entire body was falling apart, I had nothing left in life but the drinking,"" he said.

""I was spontaneously haemorrhaging, I was bleeding out of my face from the damage that was being done, my head was just exploding in pain constantly my body was just wrecked. I knew I had to stop drinking.""

Mike Scott, a GP in Newcastle, said: ""Liver disease can lose the blood's ability to clot, so therefore you tend to bleed more easily.

""A cut or damage to the skin is arguably going to bleed more with an unhealthy liver.""

Mr Prest, added: ""It's such an insane process because you lose everything and it ruins your life essentially, I mean I've obviously picked back up again but you still want to drink you still want to get drunk, it never ever goes away, it's just engrained in your personality.""

Schools in North Yorkshire are piloting a theatre scheme which aims to educate teenagers about the dangers of alcohol.

Harrogate has one of the highest levels of alcohol-related hospital admissions for under 18s in Yorkshire, according to the Centre for Public Health.

The play, by Bryan Bounds, is about the life of Bill Wilson the found of Alcoholics Anonymous.

Mr Bounds said the drama allowed students to learn about alcoholism and its destructive effects.

'Growing concern'

My Name is Bill, which is performed by Mr Bounds, the founder of the Leeds-based Amerrycan Theatre, was shown to critical praise at the Edinburgh Fringe and has been adapted for use in education.

Mr Bounds, himself a recovering alcoholic, said: ""I've watched with growing concern about how alcohol has become such a big issue for young people.

""A lot of alcohol education is quite patronising and condescending but students are very switched on, very sophisticated.""

The Centre for Public Health said Harrogate was second only to Wakefield in Yorkshire for alcohol-related hospital admissions for under 18s.

The drama is being shown to Year 12 students at Ashville College and St Aiden's School.

Marion Farrar, business liaison officer at St Aiden's School, said: ""I think young people see alcohol as a norm these days which is a worrying trend.

""It is becoming more and more what you do on a night out as a matter of rite.""","['drama', 'yorkshire', 'alcohol', 'theatre', 'young', 'bounds', 'public', 'drinking', 'students', 'st', 'schools', 'harrogate', 'tackle', 'shown', 'play', 'teenage']","Harrogate has one of the highest levels of alcohol-related hospital admissions for under 18s in Yorkshire, according to the Centre for Public Health.

Serial drink-driver avoids jail 'for being a woman',A judge tells Victoria Parry she would have been sent straight to prison if she were a man.,,None,"Image copyright Paul Beard Image caption If Victoria Parry had been a man ""it would have been straight down the stairs"" to prison, a judge said

A judge gave a serial drink-driver a chance to avoid jail because she is a woman.

Victoria Parry, 30, hit three other cars after downing a bottle of wine.

Judge Sarah Buckingham said Parry, an alcoholic who had escaped an abusive relationship, would have gone ""straight down the stairs"" to jail if she were a man.

Although Parry ""deserved"" a prison term, the judge gave her three months to address her issues.

The comments are being investigated by a judicial watchdog.

Prosecutor Tim Sapwell said Parry caught a van's rear bumper, a Vauxhall Insignia's wing mirror, then the side of a BMW ""very heavily"" in the crash.

'Shocking case'

He told Warwick Crown Court it caused her Fiat to spin off the A46 near Stratford-upon-Avon into a wooded area where it caught fire.

An off-duty police officer pulled her from the car, and Parry, who was banned from the road at the time, told him she had drunk a bottle of wine and ""shouldn't be driving"", Mr Sapwell said.

She was arrested, and registered a reading of almost three times the legal limit at a police station.

Lucy Tapper, defending, said Parry had a ""considerable drink problem"" after a 15-year abusive relationship, but had begun to tackle her alcohol intake.

The judge said: ""If Miss Parry was a man, there is no question it would have been straight down the stairs, because this is a shocking case of dangerous driving against a background of two previous convictions for excess alcohol.""

But, she said, the offence had been committed in May 2018, and Parry, who had admitted dangerous driving, had not been in trouble since.

""She has clearly got an alcohol problem. She is, whether she admits it or not, an alcoholic,"" the judge said.

Deferring sentencing for three months, judge Buckingham told Parry she ""richly deserved"" an immediate custodial term of 18 months.

""I want to see whether you can really address the issues rather than paying lip service,"" she said.

She ordered Parry to abstain from alcohol, attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and pay for private counselling.

If Parry complied, she said, the custody would not be made immediate.

""If you don't comply, I will conclude that you are not worthy of the chance,"" the judge added.

The Judicial Conduct Investigations Office confirmed it received a complaint about the remarks attributed to the judge.

Trending: Why Jim Wolf's makeover video went viral,A time-lapse makeover of a homeless US man has garnered more than 13 million YouTube hits in a week - but why do stories about the homeless gain such traction on social media? BBC Trending investigates.,,None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The two-hour make-over of a US Army veteran is shown in two minutes

A time-lapse makeover of a homeless US man has been watched more than 13 million times on YouTube in the past week.

In two minutes, former soldier Jim Wolf is shown making the transition from bearded and bedraggled to well-groomed and sharply-suited. Since then, the 54-year-old - who has long struggled against poverty, homelessness and alcoholism - has reportedly started to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and is now staying with his sister.

Producer Rob Bliss made the video to raise awareness and funds for a Grand Rapids homeless charity, Degage Ministries - which has received $50,000 (£30,000) in donations as a result.

Mr Wolf's is not the first story of this kind to gain such traction in social media networks. In September, donations of more than $110,000 (£70,000) poured in for Glen James, a homeless man in Boston who returned a lost bag containing £26,000 in cash and travellers cheques. Billy Ray Harris was able to buy himself a house in Kansas with £110,000 given by strangers touched by his honesty after he returned a £2,500 diamond ring accidentally dropped into his change cup earlier this year.

And in 2011, offers of radio work flooded in for Ted Williams after his smooth baritone was recorded by a local newspaper reporter who saw him asking for money by an Ohio roadside.

The release of the Jim Wolf video - timed to coincide with Veterans Day - has focused minds on the issue of homelessness. Even so, Mr Bliss, who makes viral videos for a living, described the response as ""pretty incredible"" - far outperforming any other content he has produced.

""The number one thing that makes a video likely to go viral is the feeling it creates,"" he told the BBC. ""The stronger that feeling, the more successful it will be.""

Alastair Murray, Project Director at Housing Justice, a UK-based Christian campaigning charity says the video reminds the audience of the possibility of losing a job, a home, and a stable life. ""This video helps people see the real person behind that bearded needy person about whom they feel awkwardness - there's a transformation into a person with whom you'd be happy to have a chat,"" he says.

"Could you be a workaholic, addicted to your job?","Most of us like to be a diligent worker, but what if you are actually addicted to your job?",,None,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Could working too hard and for too many hours be a form of addiction?

""My name is JC and I am a workaholic.""

JC, who lives in Tampa Bay, Florida, says she needed a lot of courage the first time she stood up and said that in front of a group of people she had never met before.

JC, who doesn't want us to reveal her full name, had gone along to a meeting of Workaholics Anonymous because she felt she couldn't cope anymore.

A 40-year-old healthcare worker, who had conquered her alcoholism and an eating disorder, she says she couldn't experience the serenity that she hoped sobriety would bring because she instead had become addicted to working.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption For many people securing a decent work/life balance is a tricky business

""I was constantly obsessed with work,"" she says. ""I realised I used work to numb out and avoid myself, my feelings and my fears.""

Her work addiction and the stress that came with it affected her health.

""I had premature grey hair within three months of starting a management position,"" she says. ""I experienced adrenal fatigue... I have a heart condition.""

Following a similar 12-step recovery plan to the one first devised by Alcoholics Anonymous, Workaholics Anonymous started in the US in the early 1980s.

Today there are more than 100 meeting groups around the world, from Argentina to the US, the UK and Japan. There is also the possibility of joining an online meeting via Skype or over the phone.

But how do you know if you are a workaholic? And what other ways are there to get help?

Wilmar Schaufeli, a professor of work and organisational psychology at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, describes a workaholic as ""a person who works obsessively hard in a compulsive way"".

Image copyright Jord Visser Image caption Wilmar Schaufeli says that Workaholics Anonymous works for many suffers, because they can realise they are not alone

""So it's a combination between excessive work and compulsive work, compulsive tendency.""

He adds that going to Workaholics Anonymous works for many sufferers because ""you see people who have the same problem, so you are not alone. I think this is an important thing for all kinds of behavioural problems or addictions.""

For other people with work addiction problems, having one-to-one therapy with a trained professional might be the answer.

But what actually can lead to work addition?

Dr Claudia Herbert, a clinical psychologist at the Oxford Development Centre, in Putney, Oxfordshire, often treats sufferers. She says that many workaholics have other mental health disorders.

""Lots of clients may feel depressed, they may actually think that life is a little bit empty, they may have anxiety problems, they may also have addictions to cope with.""

Image copyright Claudia Herbert Image caption Claudia Herbert says that many workaholics have other mental health problems

The condition can be triggered by someone having to work too hard in the first place. ""People often have to take jobs that in previous times would have been done by two or three people,"" she says.

Work addiction may be caused in part by a person being pushed too hard by his or her parents in their earlier life. ""People who as children were reinforced by their achievements rather than who they are, they are more likely to become work addicted,"" she adds.

When it comes to the types of jobs where people are more vulnerable to becoming workaholics, Prof Schaufeli says it is more a case of senior professionals rather than those with jobs on the lower rungs of the workplace ladder.

He says that self-employed people are also vulnerable because they can become obsessed by their businesses.

Prof Schaufeli adds that work addicts very often don't see that their behaviour is problematic because the fact they are doing vast amounts of work often means they are earning more and being promoted.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some workaholics are not said to recognise that anything is wrong because they have secured promotions and pay rises

When it comes to treating work addiction, Dr Herbert says it needs to be individually tailored to each sufferer, and getting to the bottom of what caused it.

At Retreat South, a rehabilitation centre and mental health retreat in the Australian state of Victoria, they run a work-related stress and executive burnout programme, trying to get people's work/life balance back.

The programme started six years ago, and the average length of stay is one month, with prices from 8,000 Australian dollars ($6,100; £4,400) per week.

Most of the clients are Australian, but they also have some from Asia and Europe.

""We work on the guilt - I haven't been a good parent, I haven't been a good partner,"" says Jane Enter, Retreat South's clinical director.

Children of alcoholics 'damaged',,,2006-09-03 23:57:15,"Children of alcoholics are more likely to become addicted

The Priory study said children of alcoholics were four times more likely to be addicted to drink and there was a risk of drug and gambling problems.

The private health provider said a child's early life was characterised by chaos, trauma, confusion and shame and, quite often, sexual and physical abuse.

The report found 55% of domestic violence occurs in alcoholic homes.

The children of alcoholics can break the cycle

Professor Martin Plant, addictions expert

The Priory reviewed existing data on crime, abuse and alcoholism as well as consulting its own doctors and therapists to compile the report.

It said the problems children of alcoholics experience in early life had a profound impact later in life.

The report said growing up in an alcoholic household was inextricably linked to abuse.

Some 55% of family violence occurs in alcoholic homes with alcohol a factor in 90% of child abuse cases.

Studies have also showed a third of daughters of alcoholics experienced physical abuse and a fifth sexual abuse - up to four times higher than in non-alcoholic homes, the Priory said.

The report said children reacted in one of three ways - either they became withdrawn, went into denial or used the experience to benefit themselves by becoming stronger.

Many of the children of alcoholics, even those who would perhaps have been withdrawn, could grow up to be likeable, kind and intuitive.

Difficulties

But the problems surfaced when they had to confront difficulties.

The report said: ""Their feelings about themselves are the opposite of the serene image they present - they generally feel insecure, inadequate, dull, unsuccessful, vulnerable and anxious"".

They also struggled to develop strong personal relationships.

Researchers said previous studies had revealed that 70% of children of alcoholics develop compulsive behaviour around either alcohol, drugs, food, sex, work or gambling, while a half ended up marrying alcoholics.

And they said children of alcoholics were four times more likely to become alcoholics - partly because of genetics - than the one in 20 of the general population that have the condition currently.

Priory addictions expert Dr Michael Bristow said: ""There is a widespread misconception that addiction is all about the addict, that it is solely the addict who suffer from his illness.

""The reality? Alcoholism affects the adult alcoholic's entire family, particularly the children.""

Professor Martin Plant, an addiction expert at the University of the West of England, said: ""These findings are not altogether surprising. But what I would like to stress, is that it is not inevitable.

""The children of alcoholics can break the cycle, many end up loathing alcohol and refusing to let it destroy their lives like it may have done to their parents.""","['priory', 'children', 'abuse', 'alcohol', 'report', 'damaged', 'alcoholics', 'likely', 'times', 'withdrawn', 'alcoholic']","Children of alcoholics are more likely to become addictedThe Priory study said children of alcoholics were four times more likely to be addicted to drink and there was a risk of drug and gambling problems.

Sixty-four years later, Thiesen has still not forgiven the Danish authorities.

One of Scotland's foremost investigative food journalists, Joanna Blythman, talks to Ricky about her life and work as a campaigner to help make our relationship with food a healthier one.

Is it OK to commit a crime if nobody ever finds out about it? That's the question we asked a group of young people as part of our Moral Minute series. Listen in to hear what they said.

BBC Scotland's Poet in Residence Stuart Paterson debuts his specially commissioned piece for the programme; a celebration of the religious festival of Diwali happening this week.

The power of music as a therapeutic tool in the treatment of dementia has been revelatory over the last few years. A new app has been launched to help people compile personal playlists to aid recall of memories and restore a sense of self. Andy Lowdnes, co-founder of the charity Playlist for Life, and Gaelic singer, Mhiari MacInnes, talk about the profound impact music can have on people's memories.

"Detox clinics putting patients at risk in England, regulator finds",The regulator has found many residential rehab clinics are not providing safe or good quality care.,,None,"Image copyright Getty Images

People undergoing detox for alcohol or drug addiction are being put at risk by residential clinics in England - as a lot of the care provided is not safe or good quality, the regulator has found.

The Care Quality Commission based its findings on inspections of the 68 independent services over two years.

Nearly three-quarters were found to be failing in at least one of the fundamental standards of care.

The regulator said detoxification can be ""difficult, unpleasant and risky"".

Last year more than 2,600 people underwent medical detox in a residential rehabilitation service in England - about 1% of the total number being treated for drug and alcohol addiction.

Lasting around five to 10 days, detox can involve fits and hallucinations, as well as a risk of suicide or painkiller drug overdose.

Given this, Dr Paul Lelliott, from the CQC, said he was ""deeply concerned"" because many of the providers of these services in England are not following national clinical guidelines.

Safe care and treatment was where the most breaches were found, with 63% of clinics not meeting this standard when they were first inspected.

Staff were also handling medications incorrectly, administering drugs such as methadone and paracetamol without the right training or too often.

Many clinics were also not assessing safety risks before patients were admitted or following national guidance on how to treat people in withdrawal.

For example, in at least one case, the CQC found staff didn't plan how they would manage a person's epileptic fits during their withdrawal, despite knowing they were at risk of having seizures.

Many staff were also not given full employment checks or sufficient training.

Image copyright Getty Images

Dr Lelliott said: ""While we have found some services that are providing good care and we are beginning to see improvements, all providers need to review their practice so that we can be assured that they are delivering safe and effective care.

""Detoxification under clinical supervision is often the first stage of a person's addiction treatment. It can be a difficult, unpleasant and sometimes, risky experience. It is vital that providers get this right to support people's onward rehabilitation and recovery.""

Four of the services are no longer operating.

Getting recovery on track

Rosanna O'Connor, at Public Health England, said: ""While residential detox makes up a small part of the overall treatment system, seeing about 1% of all in treatment, they do have a vital role.

""It's crucial these services are in line with best practice, as the clinical guidelines on drug treatment clearly set out.

""This helps ensure not only safety but gives some of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people the best chance of getting their recovery on track.""

The CQC now plans to rate the other independent services that treat people for substance misuse.

Prof Colin Drummond, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the report ""shows systemic failings in the way these services are provided and that people undergoing detoxification are being exposed to unnecessary risks"".

Bosence Farm drug unit fears funding future,The head of a drug and alcohol rehabilitation unit in Cornwall fears changes in government funding could threaten its future.,,None,"Image caption Bosence Farm has been helping people with drug and alcohol dependence for 16 years

The head of a Cornish drug and alcohol rehabilitation unit says he fears changes in government funding could threaten its future.

Bosence Farm near Hayle, treats patients on programmes lasting from nine to 12 months.

Derek Mace says he fears these may now be cut back because of the uncertain economic climate.

The Department of Health says a final decision will not be made until later this year.

Bosence Farm has been providing residential help for people with drug and alcohol dependence since 1995.

Mr Mace said: ""Those people who stay around for nine or 10 months are the ones who are best equipped to engage properly with the wider society and stay off drink and drugs on a permanent basis.""

The addiction recovery programme includes psychotherapy, yoga, meditation and relaxation.

Staff use a 12-step programme recommended by Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous.

'Amazing benefits'

Jack, who has been a patient at the farm for nine months, said: ""I came to save my life really. I would be dead otherwise, I took heroin, alcohol, pills, anything really.

""This is the first 12-step programme I have ever tried. The benefits I am getting from it now are amazing. If I left after six months it would have been a complete waste of time. You're going straight back into the lion's den.""

Bob Crossland, of the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Drug and Alcohol Action Team said, he was more optimistic about funding.

""Payment by results is a worry for a lot of people for lots of reasons, but it's also a potential opportunity to get more money in the future.""

How jeans giant Levi Strauss got its mojo back,The US clothing firm is now enjoying five years of profit growth as it recovers from past woes.,,None,"Image copyright Levi Strauss

Chip Bergh has the air of man at ease with the world. But things could have turned out very different, given what he calls his ""dysfunctional"" childhood.

The 60-year-old chief executive of Levi Strauss, dressed in regulation blue jeans and denim shirt, readily admits to be being ""blessed and lucky"".

Six years into his successful turnaround of the once struggling US clothing firm, he says the job still gives him a ""wow"" feeling.

Mr Bergh and his family also love their San Francisco lifestyle, where the vegan boss pursues a passion for marathons and triathlons.

So, professionally and personally, things are going well for the former Procter & Gamble (P&G) executive.

But growing up in the suburbs of New York City there were times when he felt neither blessed nor lucky.

Mr Bergh's father was an advertising salesman working 14-hour days. He was also an alcoholic.

Image copyright Devaki Knowles

There could be ""lots of screaming and yelling"" at home, Mr Bergh recalls. ""Mum and dad were always getting in fights.""

One day his mother threatened to throw out his dad. ""That was a wake up call,"" says Mr Bergh.

His father then finally went to Alcoholics Anonymous, cleaned himself up and never touched another drop.

""I'm proud that my dad recovered,"" says Mr Bergh. ""He rebuilt his life.""

Mr Bergh's childhood wasn't unhappy. ""I had a lot of friends, played a lot of sport, and went to a great school,"" he says. But as the eldest of three children he says he shouldered much of the domestic discord, and grew up fast.

It left its mark and is in part behind his drive to succeed, he thinks. It also left a determination not to repeat some of his father's mistakes.

""I'm pretty level-headed,"" says Mr Bergh. ""There's not a lot that really upsets me. I'm not a yeller and screamer, at home or work. I'm pretty relaxed."" And he doesn't drink.

Image copyright Levi Strauss Image caption Levi Strauss emigrated to the US from Germany in 1853 when he was 18

So, how does Mr Bergh sum up his management style? ""Very open, honest, transparent. What you see is what you get.""

He insists he's ""really down to earth"", adding: ""I put my pants on the same way everybody else does - one leg at a time.""

Just don't confuse this regular-guy image with a lack of steel, as Mr Bergh's overhaul of Levi's has been radical, some might say brutal.

The company was created in 1873 when San Francisco-based wholesale merchant Levi Strauss and a business partner patented a way to strengthen denim trousers using copper rivets. The rest as they say is history.

Through slick advertising and campaigning on social and political issues (such as donating millions to HIV/Aids charities), Levi's punched above its weight for decades.

Stories were common in the 1960s and 1970s of young Westerners packing Levi's jeans in their luggage to help barter their way through holidays behind the Iron Curtain.

If ever a brand deserved the label ""iconic"", Levi's was it.

Image copyright Levi Strauss Image caption The Levi 501 jeans are arguably the company's single most important product

But by the time Mr Bergh took over in 2011, the company he calls the original Silicon Valley start-up ""had lost its way"".

Annual sales peaked in 1997 at $7.1bn (£5.3bn). ""We were bigger than Nike then,"" says Mr Bergh. ""Nike aspired to be like Levi's.""

But Levi's lost its knack of combining heritage with changing trends, and by the early 2000s sales had fallen to $4bn.

Competition from the likes of Walmart and Gap had increased rapidly. Levi had also borrowed heavily, chiefly to buy out scores of Strauss family descendants, and consolidate ownership.

The result, says Mr Bergh, was that the firm found it had to ""cut costs, cut marketing, to save cash"".

Levi's board ultimately decided it needed a fresh pair of hands, and so turned to Mr Bergh, who had the brand expertise and international experience it wanted.

After 28 years at P&G, most latterly working on the Old Spice deodorant and razors accounts, Mr Bergh saw a chance to fulfil an ambition to become a chief executive.

""It was too good an opportunity to pass,"" he says. ""It was an opportunity to make a difference, and leave a legacy.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chip Bergh is not afraid to ""double denim""

All too aware that Levi's was struggling, Mr Bergh sent the firm's then top 60 managers six questions about the pros and cons of the business - and started interviewing each of them.

""But by about the 15th interview it was pretty clear what needed to be done,"" he says. ""There was no strategy, there was no alignment across the organisation... People were frustrated.""

More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world:

Mr Bergh invested in facilities, broadened the clothing range (especially womenswear), and expanded in relatively untapped markets such as Russia, China and India.

The ecommerce operation, previously outsourced and treated almost as an after-thought, was brought in-house, modernised and expanded.

Mr Bergh also changed the top team at the business. Within 18 months of his appointment, nine of the 11-member executive team had left. Of the current 150 senior managers, two-thirds have been with the company for three years or less.

He says: ""We needed to change not just the business but the culture, and the best way to change the culture is to change the leadership.""

Mr Bergh admits the clear out was dramatic, sometimes traumatic, but says: ""You always have to do the harder right than the easier wrong.""

Did he learn such decisiveness in the army, which he joined for two years after school? Making quick decisions was certainly part of the skill-set, he says. But the army also taught him about leadership.

""It's wrong that the army is all about deference and saluting seniors,"" he says. ""You have to earn respect, build trust, be willing to make decisions, coach people and train people - all those skills are transferable to the corporate world.""

The army's downside was that promotion moved slowly, and Mr Bergh wanted to ""move ahead quickly"". A recruitment firm found him a job at P&G.

Levi's turnaround seems to be succeeding, with 2017 expected to see the fifth consecutive year of profits growth.

Retail analyst Marshal Cohen, of market research group NPD, says that yet again Levi's has been able to ""reinvent"" itself to a new generation.

However, Mr Bergh says the job is far from finished. ""We have made really good progress. It's been harder and taken longer than I expected.

""I'm not satisfied with where we are. We still have a lot more work to do.""","['image', 'levi', 'levis', 'strauss', 'giant', 'way', 'business', 'caption', 'copyright', 'bergh', 'mr', 'mojo', 'jeans']","Image copyright Levi StraussChip Bergh has the air of man at ease with the world.

'How I lost my dad to alcohol addiction',When Charlotte's dad was taken to hospital he couldn't open his mouth any more.,,None,"When Charlotte's dad was taken to hospital he couldn't open his mouth any more.

His face was paralysed and his heart and liver had become enlarged after years of drinking far too much alcohol.

Then one by one, his internal organs shut down. He died just before Christmas last year, aged 59.

But Charlotte, 27, tells Newsbeat she feels like she lost him to alcohol addiction years ago.

""In your teenage years you become more aware of your parents' behaviour,"" she says.

""I'd realise that finding bottles of wine hidden behind the sofa isn't normal. Finding dad passed out in front of the television at two o'clock in the morning isn't normal.""

I'd realise that finding bottles of wine hidden behind the sofa isn't normal

Hiding it

Charlotte was about 15 when she realised her dad, Iain Hayman, was having problems with alcohol.

""The older I got the more I realised his relationship with alcohol was incredibly unhealthy because he was hiding it. He'd lie to mum and say, 'I haven't had a drink today' and you'd think, 'I saw you earlier. Yes you did.'

""We never knew how much he was drinking. It started off with a bottle of wine a night and then it would go up to three or four.

""Every time you find a bottle of wine you struggle with 'Do I dob him in and cause an argument or do I lie to my mum?'

""The more you tidied, the more you found out about dad.""

'It's quite an embarrassing illness'

Charlotte explains how her father was effectively ""living two lives"".

""I'd come home from school and he'd be asleep in bed. He'd be really down,"" she says.

""It was a slow deterioration. Every time he felt positive you really wanted to get behind him and support him, which is what he needed..

I'll have days when I remember the nice things, and then there are days when I have the horrible memories

""But the more it happened and the more he failed, it became difficult to put that aside.

""He was living two lives because until I was 18 it didn't really come out that he was an alcoholic

""He hid very well that he wasn't paying the mortgage [on our house].

""It came out that we were really close to losing the house. We had bailiffs knocking on the door.

""I was working in the village pub and you'd often be told stories like 'Charlotte, I saw your dad passed out on the path and I almost tripped over him.'

""It's quite an embarrassing illness for your parent to have because they lose their inhibitions and don't care what people think of them.""

Daddy's girl

""I was a proper daddy's girl. We were very close.

Your teenage years are difficult enough. To have that as an extra worry, you just don't need it.

""I have so many nice memories of him. I'll have days when I remember the nice things, and then there are days when I have the horrible memories and I think of him drunk, and I think of him not able to stop for us.

""It's a mixed bag of emotions because you have the anger that he did this to himself.""

Role reversal

""It was a role reversal because you end up looking out for him and making sure he gets ready for the day. And then always worrying about what he was doing.

""Your teenage years are difficult enough. To have that as an extra worry, you just don't need it.

""You should be able to rely on your parents to help you and support you, and it just wasn't there [from him]. Emotionally it's very difficult.""

I distanced myself from him

After years of struggling with the effects of Iain's addiction, Charlotte's mum decided she couldn't take any more. She asked him to move out of their home last year.

Sadly, that's when his drinking increased. He'd lost his job and even began stealing alcohol.

""In the last year I distanced myself from him because I found it too difficult. You really wanted to get behind him and support him, but the more he failed [to stop drinking] it became difficult to put that aside.

""He was in a bad way again, he was out of breath. And then he ended up fainting, got an ambulance to the hospital, and then he never came out.

""He couldn't even talk for the last three weeks of his life.

""You have this anger that he's done this to himself. But we all just had to put it to one side and we just had to be forgiving.

""Now we can grieve the man we lost when I was a teenager.""

Ant McPartlin has thanked fans for their support after revealing doctors warned he could have died from his painkiller and alcohol addictions.

In a Twitter post, Ant wrote that he was ""overwhelmed"" by the positive feedback he had received.

The star has received more than 2,000 tweets in response to his message.

Ant entered rehab in June, having become addicted to alcohol and prescription painkillers following a knee operation in 2015.

The Bafta-winning star of shows including Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway and I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here! spoke to The Sun on Sunday after spending two months in rehab.

He said his wife Lisa and TV partner and friend Declan Donnelly had encouraged him to seek help.

""I was at the point where anything - prescription drugs, non-prescription drugs - I would take,"" he said.

""And take them with alcohol, which is ridiculous. The doctors told me, 'You could have killed yourself'.""

He told the newspaper that Dec got involved earlier this year after he delayed a second knee operation so he could carry on working on ITV show Britain's Got Talent.

After undergoing surgery following the show's final, McPartlin said he was ""just done"" and after an hour-long chat with Dec, he entered a rehab clinic.

The star is now clean from both prescription drugs and alcohol.

Lou Vincent: The most brutal form of apology,Cricketer Lou Vincent this week admitted he was a cheat. His apology came in stark style.,,None,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lou Vincent

The cricketer Lou Vincent has admitted attempting to fix matches. His apology came in stark style.

He exhales loudly. Then he begins his statement: ""My name is Lou Vincent and I am a cheat.""

The former New Zealand cricketer, in 10 words, admits what he has done, how he has contravened and undermined his own sport by accepting money for match-fixing. Viewers are left in no doubt.

Vincent, at the age of 35, has been banned for life from playing, coaching or participating in any other way in organised cricket after breaching 18 anti-corruption rules in matches played in 2008 and 2011.

Even so, the nature of the opening of his video confession - in which he goes on to say he has ""shamed"" his sport, country and family - seems unusually stark.

The formula of the opening words is the same as that used by some members of Alcoholics Anonymous. Those attending at meetings are not compelled to say: ""My name is XXXX and I am an alcoholic."" But many choose to do so, citing its cathartic effect and the creation of a sense of community.

Vincent, who has suffered from depression, is unlikely to feel the same immediate mutual support from his fellow cricketers. But might he eventually gain respect for his statement, in which he also says he wants to face up to what he has done ""like a man and accept the consequences""?

""It's very healthy,"" says Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at Lancaster University. ""You don't get enough of people admitting when they've done something wrong, particularly in the workplace.""

Uruguayan footballer Luis Suarez has faced criticism over his initial refusal to apologise for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini in a World Cup match. He has since given a qualified apology - one that expressed sympathy for his victim but did not fully address Suarez's culpability and ongoing problem.

""What the cricketer has done is completely unlike the Suarez situation,"" says Cooper. ""If Suarez had come out straight away and said he'd done wrong under the stress of the situation he would have received much more sympathy. What's happened here in cricket will raise Vincent in people's estimation. The timing is absolutely key.""

Vincent recorded his statement after admitting to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) that he had committed match-fixing offences in Twenty20 games when he played for Lancashire and Sussex. It pre-empted the ECB's own announcement.

Sussex County Cricket Club has welcomed the punishment of Vincent, who has played in 23 Tests and 102 one-day internationals. ""The episode has been a very difficult time for our players, staff and indeed all supporters of Sussex Cricket,"" says chief executive Zac Toumazi. ""We are determined to do all we can to drive this issue away from our game and remain vigilant and committed in doing so.""

Cricket is keen to clean up its image after revelations going back more than a decade, when it was revealed the South African captain Hansie Cronje had fixed matches.

In his confession in 2000, Cronje opened by saying he had been a Christian all his life and had tried to ""walk the way the Lord wanted me to walk"".

The golfer Tiger Woods, in his scripted 2010 apology in front of the world's media for his marital infidelities, also adopted a more gradual introduction to the description of his wrongdoings than Vincent.

""Good morning. And thank you for joining me,"" he said. ""Many of you in the room are my friends. Many of you in this room know me. Many of you have cheered for me, or worked with me, or supported me, and now, every one of you has good reason to be critical of me.

""I want to say to each of you, simply, and directly, I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish behaviour I engaged in.""

Could Vincent's more direct statement lead to some form of public redemption, even if it does not, and cannot, involve any future involvement with cricket?

""What he has done is probably the best way,"" says speechwriter and presentation coach Max Atkinson. ""It reminds me of (Liberal Democrat leader) Paddy Ashdown in 1992 admitting he had had an affair. That worked. He came across as honest. It's best just to come out and say it.""

The difference is that Ashdown could argue his personal life did not interfere with his professional one. Like Cronje, Vincent cannot.

But Peter Davies, a consultant at Manchester PR firm RMS, thinks there is a chance of a return to some standing. ""Lou Vincent's statement comes across like it's personal,"" he says. ""That's good. Although he must have had advice, probably including from his lawyers, it doesn't sound like that. It's not over-scripted and he does it in his own voice.

""But Vincent has lots of work to do if he wants to change his image. He'll have to do something to show he's trying to make a difference and he's truly changed his ways.""

How to tell if you’re a workaholic,There’s a difference between pulling long hours and having an out-of-control urge to work. But where’s the line? Alison Birrane reports,Alison Birrane,2016-10-17 00:00:00,"Everyone loves a hard worker.

In fact, pulling long hours on the job and earning big is considered by many to be the modern mark of success. Being labelled a workaholic is, as often as not, seen as a badge of honour.

But for some, the obsessive need to work comes at the expense of everything else. Health, relationships and even work quality can suffer. It's a high price to pay.

Workaholics are less productive than colleagues with a healthier attitude and approach to work

Whatever the case, a compulsion to work has been leading people to therapists and self-help groups for years. It can even be deadly. Earlier this month, a Japanese government study found one fifth of the Japanese workforce is at risk of death from overwork.

Overwork isn’t just a problem in Japan. Workaholics Anonymous, a 12-step programme which models itself on Alcoholics Anonymous, held its first international conference in the UK in June, with attendees hailing from across the globe.

There has been little research into why workaholism develops. But that’s changing – in recent years, the phenomenon has begun to get more attention and is being treated as more than just a buzzword.

Workaholism is not recognised as a medical condition by the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which is considered the gold standard in diagnosing mental disorders.

Another large-scale study linked workaholic tendencies to other psychiatric issues, like obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety and depression

But even without a precise definition, its impact is being linked to health, workplace and mental issues, and researchers are taking note. A recent meta-analysis – a quantitative summary of the existing research into workaholism – by the University of Georgia showed, among other things, that workaholics are less productive than colleagues with a healthier attitude and approach to work.

Another large-scale study, published in May by the University of Bergen in Norway, linked workaholic tendencies to other psychiatric issues, like obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety and depression.

Not your best work

But when does hard work turn negative? What might lead someone to believe they are a 'work addict'? Well, workaholism is a compulsion – an obsessive and out-of-control urge to work, or think about it, says Bryan Robinson, a psychotherapist based in North Carolina who conducted early research into the effects of work addiction and wrote Chained to the Desk, a guidebook for workaholics.

""Workaholism is not defined by hours. It's defined by what's going on inside of us,” he says.

“A workaholic is someone who's on the ski slopes dreaming about being back at work. A healthy worker is at work, dreaming about being on the ski slopes.”

Robinson, who has counselled people who have divorced, been fired or driven to health crises as a result of chronic overwork, recalls one client who would tell her husband she was at the gym, but instead would go to work before changing into workout clothes and dousing herself in water to make it look like she'd been sweating.

Sound like someone you know?

But workaholics are not necessarily producing the best work or are any more engaged at the office than their colleagues, the University of Georgia meta-analysis found.

Malissa A Clark, an assistant professor of industrial and organisational psychology at the University of Georgia, led the study. She says workaholics reported greater job stress, lower job satisfaction, lower life satisfaction and more burnout.

Warning signs The Bergen Work Addiction Scale uses seven basic criteria to identify work addiction, scored as follows: (1) Never, (2) Rarely, (3) Sometimes, (4) Often, and (5) Always. If you score “often” or “always” on at least four of the seven criteria, you may be a workaholic. You think of how you can free up more time to work.

You spend much more time working than initially intended.

You work in order to reduce feelings of guilt, anxiety, helplessness and depression.

You have been told by others to cut down on work without listening to them.

You become stressed if you are prohibited from working.

You deprioritise hobbies, leisure activities, and exercise because of your work.

You work so much that it has negatively influenced your health

They also reported greater work-life conflict, lower physical and mental health and detrimental outcomes for family, such as marital problems.

“There's not a lot of positive outcomes,” she adds, despite the concept of workaholism often being linked with traits like being driven, competitive, ambitious and productive.

Help in high water

Think you might have a problem? There are a couple of self-assessments you can take.

Norwegian researchers have created the Bergen Work Addiction Scale, where you can gauge your behavior, feelings and attitude towards work. Workaholics Anonymous also has an online questionnaire that can help you determine if you might need to seek help.

The first step, experts say, is to admit you have a problem.

For Robinson, who calls himself a recovering workaholic, treatment involves mindfulness, therapy, behavioural changes and uncovering the underlying issues. “There are root causes to it. Sometimes it's self-esteem, sometimes it's a way to modulate anxiety,” he says.

The drug for workaholics is adrenaline

For Bob, 61, of California, admitting he had a problem came when his wife told him she'd had enough of waking up the middle of the night and discovering him absent, still at the office. Bob – who preferred to use only his first name to preserve the anonymity of the Workaholics Anonymous programme – is now an outreach officer for Workaholics Anonymous, a volunteer position.

“The drug for workaholics is adrenaline,” he says. “Stress, pressure, crisis, deadlines, those all allow the ability get adrenalised and the ability to operate at a frantic pace.”

Bob had his first jobs at five years old – helping his brother deliver newspapers, recycling cans and bottles, mowing lawns and shovelling snow. He became a successful businessman, but ultimately his health suffered, and if he'd not sought help, his family-life would have too, he said. His wife had had enough.

“Her no longer being willing to live like that is what gave me the willingness to finally pursue this programme with some commitment and conviction,” Bob says.

Work, like food, is not something you can just give up cold turkey

But work, like food, is not something you can just give up cold turkey. So how can you control your impulse to work incessantly? “It's having a plan and following a plan, versus, compulsively diving in to whatever pops up,” says Bob. That means scheduling work hours, focusing on one thing at time, and if something unexpected arises, rather than chaotically trying to cram everything in and multi-tasking, going back to your list and reprioritising.

Other treatment options include finding a therapist who is versed in this area. Or, you can attend outpatient workshops and programmes. And, now inpatient residential programmes, such as that offered by The Bridge To Recovery, located in Ohio in the US, are offering help for workaholics alongside other treatments for obsessive or compulsive behaviours, anxiety and depression.

But a big factor in the lack of available treatment, says Clark, is lack of research. “There's not a lot of research on how it develops and there's almost no research on the relationship between workaholism and clinical disorders.” The Norwegian study is one of the first.

More research is needed, she says, “so it becomes more mainstream rather than this fringe topic buzzword that people throw out there. It does have legitimate detrimental outcomes to people's lives and people's well-being.”

#BBCtrending: Bello! The UCL students spammed by their president,"An email simply reading 'bello' triggered 3,000 replies, and gave birth to a new meme.",,None,"Image copyright @punderachiever

When students at a leading London university were sent a mysterious email from a senior official, the #Bellogate meme was born.

Students at University College London were sent an email last night, purportedly from the university president, Michael Arthur. It simply contained a one word greeting - ""bello"". By the morning, the message had generated a gigantic email thread, with some students waking up to almost 3,000 unread messages.

The hashtag was the top trend on Twitter overnight in the UK, with more than 5,000 tweets using the term since the ""Bello"" email appeared. Many shared emails generated in the thread - in which students continued spamming each other with jokes and puns. ""Bello? Is it me you're looking for"", read one - a play on a Lionel Ritchie song. Others sent invites to cyber security courses, and appealed for missing items of stationery. Some reported they had been signed up to porn sites, dating companies, Alcoholics Anonymous and Sarah Palin's website. A parody account soon emerged.

Most seemed to see the funny side. ""Ooo we all just got signed up to the Miley Cyrus mailing list. #Bellogate #BelloCameInLikeAWreckingBall"", the UCL Cheesegrater magazine tweeted. One PhD student wrote: ""The funniest thing happened to UCL in years, can't stop laughing."" While some have questioned UCL's security policies, and expressed frustration about having to delete hundreds of unwanted messages, the sharpest criticism was directed at students who kept posting to the thread, by hitting ""reply all"" to the original email.

UCL has apologised for ""multiple emails"" received by students, and shut down the mailing list concerned. It is not known yet who was responsible, although some have jokingly pointed the finger at UCL's rival, King's College. President Arthur has so far remained silent on the matter.

FA Cup: Ex-Everton midfielder George Green on self-destruction and depression,"He was once compared to Wayne Rooney before a cocaine addiction saw George Green go from a Â£110,000-a-year midfielder to Â£80-a-game at Ossett Albion.",,2018-09-22 19:48:45,"Everton's George Green, then aged 17, tackles Liverpool's Seyi Ojo in an Under-18 game in November 2013

It is October 2011 and 15-year-old George Green is travelling to London for a trial with Tottenham Hotspur when a phone call changes everything. Everton have agreed a £2m deal with Bradford City for the schoolboy midfielder.

Green signs a two-and-a-half-year contract, receives a £45,000 signing-on fee in three instalments of £15,000, and a promising future with the Toffees beckons for the Dewsbury teenager.

Four years later he is standing on railway tracks near his hometown waiting for the next train so that he can end his life, Green's hopes of making it as a Premier League player ruined by cocaine and alcohol.

""I was in that much debt, I thought I'd lost my partner because of my drug use, and I didn't see a way back for me with football,"" the 22-year-old told BBC Sport.

Now at sixth-tier Chester, who beat City of Liverpool 4-0 in the FA Cup second qualifying round on Saturday, Green opens up about having too much too soon, self-destruction, depression and how he is attempting to rebuild his life.

""Mental health and addiction is an everyday battle. I'm giving it my best shot,"" he says. ""If others can learn from it, I'd rather help.""

'A £2,000-a-month cocaine addiction'

It was Everton Under-21s boss David Unsworth who broke the news to a tearful Green, then aged 19, he was no longer required after a loan at League Two Tranmere Rovers in 2015.

He had arrived at Goodison Park a fresh-faced schoolboy and was quickly compared to Wayne Rooney, who made his senior debut for the club aged 16.

Green left without playing a first-team game having spent five weeks of his four years at Goodison Park in London's Priory hospital, which provides a range of mental health and addictions treatments.

""Everton paid for it all, I think it was about £5,000-a-week,"" said Green, who was playing in the Toffees' U21 side by the age of 16 alongside future England internationals John Stones and Ross Barkley.

""Before I turned 18 you wouldn't catch me out at night. As soon as I was 18 it was like a new world opened up. I was drinking, doing drugs and playing football.

""The first time I took drugs I'd gone to watch football in a pub with mates. I was offered cocaine and it changed my life.""

At first Green was able to hide his habit from the likes of Kevin Sheedy, his youth-team coach, but before long he was taking 30 grams a month and life was spiralling out of control.

""I was spending way over £2,000 a month. I remember one particular Monday morning I was supposed to be training. I didn't wake up until the afternoon.

""The night before I'd gone to a friend's house for drink and drugs. I think that's when alarm bells started ringing at Everton.

""I remember phoning a welfare officer at Everton one night. I was crying and said 'I need help'. Soon after I was admitted to the Priory.""

Drugs and alcohol took a toll on Green. Here he is aged 19 signing for non-league Ossett Albion five months after being released by Everton

'I've earned £500,000 - I've got an iPad to show for it'

Having joined Everton as a £150-a-week schoolboy, Green's earnings reached £110,000-a-year at the Premier League club.

Since leaving three years ago, he has also had spells with Burnley and Oldham Athletic - as well as Viking in Norway's top flight under Englishman Ian Burchnall, now boss at Swedish side Ostersunds.

Green, who has also featured in the Scottish Premiership for Kilmarnock, believes he has earned at least £500,000 playing football.

""I have an iPad to show for it. That's how much of a downfall my life has become because of drugs,"" he added.

""I squandered it all. I'm embarrassed.""

At Everton, the former England youth international did most of his socialising back home in Yorkshire.

""A good night out? I'd easily spend about £1,500. A meal would cost between £200 and £300,"" he said.

""I'd be like 'let's get a bottle of champagne' and then a girl would come and sit next to me and I'd be like 'would you like a bottle of champagne?'

""Earning the money I was, I thought it was never going to end.

""Everybody wanted to know who I was and I was enjoying life. But I never got introduced to people who would keep me on the straight and narrow. They drank or did drugs and I fell into that circle.

""I got a brand new Mercedes-Benz A-Class and did about £4,000 damage to it. That stemmed from drink-driving. I was ridiculous, I used to drink-drive everywhere.""

Before he turned 18 and problems with drink and drugs, Green (centre) was compared to Wayne Rooney

'It wasn't my time to go'

Green had four clubs within 14 months of leaving Everton. Soon after his release from the Toffees, he joined League One Oldham on a two-year deal. He lasted five months before his contract was cancelled by mutual consent in November 2015.

""It was due to drink and drugs, I'd fallen out of love with the game and decided I didn't want to play any more.""

By now, Green was on a downward spiral. He had a drink-driving conviction and, after blowing much of his earnings on alcohol and cocaine, he was struggling financially. In addition, he was suffering from depression.

He did not stay away from football for long.

A week after leaving Oldham, Green had signed for non-league Yorkshire side Ossett Albion for £80-a-game. He had gone from Everton to the eighth tier of English football in less than six months.

It was around this time he first contemplated suicide.

""Leaving Everton hit me hard,"" he said. ""I was stood on a railway track close to Mirfield station near Dewsbury ready for a train to come. I remember it being around eight or nine o'clock at night.

""I hadn't written a note. It was all the pressures of everything in my life. The drugs, the alcohol, my mental health, football wasn't going well, lack of money.

""Then there was an announcement over the speakers that the next train was delayed.

""I thought 'it must be a sign that it can't be my time to go'. I broke down in tears and walked away.""

Green's mental health problems continued. He took an overdose after joining Salford City on loan from Burnley in early 2017.

""I went in the pill cupboard at home and took everything there was. I wanted to die at that time,"" he added.

Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville, Salford's co-owner, offered his support.

Green said: ""I was invited round to his house. I had been in hospital for taking too many tablets. We spoke for an hour about football and things Salford could do to help me.""

Five months clean and a baby on the way

He lives near Dewsbury with his two-year-old daughter Daisy and fiancee, Charli, while the couple are due to welcome a baby boy to the family in October.

Gone are the flash cars and the hangers-on who formed part of his life when he was at Everton.

Instead of a Mercedes-Benz A-Class, Green now drives a Kia Rio to and from Chester, the club he joined in July from National League North rivals Nuneaton.

Money is tight but the player blames no-one but himself.

Green is rebuilding his life with fiancee Charli and two-year-old daughter Daisy

He relapsed in April but says he has not touched drink or drugs since, and attends weekly Alcoholics Anonymous and Cocaine Anonymous meetings.

Green's support network includes former Aston Villa and England defender Gary Charles, a recovering alcoholic who now has a business which provides care to people who are experiencing a wide range of problems, including depression and alcohol/drug dependency.

""There's not a day I don't speak to him. He's a lifesaver,"" adds Green.

'Without football, I'd be dead'

At the time of this interview, Green has an additional battle in his life. Two months after signing, he has yet to make his Chester debut because of a back injury which is likely to require surgery. He's frustrated and impatient.

He has kept himself busy by getting to know Chester fans at home games, signing autographs and posing for pictures.

Chester, a fan-owned club with a community trust, run a weekly mental health and wellbeing session which offers vulnerable members of society a chance to get out and play football.

Green hopes opening up about his problems will raise awareness of mental health and addiction issues.

""Football is the only thing I am good at. Without it I'd be dead,"" he added.

""I thought my career would be over if I came out and started talking about my issues with drugs.

""Then I said to myself 'how about being honest for once in your life and admit your problems'.

""If my story helps one person, I'm happy to tell it. I'm happier, healthier and way more positive than I was.""

Teacher Steven Watt struck off for drunken behaviour at music camp,A primary teacher is struck off after getting drunk at a music camp and climbing into the bed of a male pupil.,,None,"A primary teacher has been struck off after getting drunk at a music camp and climbing into the bed of a male pupil.

Steven Watt, 41, was employed by Angus Council at the time of the incident in October 2011.

At a General Teaching Council hearing, he admitted charges including being intoxicated while caring for children.

A panel determined Watt's behaviour fell ""significantly short of the standards expected of a registered teacher"" and deemed him unfit to teach.

The complaint to the General Teaching Council for Scotland related to incidents during a music band camp on the evening of 28 October and the next morning.

Alcohol problem

The panel heard Watt engaged in conversation and made remarks to a number of children in his care which were ""inappropriate and offensive"".

He suggested to a number of male pupils in a dormitory that he was conducting a survey. He then asked one pupil if he was ""camp"" and told him ""it was okay to be gay these days"".

A further charge said he later drove a vehicle while ""intoxicated by alcohol or some other substance"".

Watt told the panel he had suffered from an alcohol problem for much of his life but following the incident at the music camp he was now attending Alcoholics Anonymous.

Watt said he missed teaching and that he would like to return to the profession.

Peter Holder jailed for 1988 rape of woman,A man who dragged a woman from a phone box and raped her 26 years ago is jailed.,,None,"Image copyright Police Image caption Peter Holder admitted the charges at Reading Crown Court last month

A man who dragged a woman from a phone box and raped her 26 years ago has been jailed for 11 and a half years after a review linked his DNA to the crime.

Peter Holder was 22 when he grabbed the 30-year-old woman in Reading and raped her in a car park. He drove her two miles before letting her go.

Holder, 48, from Tippett Rise, pleaded guilty in August to rape.

Reading Crown Court heard Holder was jailed for three years and four months in 2010 for another historical crime.

Holder pleaded guilty to an attempted rape he committed 1987 - five months before the Reading attack - following another cold case review.

'Frightened to go out'

Holder, who also admitted indecent assault and kidnap in relation to the 1988 attack, was only arrested in May this year when modern technology identified DNA found on the woman belonged to him.

Judge Joanna Cutts said the delay was caused either because of the technology at the time not identifying the DNA or because there had been no match found at the time.

On the night of the attack the woman had been drinking after leaving an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

Alan Blake, prosecuting, said she realised that she was not safe to walk home so she went into a phone box in Watlington Street to call a taxi.

Holder and another man dragged her out before he raped and indecently assaulted her. The woman was driven to Shinfield where she was freed.

Further details about the other man were not mentioned in court.

Reading the victim's impact statement, Judge Cutts said: ""Peter Holder took away my life. He took away all my self-worth.""

Judge Cutts added: ""She has been unable to work since the incident. She is still all these years later frightened to go out.""

Holder was put on the sex offenders register for life.","['jailed', 'peter', '1988', 'technology', 'woman', 'man', 'holder', 'attack', 'cutts', 'rape', 'reading', 'raped', 'dna', 'took']","Peter Holder was 22 when he grabbed the 30-year-old woman in Reading and raped her in a car park.

Lars von Trier unsure over film future,Danish film director Lars von Trier fears he will not make any more films now he is no longer taking drugs or drinking alcohol.,,None,"Image copyright AP Image caption Born Lars Trier, he added the Von while at the National Film School of Denmark

Danish film director Lars von Trier fears he will not make any more films now he is no longer taking drugs or drinking alcohol.

The controversial film-maker, whose films include Nymphomaniac and Breaking the Waves, revealed his concerns in an interview with Danish paper Politiken.

He told the broadsheet he no longer drank a bottle of vodka a day or took ""narcotics"".

""I don't know whether I can make more films. And that haunts me,"" he said.

""No creative expression of artistic value has ever been carried out by former alcoholics and drug addicts,"" Von Trier told the newspaper.

It was his first interview since Cannes Film Festival organisers banned him from their event in 2011 after he joked he was a Nazi at a news conference to promote his science fiction film Melancholia.

Von Trier said he was 90 days sober on Sunday, adding he attended meetings at Alcoholics Anonymous every day.

Palme d'Or

He was quoted by the newspaper as saying he used to drink a bottle of vodka every day but to be creative he combined the alcohol with different kinds of drugs.

""I can't recommend anyone to do the same. It is very dangerous and stupid in every way,"" he said.

The director is perhaps best known as a co-signatory of the Dogme 95 manifesto - a ""vow of chastity"" he made with three fellow Danish film-makers.

Their films, they declared, would strip away artifice by being shot on location using natural light and handheld cameras.

In 2000 Von Trier won the Palme d'Or with Dancer in the Dark, a musical starring Icelandic pop star Bjork as a woman who ends up on Death Row.

His other films include Dogville, Manderlay and 2009's Antichrist, which whipped up a furore at Cannes with its explicit sex scenes and graphic violence.

Von Trier's most recent effort, the lengthy and sexually-explicit Nymphomaniac Director's Cut - Volume I and II, has been nominated for best film at the European Film Awards.

The awards will be handed out on 13 December in Riga, Latvia, this year's European Capital of Culture.

Manchester riots: Doughnut thief jailed for 16 months,A man who helped himself to doughnuts from a Krispy Kreme shop during riots in Manchester city centre is jailed for 16 months.,,None,"Image caption Thomas Downey had spent his only £4 on tobacco

A man who helped himself to doughnuts from a Krispy Kreme shop during riots in Manchester city centre has been jailed for 16 months.

Thomas Downey, 48, was released from HMP Manchester on 9 August shortly before getting caught up in the riots.

The serial offender went to a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous before downing a bottle of sherry and stumbling into Krispy Kreme in Piccadilly Gardens.

He was caught with a box of doughnuts when 20 riot officers arrived.

Downey admitted burglary and breach of an Asbo by entering part of the city centre from which he is prohibited.

Judge Robert Atherton, sentencing at Manchester Crown Court, told him: ""You drink too much, too regularly and when in drink become threatening and abusive.""

'Expressed remorse'

The total cost of damage to the shop - which was unsecured before Downey went in for the doughnuts - was about £17,000, prosecutors said.

The court heard he had more than 100 convictions for 233 offences and had been released from prison at 19:30 BST that day.

Zoe Nield, for Downey, said her client had left jail with only £4 in his pocket.

He was not involved in rioting but took the doughnuts because he was hungry, having spent his money on tobacco, she said.

She added: ""He can't recall the events because he was drunk but he has expressed remorse.""

Among the others to be sentenced was David Swarbrick, 25, was jailed for two years after he stole £25 worth of Oil of Olay from a Quality Save store in Parker Street, which was unsecured after an earlier attack.

'Thrown away'

Swarbrick, of Aston Old Road, Openshaw, admitted burglary and breach of a suspended sentence order.

Father-of-four Anthony Winder, 38, looted the Swarovski Crystal store and smashed a display cabinet to get an ornamental dog, the court heard.

He was also jailed for two years. The judge told him he had ""made a highly respectable life"" for himself and his family, despite a difficult childhood.

""You should have been at the forefront of leading people away from such activities but you became involved,"" the judge said.

""Now you have thrown so much away.""","['store', 'jailed', 'manchester', 'unsecured', 'downey', 'riots', 'doughnut', 'told', 'spent', '16', 'doughnuts', 'went', 'thief', 'months', 'court']","Image caption Thomas Downey had spent his only £4 on tobaccoA man who helped himself to doughnuts from a Krispy Kreme shop during riots in Manchester city centre has been jailed for 16 months.

Eight unhelpful things to say to an alcoholic,It's painful to see someone you love struggle with alcohol addiction.,,None,"It's painful to see someone you love struggle with alcohol addiction.

And it's easy to get angry about how their behaviour is affecting the people around them.

But if you want to help, you need to know the right things to say.

Newsbeat asked three recovering alcoholics to explain what didn't help them, and what they wish their families had said.

1. Why do you need to drink?

""At first I'd say, 'Because I like it,'"" Tracey says.

Her husband had just left the family and she thought alcohol was helping her numb the pain.

But when her children asked her why she was drinking, she became resentful.

She says as a result she even increased the amount she was drinking.

""They were trying to be helpful but to me they weren't because I was in denial.""

But as time went on, she became scared of the addiction.

""I got more open because I was frightened, and I could say, 'I don't know how to stop any more. I need help.'""

She says it's important to try to understand the reasons behind someone's drinking problem, and try not to be judgemental.

2. Why can't you just stop?

Alcoholics can be physically addicted, meaning their body has come to rely on alcohol to feel ""normal"".

Stopping suddenly can lead to withdrawal symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations and seizures.

""I just couldn't stop. Not at the time. Medically I couldn't,"" says Tracey.

""You can go into fits if you stop just like that.""

She was drinking a bottle of vodka a night and would have panic attacks if there was no booze in the house.

""People need to understand it's an illness,"" Tracey insists.

It can take between three months and a year to fully recover from the effects of alcohol withdrawal.

Tracey managed to quit because her family took her to the GP. She spent time in hospital and was put on medication to help.

3. You're selfish

As families grow tired of an alcoholic's drinking, they can often start to criticise them more aggressively.

This made Tracey's behaviour more spiteful, she says.

""I was selfish,"" says Tracey. ""But at the time I couldn't see that.

""It's dreadful to think that's what I used to do. I should have been coming home and thinking, 'What am I going to cook [my daughter] for tea?'

""But all my mind was fixated on was coming home to have a drink.""

Ambrose, who's been off alcohol for nine months, says: ""I could see I was hurting and upsetting people.

""I couldn't cope with feeling guilty so I ended up drinking more to forget that I felt guilty.""

Tracey says it's best to avoid using combative language if you're trying to help someone with an alcohol problem.

Instead, try to be sympathetic.

""I just wanted them to say, 'Look Mum, we know you've got a problem. We're here to help you.'""

4. Don't you love us?

Tracey says her children asked her this often.

""I thought, 'What a horrible thing to say.'

""I knew I did love them. Why would it change because I've had a drink?

""But obviously I wasn't showing them.""

For Rose, who stopped drinking three years ago, it was ""nothing to do with love"".

""If I was able to have stopped of course I would have.

""It wasn't a choice. It was a necessity,"" she says.

5. How are you able to afford this?

""If I had no electricity I'd ask my mum for help to pay for more,"" remembers Rose.

""And sometimes she'd say, 'Oh - but you can afford drink.'

""Unfortunately she was probably right. But it doesn't help.""

6. Shouting and screaming

""Get yourself together"" and ""you're a mother for God's sake.""

Rose remembers these words being shouted at her but she says she only had time to reflect once the shouting stopped.

""There was silence and it gave me room to think.

""Calmly people said to me, 'We're so worried about you. You're going to die. We don't know what to do.'

""I wanted to die in my sleep. I couldn't see how I could ever stop drinking.

""But the silence let me see the pain my family were going through.""

7. We won't drink either

Rose finds it patronising when she goes for dinner with friends and someone says something like, ""none of us are going to drink either"".

""They make a huge deal about them not having alcohol. Actually it makes me feel uncomfortable.

""I'd much rather they said something like, 'Oh, do you mind if I have a drink?'

""When people are being obviously super careful it can be difficult.""

Tracey still goes to the pub with her friends but she says she would never expect them not to drink on her behalf.

8. Are you strong enough?

Since he stopped drinking Ambrose says he dislikes when people ask if he's strong enough to stay off it.

""When they ask that I think, 'Cheers mate, thanks for having faith in me.'""

He understands history may have taught people recovery can occasionally have setbacks but he says: ""It's people having negative thoughts and passing them on to me.

""It puts a negative thought in my head and I start to wonder if I'm kidding myself.""

Jail for trucker caught almost six times drink drive limit,A man who drove a 12-tonne lorry while almost six times the drink-driving limit is jailed for four months.,,None,"Image copyright Google Image caption Stirling Sheriff Court was told James Gallagher has a previous drink driving conviction

A man who drove a 12-tonne lorry while almost six times the drink-driving limit has been jailed for four months.

A court was told motorists contacted police to report James Gallagher's white Scania being driven erratically on the M80.

Gallagher, 49, was stopped by officers near Pirnhall Services, Stirling and found to be smelling strongly of alcohol.

He was also banned from driving for three years at Stirling Sheriff Court.

The court was told that Gallagher was stopped by police at 14:25 and, despite having had his last drink the previous night, was still 5.95 times the legal limit.

Gallagher, of Tillicoultry, Clackmannanshire, pleaded guilty to drink driving, and confessed to a social worker who prepared a background report that he would routinely drive his tipper truck with the same amount of alcohol in his body.

Previous conviction

The court heard he had a previous conviction for drink-driving in 1998, when he was banned for 14 months.

James McLean, defending, said his client was ashamed of his actions, and had been attending Alcoholics Anonymous.

He asked the court not to jail Gallagher, but to impose a community sentence instead.

Sheriff Wyllie Robertson told Gallagher: ""You were nearly six times the limit, and that is a significant figure from the point of view of the level of impairment.

""What is of equal concern is that you were driving an HGV, a 12-tonne tipper lorry, and you had been doing it all day, and it is clear that this alcohol level arose from alcohol you had drunk the previous evening.

""These are huge aggravations for a serious offence, and in these circumstances there is no sentence other than a custodial sentence that is appropriate.""","['stirling', 'driving', 'drink', 'alcohol', 'previous', 'caught', 'gallagher', 'sentence', 'told', 'drive', 'limit', 'times', 'court', 'jail', 'trucker']","Image copyright Google Image caption Stirling Sheriff Court was told James Gallagher has a previous drink driving convictionA man who drove a 12-tonne lorry while almost six times the drink-driving limit has been jailed for four months.

Thousands of dangerous drink-drivers are reoffenders,"Almost one in five motorists listed on an official register of the most dangerous drink-drivers has been on it before, the BBC learns through a Freedom of Information request.",,None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Anish Patel, whose wife was killed by a drink driver: ""Something has to be done""

As new figures show the number of people killed in drink-driving crashes rose by 17%, the BBC has discovered that thousands of drink-drivers are repeat offenders.

A fifth of those on a DVLA ""high-risk register"" have been on it before.

There are calls for more stringent checks before offenders are given back their licences.

The government said it had tightened up rules, and drivers now had to prove they were no longer alcohol-dependent.

Drink-drivers who are more than two and a half times over the legal limit, who have two or more drink-drive offences within a 10-year period or who refuse to give breath, blood or urine samples, are classed by the DVLA as ""high-risk offenders"".

Using the Freedom of Information Act, the BBC discovered there are currently 230,149 banned drivers on the DVLA's scheme and of these, 42,207 drivers had been on it before.

Their licences had been returned because they were considered safe to drive when their initial ban expired.

But under rules introduced in June, when a ban expires, offenders can reapply for their licence only when they have passed a medical test to prove they are no longer alcohol-dependent.

However, this will apply only to new offenders - those convicted earlier can drive after reapplying for their driving licence.

Provisional figures released on Thursday show that 280 people were killed in drink-drive accidents in 2012, an increase of about 17% compared with 2011. This accounts for 16% of all road deaths in Britain. Overall, deaths were down 8% on 2011, at 1,754.

Police and road safety campaigners say the system of dealing with drink-drivers needs to be re-examined.

'Bitter experience'

Insp Richard Auty, who has investigated collisions for the Metropolitan Police for 17 years, said he was surprised by the DVLA figure, adding that it was ""quite large"".

He expressed doubts that the new testing system would address the problem.

""I suspect from the people that I've dealt with that whilst it will deal with the worst offenders, the binge drinkers that are able to control it will clearly not turn up to a medical drunk, so it won't effectively deal with those people. So I would suggest a mandatory driving test or extended driving test before you get your licence back would be a much greater deterrent.""

In 2009, Anish Patel's wife, Catriona, 39, was killed by a serial offender while cycling to work. She was crushed under the wheels of his lorry outside Oval tube station in south London.

Image caption The driver of this lorry who killed Catriona Patel had been on a drinking binge the night before. He was jailed for seven years.

The driver had three previous drink-driving convictions, had been disqualified 20 times and had three previous convictions for reckless driving.

Mr Patel said: ""It was just a normal day and a few phone calls later and hours later your whole life gets turned upside down and changed forever. She was my best friend, she was the love of my life, she was my soulmate, we did absolutely everything together.""

He felt angry and bitter when he learned about the driver's previous convictions.

""I just thought the biggest thing that shouldn't have happened that day was him being on the road and driving a 40-tonne tipper truck fully laden through one of the busiest junctions through central London.

""These people obviously are not operating by the same rules of the vast majority of the population operate by and I think that there has to be something done about serial offenders. It is too common an occurrence that people get convicted of drink-driving and they are back on the road either illegal or unfortunately legally. ""

'Get carried away'

Johnny, a former serial drink-driver who stopped drinking through Alcoholics Anonymous, was caught three times in nine weeks.

He was banned for two years and continued to drink-drive for 15 years but was never caught again.

He said: ""I always thought of the consequences but unfortunately just the following morning. I was just going out for one or two drinks, get a bit carried away and invariably I'd end up drink-driving.

""I'm not convinced that a tougher sentence would have made any difference. How much tougher do you want it to be? You're going to lose your liberty, you're going to lose your job, you're going to lose your home. You're going to lose everything basically if you do it again. That never stopped me from driving.""

Amy Aeron-Thomas, executive director of RoadPeace, the national charity for road crash victims, said it was time to review driving bans and increase the number of breathalyser tests.

""There is public support for a five-year ban for first-time offenders. Now you are talking about repeat offenders, big-risk offenders - they deserve lengthy driving bans if not losing their licence permanently.

""We know with the decrease in road policing there are fewer breathalyser tests being given so there is a greater chance of them getting away with it.""

Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: ""Drink-drivers are a menace and it is right that we do everything we can to keep the most high-risk offenders off the road.

""That is why we have tightened up the rules which mean that they now have to take medical tests to prove they are no longer alcohol-dependent before being allowed to drive.""

'Why I drink 100 units of alcohol a week',Heavy drinkers share their boozing habits - including spending £500 a month on wine.,,None,"Image copyright Getty Images

How much alcohol do you drink?

People have been sharing their drinking habits after presenter Adrian Chiles revealed he sometimes drank more than 100 units a week - more than seven times the recommended limit.

He said drinking never affects his life and he considers himself a social drinker, not an alcoholic.

Other heavy drinkers have been speaking about their alcohol consumption.

'Do I want to stop? No'

Paul Tomlinson, 48, from Thornton-Cleveleys in Lancashire says it is ""easy to rack up drinking when you're sat at home"".

""I regularly drink 80 to 100 units a week, most of it between Friday and Sunday.

""On each night I will usually have two or three beers - sometimes alcohol free now actually - followed by a bottle of wine and then two or three large gin and tonics.

""This is roughly 16 to 18 units a night for three consecutive nights. I will then do at least two or three more bottles of wine in the week with a couple of gin and tonics again.

Image copyright Paul Tomlinson Image caption Paul Tomlinson says society primes people to drink alcohol

""Do I consider myself an alcoholic? No! Do I want to stop drinking at the level I do? Not really.

""I have a disabled son who is 24 so don't go out often and as a result drink more at home.

""I don't go to bed feeling outrageously drunk and I don't black out on the sofa.""

'£500 a month on wine'

One man, who chose to remain anonymous, says his father was an ""old fashioned"" alcoholic who started drinking in the morning - but that he is not an alcoholic.

""I find myself in the habit of putting away one and a half to two bottles of white wine every night, unless I'm really thirsty in which case it might be two and a half bottles.

""I start at 6 or 7pm, couple of glasses whilst preparing family supper, continue through PS4 ""wind down"" time, another couple of glasses.

""Then usually finish off the second bottle whilst listening to music. Tada! £500 a month on wine.

""I'm in a strange position, as I can (and do) stop when I want to - sometimes for a month or two just to prove to myself I'm not an alcoholic like my dad.

""I'll go out with my mates and not touch a drop, again - just to prove a point to myself. And yet I still drink far, far too much.

Image copyright Getty Images

""I'm rarely drunk nowadays, although obviously I still don't drive. I just wish someone would make a drink that tastes as nice as wine, without the alcohol.

""I'm currently losing weight and so have ""limited"" myself to a half to one bottle of wine a night.

""I find that the problem is the habit more than alcohol. I smoked 20 plus a day for 20 years then quit five years ago, with no patches etc.

""Never felt like a relapse, never been tempted to have 'just one'. I think alcohol is in the same category.

""Although, as I can testify with my father, the drug is insidious and rather than just kill your body, if you let it, it will kill your personality first.""

'I'm all or nothing'

Adrian Chiles' account of his alcohol consumption ""mirrors almost exactly"" how Mark Baker, 58, from North Somerset, says he drinks.

""Like him I drink about 80 to 100 units a week and have done so for many years.

""I have a slight fatty liver (as does he) but otherwise perfectly OK. I have never suffered from depression or anxiety.

""I drink mostly out of habit. I never get drunk, drink and drive, I never drink in the mornings or at lunchtime, I just like a drink in the evening to wind down and relax.

""I am an export manager so drinking is part of the territory.

Image copyright Getty Images

""Last year in October I stopped drinking for a month. I was worried that I was dependent on it.

""I found it easy to do especially as there are so many products on the market with low or no alcohol. I could still have a beer, glass of wine or even a gin and tonic. Yes, there is low alcohol spirit.

""Like Adrian, I will probably give up drinking rather than rationing it as when I have tried that in the past it never seems to work. I am definitely an all or nothing person.""

'I will try and cut down'

Annemarie McAleese, 48, from Belfast, owns her own restaurant and says she starts drinking wine when she gets home as she ""potters about"".

""On average I would drink two bottles of white wine each night, and have done for the last seven years.

""I have my own business, and work in it five or six days per week.

""After reading this article, I think now is the time to rethink my drinking habits.

""It's a very bad habit. I think I will try to cut down. I think I use owning my business as an excuse because it can be quite stressful.

""I won't watch the programme with my husband because I don't need somebody yapping in my ear 'you need to stop', I need to do this for myself.""

'High functioning alcoholic'

John, from Essex, says he considered himself a ""moderate social drinker"" until he developed liver disease.

""Then I gave up drinking altogether but the liver disease worsened leading to many hospital visits and the need for a liver transplant.

""I had never missed work or put drink ahead of all else but when I detailed out my daily drinking to numerous doctors over a nine-month period I was embarrassed to realise that I was effectively a high-functioning alcoholic.

""I am pleased to say that thanks to my organ donor I have led a healthy, happy life for the last eight years and become a grandfather three times.

""Something I would have missed if I had carried on as before.

""If Adrian's show makes anyone seriously look at the amount they drink and reduce it then he is doing a great job.

""On the subject of giving up alcohol I feel sometimes too much is made of how difficult this is, rather than concentrating on the benefits of being sober.

""Better health, better sleep, no hangovers, higher alertness and an ability to enjoy things with a clear head.""

Alcohol and health

The number of adults who say they drink alcohol is at its lowest level since surveys began in 2005, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

The NHS recommends not drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week. If you do drink that much, it is best to spread it over three or more days.

One unit of alcohol is 10ml of pure alcohol, which is equivalent to half a pint of normal-strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits.

"Ulster Bank: Man jailed for stealing £11,000 from faulty ATM","A recovering alcoholic is jailed for four months for stealing £11,000 from a faulty Ulster Bank cash machine.",,None,"Image copyright PA Image caption A prosecution lawyer told Downpatrick Crown Court that on June 22, 2012, Ulster Bank had 'experienced a computer malfunction in its system'

A recovering alcoholic has been jailed for four months for stealing £11,000 from a faulty Ulster Bank cash machine.

A judge told Peter Anthony Young, 58, of Hunter's Way, Ardglass, that he had ""deliberately taken advantage'' of the major glitch in the bank's system almost four years ago.

It meant customers could withdraw funds from ATM machines without affecting their balance.

Following a check, the bank discovered the money had been withdrawn by Young.

A prosecution lawyer told Downpatrick Crown Court that on 22 June 2012, Ulster Bank had ""experienced a computer malfunction in its system''.

""Following a check, Ulster Bank discovered that Young, who was one of its customers, had £11,000 withdrawn from his account on that day,'' said Ms Ivers.

The judge was told there had been 22 separate withdrawals of £500 on the day in question.

The prosecution lawyer said the bank made repeated attempts to contact Young without success before eventually reporting the incident to police as ""fraudulent''.

The PSNI started an investigation and Young voluntarily attended a police station and admitted making the withdrawals, telling police he had ""spent the money on drink''.

The prosecution lawyer said the accused, who was a customer of the Ulster Bank, had ""made no effort to pay back the funds'' and the outstanding balance he owed now stood at £10,908.40.

A defence lawyer described it as an ""unusual case'' and said that when Young was interviewed by police in September 2014 he made ""frank admissions'' to his crimes.

""Reading between the lines from the court papers, it appears Mr Young was in the company of other people drinking with them that day and when he was taking money out it became apparent to him and the others that there was a fault with this machine,"" he told the court.

""This was always going to come home to him.

'Downward spiral'

""He is not in the least blaming others.''

The defence lawyer said that Young's life had ""taken a downward spiral'' following the death of his mother in 1991 and said that by the age of 34 he was an alcoholic, homeless and ""living on the streets of Belfast''.

The lawyer added that the father-of-five was now a recovering alcoholic, who was attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, was part of a church group and was also attending a rehabilitation programme.

The defence lawyer said Young could be made the subject of a community order which ""would leave something hanging over his head that would remind him not to stray from the straight and narrow again''.

""I would urge the court to give him a chance to continue to improve himself,'' the lawyer added.

The judge said Young had gone to the machine on one occasion to withdraw £500 on the day in question.

""He chose to return to this machine a further 21 times to withdraw the money when he knew he did not have the funds in his account,"" he said.

""He knew full well what he was doing and he deliberately took advantage of the defective ATM.""

The judge said Young, who is living on social security benefits, had not repaid any money he had stolen from the Ulster Bank.

""I don't believe I could deal with this case by way of a suspended sentence. The least sentence I can impose is one of four months in custody.''","['prosecution', 'jailed', 'money', 'lawyer', 'man', 'day', 'judge', 'young', 'faulty', 'stealing', 'told', 'atm', '11000', 'ulster', 'court', 'bank']","Image copyright PA Image caption A prosecution lawyer told Downpatrick Crown Court that on June 22, 2012, Ulster Bank had 'experienced a computer malfunction in its system'A recovering alcoholic has been jailed for four months for stealing £11,000 from a faulty Ulster Bank cash machine.

Shot Chelsea lawyer Mark Saunders 'asked for his wife',The widow of a barrister who was shot dead by police during a stand-off tells an inquest she could have defused the situation.,,None,"Image caption Mr Saunders' family say he posed no real risk to the public

The widow of an alcoholic barrister who was shot dead by police during a stand-off told an inquest she could have defused the situation.

Mark Saunders, 32, was hit in the head and chest by five police bullets at his Chelsea home in May 2008.

Elizabeth Saunders told Westminster Coroner's Court: ""I know that Mark would never, ever have hurt me.""

Mr Saunders asked negotiators if he could speak to his wife, but she said police told her to turn her phone off.

Mrs Saunders, also a barrister at QEB chambers, said that her husband told their senior clerk he had been ""firing his gun and that the police were coming and he was in trouble"" in a phone call shortly before 1700 BST.

Blank text

She made her way home but was stopped at the police cordon. Officers then asked her to switch off her mobile phone.

She said she heard a ""lot of commotion"" but did not know her husband was dead until 2230 BST.

Later when she switched on her phone, she found a blank text from him.

Image caption Mark Saunders' family say he posed no risk to the public

Mrs Saunders said: ""That would have been the only time in our relationship that he sent me a text message and he did not get an immediate call from me saying, 'Darling, I am here'.

""That is very difficult for me, but there it is. I did not know he had called.""

She told the inquest: ""The truth of our relationship was Mark and I loved each other.

""I think he would have just said 'Darling, I am sorry'. And I would have said 'Sweetheart, it is OK. Do not worry, we will sort this out'.""

The inquest also heard that Mr Saunders had texted Alex Booth, the best man at his wedding, during the stand-off.

The message said: ""This is the end, my only friend, the end.""

Mr Booth told the court they would often quote films and music to each other, and the message appeared to be quoting from a song by The Doors used in the film Apocalypse Now.

The hearing was told Mr Saunders had been attending Alcoholics Anonymous and sought help from his GP to control his drinking.

The family law expert had been prescribed anti-depressants and had also taken cocaine in the months leading up to his death.

'Love for life'

Mrs Saunders said she thought he had been drinking heavily on the day of his killing.

She said her husband was a ""very sensitive and caring man"" with ""huge energy and love for life"".

Mrs Saunders said he had been teetotal apart from a few ""blips"".

She said: ""There were occasions, probably every three months or so, when it went wrong.""

On the day of his death Mr Saunders had been out on various errands and seemed ""very happy"".

Cab driver David Hay, who dropped him later in the day, told the inquest: ""He looked straight at me, and just said, 'I'm going to die'.""

The death of Mr Saunders, who was once in the Territorial Army, was filmed from a police helicopter.

Police had been called after neighbours saw him firing a shotgun into a neighbouring flat.

The officers say they were firing in self-defence, or to protect others.

None of them is to be prosecuted, the Crown Prosecution Service has said.

Mr Saunders' family maintain he presented no risk to the public.

Paul Gascoigne given suspended drink-driving sentence,Former footballer Paul Gascoigne is given an eight-week suspended sentence after admitting driving while over the legal alcohol limit.,,None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Paul Gascoigne arriving at Newcastle Magistrates' Court for sentencing

Former footballer Paul Gascoigne has been given a suspended prison sentence after he admitted drinking and driving.

The 43-year-old Tyneside-born former England midfielder was stopped by police in Newcastle on 8 October.

The city's magistrates' court was told that Gascoigne was more than four times the legal alcohol limit.

He was handed an eight-week sentence, suspended for a year, and banned from driving for three years. He was also given an alcohol treatment order.

The court was told Gascoigne was five weeks into a 12-week anti-drink programme in Dorset.

Gascoigne, who played top flight football for Newcastle, Tottenham, Lazio, Rangers, Everton and Middlesbrough in a career spanning nearly 20 years, also attends Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings.

I hope not to see you again District Judge Stephen Earl Profile: Paul Gascoigne

His solicitor Stephen Andrews said: ""The talk now is of an extensive and elongated period of support while not actually under the roof of the Providence Project, but certainly within easy reach, given the continued support they would propose to offer.

""Previously, it has been on his terms. He's gone in, he has used it as he saw fit and of course relapsed because he has not done the full programme.

""This time it has been on their terms.""

District Judge Stephen Earl said he believed a 12-week sentence, with a third off as credit for a guilty plea, was appropriate.

He said the sentence was suspended in recognition of Gascoigne's progress in the treatment programme.

'Toon Army'

He warned the former footballer that if he re-offended in the next 12 months, the jail term would be triggered.

District Judge Earl added: ""I hope not to see you again.""

Gascoigne made no comment when he left court, but Mr Andrews said he was relieved and that it was a ""good result"".

Outside the court well-wishers shouted, ""Toon Army never surrenders"", and he signed autographs for fans.

He then got into his lawyer's car which became stuck in heavy snow in the car park behind the court.

The vehicle - which sported a Manchester City pendant on the passenger window - was pushed free by members of the press.

Gascoigne is also due to be tried on a separate charge of drinking and driving, which he denies.

Play centre founder admits filming girls in changing rooms,"Married father-of-two Darren Johnson ""stalked"" girls changing after swimming lessons.",,None,"Image copyright Metropolitan Police/PA Wire Image caption Married father-of-two Darren Johnson filmed girls getting changed after swimming lessons

The co-founder of a children's play centre filmed youngsters undressing after swimming lessons, a court heard.

Former Eddie Catz director Darren Johnson used ""peepholes"" to film women and girls in toilets and changing rooms at a leisure centre for children.

The number of victims is not known, but a police officer involved in the case estimated it may be as many as 40.

Johnson, 51, from Putney, south-west London, admitted five counts of voyeurism over a 12-year period.

He was caught when two 14-year-old girls spotted his camera-phone from under the cubicle adjacent to them and alerted staff, Kingston Crown Court heard.

'Stalked children'

After Johnson was identified in CCTV footage, police seized two computers containing hundreds of images of women in various states of undress.

Johnson admitted voyeurism between 1 January 2005 and 5 June 2017.

Two of the charges relate to filming the 14-year-old girls, while a third relates to images of women taken under cubicles at a leisure centre.

Two more charges relate to images of women taken through ""peepholes"" in toilets and changing rooms at an Eddie Catz soft play centre.

His defence lawyer claimed Johnson had not meant to film teenagers.

However, prosecutor Lauren Sales said CCTV shows Johnson ""stalking children around the leisure centre"".

""He attended the leisure centre at times when schools have swim classes,"" she added.

""He goes up to the swimming pool, sees the kids, sees them using the facilities, stalks them to the shower area... and uses the cubicle next to them.""

Image copyright Google Image caption Johnson founded the children's soft play centre company, Eddie Catz, with his wife

Johnson, who founded Eddie Catz with his wife, resigned from the business as soon as the allegations came to light.

The company has centres in Earlsfield, Putney, Wimbledon and Newbury, as well as a presence in branches of Mothercare in Leeds, Gateshead, Manchester, Solihull and Bristol.

Defence lawyer Tom Williams said Johnson was plagued by alcohol problems and marriage troubles.

""He is truly sorry for what he has done and has done everything he can to address those things in his life which pushed him into an extremely dark place in that period,"" Mr Williams said.

Johnson has attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and classes for sex addicts since his arrest, the court heard.

Judge Andrew Campbell said Johnson would be sentenced on Wednesday.","['johnson', 'girls', 'catz', 'leisure', 'centre', 'images', 'rooms', 'filming', 'eddie', 'admits', 'changing', 'founder', 'play', 'women', 'swimming']","Former Eddie Catz director Darren Johnson used ""peepholes"" to film women and girls in toilets and changing rooms at a leisure centre for children.

Belfast court: Woman jailed for drink driving crash,"A woman who caused a head-on collision whilst drunk driving was on her way to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, Belfast Crown Court has heard.",,None,"Image caption Laganside Court was told that O'Hara caused the crash whilst on her way to an AA meeting

A woman who caused a head-on collision whilst drunk driving was on her way to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, Belfast Crown Court has heard.

Briege O'Hara, 61, from Antrim Road, Belfast, was jailed for nine months on Monday.

She was driving on the wrong side of the road on 27 August 2013, when she hit another motorist and injured him.

The court was told that she knew the man whom she injured and was ""entirely remorseful"".

A prosecuting lawyer said the crash happened at 11:30 BST on the Antrim Road.

O'Hara had driven around a bend on the wrong side of the road and the van ""didn't have a chance"" to move out of her way.

She was arrested and tests showed she had been driving whilst over the limit.

O'Hara said she could not remember the crash. She said she had taken a glass of wine and 5mgs of Diazepam before leaving the house.

She pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily injury by dangerous driving and also driving with excess alcohol.

The van driver, a man in his mid 60s, broke his sternum and left hand in the collision and lost his job as a delivery driver as a result. He was treated in hospital for his injuries.

A defence lawyer said that while the incident was ""utterly disgraceful"", his client was ""entirely remorseful"".

He said that she had spent 12 weeks in residential care for alcohol addiction problems almost immediately after causing the crash and had not taken alcohol since then.

Her lawyer said she had had a very difficult life and was emotionally fragile.

O'Hara was sentenced to 18 months. She will spend half of this time in prison, with the remaining nine months spent on supervised licence. She was also banned from driving for three years.","['jailed', 'drink', 'crash', 'months', 'woman', 'lawyer', 'wrong', 'way', 'whilst', 'belfast', 'driving', 'road', 'court', 'van']","Image caption Laganside Court was told that O'Hara caused the crash whilst on her way to an AA meetingA woman who caused a head-on collision whilst drunk driving was on her way to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, Belfast Crown Court has heard.

Production halted on Charlie Sheen sitcom after remarks,"Production of Two and A Half Men is halted after remarks by the hit US series' star, Charlie Sheen.",,None,"Image caption Sheen has also appeared in the films Wall Street and Platoon

Production of Two and A Half Men has been halted after remarks by the hit US series' star, Charlie Sheen.

Sheen slammed the programme's producer in a radio interview on Thursday.

The decision was based on the ""totality of Charlie Sheen's statements, conduct and condition"", Warner Bros Television studio and the CBS network said in a joint statement.

The 45-year-old actor has also appeared in the films Wall Street and Platoon.

Production of the show had been postponed since late January after Charlie Sheen, the son of Hollywood actor Martin Sheen, entered rehabilitation for reported drug and alcohol abuse.

The actor's publicist had said earlier on Thursday that Two and a Half Men would resume production next week when Sheen had finished his rehabilitation.

But the statement by CBS and Warner Bros Television was issued after Sheen phoned into a US radio programme to criticise the programme's co-creator Chuck Lorre, as well as Alcoholics Anonymous.

The actor - one of America's highest-paid stars - was taken to hospital in Los Angeles with severe abdominal pains late last month before entering rehab.

He filed for divorce from his third wife, Brooke Mueller, in November, citing irreconcilable differences.

In late October 2009, Sheen was accused of causing damage to a hotel room in New York. After hotel security reported he was disorderly, the actor voluntarily went with authorities for a psychiatric evaluation.","['remarks', 'warner', 'actor', 'charlie', 'television', 'street', 'production', 'radio', 'halted', 'late', 'sitcom', 'sheen', 'reported', 'wall']","Image caption Sheen has also appeared in the films Wall Street and PlatoonProduction of Two and A Half Men has been halted after remarks by the hit US series' star, Charlie Sheen.

Michael Le Vell: Street star's 'demons' laid bare in trial,"Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell is cleared of child sex offences, but his trial revealed the darker side of his personal life.",,None,"Image caption Michael Le Vell was described in court as a ""heavy drinker [who] went out most nights""

Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell has been cleared of child sex abuse offences after a trial at Manchester Crown Court that lasted more than a week. On the steps of the court, after the jury had found him not guilty of 12 charges, his relief was obvious.

""I might go and have a drink now, believe it or not,"" was how Mr Le Vell finished his brief statement to the gathered media.

It was a remark that raised a laugh with his supporters but, as had been clear in the trial, it pointed to a dark side of the star's private life.

The 48-year-old actor, tried under his real name Michael Turner, had confessed his inner demons - alcoholism and adultery - during his time in the witness box.

'Troubled life'

The indication is clear that he is going back to Coronation Street and why not? Nigel Pivaro, Ex-Coronation Street actor

However, the star who plays Kevin Webster in the ITV soap maintained throughout he had never sexually assaulted or raped a child.

The judge had warned jurors not to confuse the man in the dock with his TV role as the car mechanic he has played for 30 years, watched by nine million viewers a week.

Mr Le Vell told the court his role had allowed him to live a ""luxury, charmed"" existence, but that on-screen fame hid what prosecutors said was a ""troubled"" life.

During cross-examination, he admitted he was an alcoholic and for 30 years had been ""drinking about seven or eight pints a night"" in the pub.

He told the court he had attended Alcoholics Anonymous ""one or two times"" but had given up on each occasion after just a few weeks.

In court, Mr Le Vell claimed his drinking was the result of his ""working-class mentality"" and confessed he had only been able to continue acting because his job had ""cocooned"" him.

'One-night stands'

The verdict came at the end of a trial which had seen the prosecutor remind the jury the case concerned neither Coronation Street's Kevin Webster nor Michael Le Vell.

Image caption Mr Le Vell has played garage mechanic Kevin Webster in the popular soap since 1983

""The man on trial is Michael Turner,"" chief prosecutor Eleanor Laws QC said.

During his trial, the jury heard how Mr Le Vell had cheated on his wife while she was undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer, in a parallel with his on-screen character, and he had had a string of one-night stands.

By coincidence, his character Kevin Webster had an affair with a character called Molly Dobbs while his on-screen wife, Sally Webster, developed breast cancer.

Such plot developments came a long time after Mr Turner started acting at school, aged 12, later becoming a member of Oldham Theatre Workshop, adopting the stage name of Le Vell along the way.

In 1981, he got his break, joining Coronation Street in a minor role for a few episodes. Two years later, he was cast as mechanic Kevin Webster.

As producers sought to win younger audiences Kevin and his two mates - bad-boy Terry Duckworth (played by Nigel Pivaro) and dreamer with intellectual pretensions Curly Watts (Kevin Kennedy) became a hit with fans.

Star's personal drama

Only Mr Le Vell has lasted in ""The Street"" and fans of the soap opera have followed his stormy relationship with Sally, played by Sally Dynevor.

Image caption Mr Le Vell's trial lasted seven days and ended with his acquittal on all charges

Such was his prominence, he had a major part in 2010's live 50th anniversary episode, which featured a fatal tram crash in Weatherfield, with his performance leading to a Best Actor nomination at the 2011 British Soap Awards.

Within months of that on-screen drama though, Mr Le Vell was dealing with his own crisis as he was arrested over child sex allegations.

He ""strenuously"" denied the claims and, after considering the case, the Crown Prosecution Service made the decision not to bring charges against him, in January 2012.

At the time, Mr Le Vell praised Greater Manchester Police for a ""fair, thorough and independent investigation"", adding that he was ""delighted to be completely exonerated"" by the decision to take no further action.

A year later however, the principal legal adviser to the Director of Public Prosecutions overturned the decision and brought a prosecution case against him.

'He's been exonerated'

Again, Mr Le Vell denied the accusations and said they were ""an absolute pack of lies"" which he would ""fight vigorously"".

During the trial, the prosecution put it to Mr Le Vell his witness box performance was just an act.

But a jury of eight women and four men did not believe he was acting and the actor left the court a free man.

His on-screen and off-screen friend Mr Pivaro sees no reason why Mr Le Vell cannot resume his Coronation Street career.

""I think the indication is clear that he is going back to Coronation Street and why not? He's been exonerated,"" said Mr Pivaro.

""We'll see, but let's face it, who amongst us can say that we are whiter than white, squeaky clean?

Stafford bishop accuses government over alcohol abuse,"The Bishop of Stafford hits out at the government for ""doing little"" to address the problem of alcohol abuse.",,None,"Image caption In January, ministers unveiled plans to set a minimum price for alcohol in England and Wales.

The Bishop of Stafford has criticised the government for ""doing little"" to prevent alcohol abuse.

The Rt Rev Geoff Annas has described alcohol misuse as ""one of the major sins of our time"".

Writing in a pastoral letter, published in parish magazines across the Diocese of Lichfield, he called for a ""seismic shift"" in attitudes towards drinking.

The government has said it is tackling alcohol-related crime ""at its source"" through a variety of measures.

He said charities were left to tackle the effects of ""this drug abuse"", with government action not going far enough.

'Major sin'

In January, ministers unveiled plans to set a minimum price for alcohol in England and Wales.

They said banning shops and bars from selling drinks for less than the tax paid on them would cut crime and set a ""base price"" for the first time.

It works out at 38p for a can of weak lager and £10.71 for a litre of vodka.

In the letter, Mr Annas said: ""One definition of 'sin' is anything that comes between us and God and makes us less than the person God created us to be.

""Alcohol abuse is one of the major 'sins' of our time - and it is one that governments do very little to prevent.

""Instead, it is left to amazing organisations like Alcoholics Anonymous or in the inspirational O'Connor Gateway Charitable Trust, of which I am proud to be a trustee, to tackle the effects of this drug abuse.""

'Drink at home'

""Binge-drinking"" was not the fault of pub and nightclub owners, he said, nor was it down to an extension in opening hours.

""The extension of the licensing laws means that they can stay open later but in reality many [people] now do not even arrive until 11 at night,"" said Mr Annas.

""Prior to this they drink in their own homes, consuming alcohol which they have purchased very cheaply in their local supermarket or corner shop.

""The government has introduced minimum pricing but the level it has been set is derisory.""

A Home Office spokesman said the government was tackling alcohol related crime at its source by taking tough action against irresponsible premises, giving communities a chance to have a say over licensing and allowing councils to charge more for late licences.

""And we haven't just stood by while suppliers let drink be sold so cheaply that it leads to drunken violence, we've taken steps to ensure that by the end of the year the sale of alcohol below cost is banned,"" the spokesman said.","['abuse', 'alcohol', 'accuses', 'tackling', 'minimum', 'set', 'stafford', 'spokesman', 'source', 'price', 'tackle', 'crime', 'unveiled', 'bishop']","Image caption In January, ministers unveiled plans to set a minimum price for alcohol in England and Wales.

At that time Jan was drinking about two bottles of wine a night.

Before then, she says she drank sensibly, in order to wind down from her job as a senior executive for a major oil company.

""I used alcohol as an emotional crutch,"" Jan explained. ""It started off as just a glass of wine after work and it turned into two bottles.

""I'd have cleaned a whole football stadium with a toothbrush if it would tell me why this was happening to me at the age of 40.""

Before being sent to prison she sought treatment for her alcoholism at a private clinic, and was sober when she was behind bars.

While serving her sentence at HMP Styal in Cheshire she helped others who were struggling to cope with life in prison and, as a result, gained a great deal of respect from other inmates.

And since her release she has been helping others battle addiction in Greater Manchester, saying she ""now has a better understanding of herself"".

""And I NEVER think of having a drink.""

Amsterdam alcoholics paid in beer for collecting litter,A group of alcoholics is being paid in beer to clean the streets of Amsterdam. Anna Holligan joined the alcoholics on litter collection duties.,,None,"Image caption Collecting litter on Amsterdam's streets is a way to raise money legally

Alcoholics are being paid in beer to clean the streets of Amsterdam as part of a project partly funded by the Dutch government - the organisers think other countries should abandon ""old-fashioned political correctness"" and adopt the same approach.

Rene scours the streets, grasping at discarded wrappers.

His movements are fuelled by a tangible pride. It is an unfamiliar emotion for a man whose alcohol addiction has cost him so much.

""I have four children and three ex-wives, but alcohol has finished everything. I don't see them, they don't know where I am, or if I am alive. Now I have only him. He is there for 30 years, when times are good and bad, he is always there,"" he says, referring to his habit.

His affectionate gaze travels downwards. It rests on an aluminium can.

Chronic alcoholics have congregated inside a communal space, commandeered by the Rainbow Group. It is a private but primarily government-funded company, which helps those struggling to cope due to homelessness, drug abuse or alcoholism.

A gas heater emanates warmth; someone hums along to the theme tune from Armageddon.

Rene, 52, has just cracked open his third can of the day. It has just gone 11:30 in the morning.

Image caption Rene has four children and three ex-wives but now he is devoted to alcohol

He is one of 20 alcoholics who have joined this initiative. They arrive at 09:00 and work until 15:00. They take extended breaks for beer, cigarettes and a hot lunch, all provided free of charge.

The distinctive aroma of stamppot, a traditional Dutch vegetable stew, wafts through from the kitchen.

The air is hazy with smoke and camaraderie; another pop anthem fills the room with nostalgia.

""They like to cook and you see qualities they didn't even know they had,"" says Janet van de Noord, who runs the Rainbow Group's litter project.

'Cost-effective'

""It's quite difficult to get these people off the alcohol completely. We have tried everything else. Now this is the only thing that works. We might not make them better, but we are giving them a better quality of life and it's better for the neighbourhood, they're giving something back to society.""

Inside an oversized garden shed, decorated with Ajax football paraphernalia, about 6,000 cans of beer are stacked in crates.

The Rainbow Group is reluctant to say exactly how much the Dutch government pays towards the free beer, cautious of generating any negative publicity that might jeopardise their funding.

But Ms van de Noord argues it is a cost-effective way to tackle the impact of alcoholism. ""If people are being arrested, it also costs society a lot of money. So this can only be a good thing. I don't see why other countries wouldn't want to do it.""

When I asked other Dutch people about the project they all spoke in favour of it.

Ten minutes' walk from the now litter-free streets lies Amsterdam's Oosterpark.

Image caption Oosterpark is no longer strewn with litter but some alcoholics have not been persuaded to give up their park benches

Fountains propel shimmering bursts of water; leaves create an autumnal collage on the path.

This slice of Dutch life is interrupted by a man staggering towards us. ""Mooooi!"" (""beautiful"") he says, greeting us with a sleazy smile. But he quickly makes it clear that he and his friends do not wish to be interviewed.

He is one of the remaining alcoholics who have not been persuaded to abandon their park benches.

Since the street-cleaning programme started 12 months ago, local police have received fewer reports of stabbings and muggings in the park. And all of the residents we spoke to said they were happy with the government supporting this unconventional approach.

Instead of being ostracised by society, the alcoholics' needs appear to have been incorporated into the Dutch healthcare system.

The Rainbow Group is optimistic their success so far will attract more funding and help them to reach the unreachable. Other cities in the Netherlands are now considering introducing similar schemes.

Floor van Bakkum of Amsterdam's Jellinek anti-addiction clinic says the project is a good way to deal with ""a very problematic group - it's kind of harm reduction"". She likened it to giving carefully monitored methadone or heroin doses to chronic heroin addicts.

""It might help them to do something else with their life. You always have to monitor such a project, so it shouldn't attract new alcoholics - it's not an open invitation to drink in Oosterpark."" She said such a scheme would be inappropriate for alcoholics who still live at home and have a job.

'Unchangeable reality'

Back on litter duty, Rene tells me about his past life - expensive cars, extensive travel and some details best not shared. But, he insists, he is happier now, with nothing.

He detects our incredulity: ""You don't believe me? Trust me, if I could have my life again I would give it all up for this.

""I know he will never expect anything from me or let me down. Now I am free,"" he says, referring to the drink habit.

Some might wonder, how free can an addict be?

But the founders of this project treat this addiction as an ""unchangeable reality"" and tackle it using the only device that is guaranteed to connect with the patients.

""I come for the beer. If there was no beer then why would I come?"" says Rene.

Regardless of their motivations, Rene and his friends are making a positive difference in a community where they were once despised.

""It's true,"" Rene concedes, acknowledging the irony. ""They used to treat us like garbage - and now we are picking up their garbage, we are not the garbage anymore.""","['litter', 'rainbow', 'paid', 'life', 'amsterdam', 'rene', 'group', 'project', 'alcoholics', 'dutch', 'beer', 'streets', 'collecting']","Chronic alcoholics have congregated inside a communal space, commandeered by the Rainbow Group.

Would-be cleaner Denise Gough reprises polished performance,"As the National Theatre's People, Places and Things transfers to the West End, audiences have another chance to see Denise Gough's performance that could win her an Olivier award next month.",,None,"Image copyright Johan Persson Image caption Denise Gough as Emma in People, Places and Things

Denise Gough's role as a recovering addict in the National Theatre's People, Places and Things was one of the theatrical highlights of 2015. As the play transfers to the West End, audiences have another chance to see the performance that could win her an Olivier award next month.

What a difference a year makes.

At the beginning of 2015, Denise Gough almost quit acting. She couldn't make ends meet.

""I had a year out of work before this job,"" explains the Irish actress. ""I applied to be a cleaner this time last year. That's not joking. That's the truth for many jobbing actors and actresses.

""It would be lovely if we were all in a position to say it's vulgar to talk about money, but most of us have to talk about it because we can't pay our rent when we are out of work.""

As things turned out, Gough didn't get the cleaning job. But she did land the lead role in Duncan Macmillan's new play, People, Places and Things. Her performance was described as ""career-changing"", ""Class-A"" and ""emotionally shattering"".

Directed by Jeremy Herrin, the play was a sellout at the National's Dorfman Theatre last year. It begins with Gough's character Emma having a meltdown during a production of Chekhov's The Seagull. Soon she's in rehab and on a 12-step programme to tackle her addiction to drink and drugs.

Gough won the Critics' Circle best actress award for the role in January and was nominated in the same category at last year's Evening Standard theatre awards, where she was beaten by Nicole Kidman for her role in Photograph 51.

Gough and Kidman go head to head again at the Olivier awards on 3 April in a best actress field that also includes Gemma Arterton (Nell Gwynn), Janet McTeer (Les Liaisons Dangereuses) and Lia Williams (Oresteia).

People, Places and Things has four Olivier nominations in total - including best new play.

Image copyright Johan Persson Image caption People, Places and Things has four nominations at this year's Olivier Awards

So how ""career-changing"" has it been for Gough?

""What this has done has changed the level that I'm at,"" she says. ""I had never worked at the National before and now I can talk about projects that I want to do.""

Also important to her is the type of role it is. ""This character is indicative of the kind of parts we need for women on stage - and on film and TV. A woman that is not an appendage to a man.

""After a while it gets tiresome falling in love over and over on stage. This part for me is such a fantastic addition to the canon of parts that will now be available for young women to play.""

Gough leans in, speaking quickly as she warms to her theme. ""A young guy came up to me about a month after our play finished [at the National]. He said he went to see our play and the day after he went to his first AA [Alcoholics Anonymous] meeting and he's been clean and sober since.

""I know that we're always talking about theatre having the power to change lives, but it really does. I'm proud to be part of something where I'm saying something more than, 'Aren't I pretty in a dress?' I'm not just wafting around the stage.""

She pauses, and then adds with a smile: ""Although I will be wafting around the stage in other productions - just not this one.""

Gough is a supporter of the 50/50 by 2018 campaign which wants to see women represented on screen, in television and theatre in equal numbers to men.

""We are 50% of the population and yet in film less than a third of the speaking characters are female. That has to change. I think of my niece. I want her to watch things and be able to go to the theatre and see herself on stage.

""The conversation is starting and it needs to keep going. The more represented we are the more we can address the gender pay gap.""

Image copyright Johan Persson Image caption The play begins with Gough's character Emma having a stage meltdown during a production of Chekhov's The Seagull

In 2014, Gough played Julia alongside Gemma Arterton in The Duchess of Malfi at the new Sam Wanamaker Playhouse at Shakespeare's Globe. Her previous London theatre credits include Jesus Hopped the A Train, Six Characters in Search of an Author and As You Like It.

She won the Critics' Circle Award in 2012 for most promising newcomer for Desire Under the Elms at the Lyric Hammersmith.

""I said in my speech at the time I'd been around for about 12 years!"" recalls Gough.

""I have been thinking about that a lot. If that award had happened when I was a newcomer at 23 I don't think I'd have been ready for any of that. I'm having a tiny taste of attention around my work since last year. I don't know how really young people deal with that.

""I'm very glad to be mid-30s and a bit more grounded. It's very seductive and you can become a bit of an arse if you're not careful.""

She offers an anecdote about why she'll resist the trappings of fame. ""I went home recently and a magazine on which I'm the front cover was in the bidet in my parents' bathroom.

""Not on it - in it! That is why I will never forget where I've come from.""

"When the US president travels, the world stands still",Life in a security bubble is necessary for the president – and claustrophobic. Here’s an insider’s account.,,None,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Not quite a simple walk in the park when Dad is the president of the United States

US President Barack Obama pines for the moment when he can leave the security bubble. After 24 hours inside it, I can see why.

Mr Obama and his daughter Sasha, 14, walk across a tarmac in New York on Friday. He taps her shoulder and points towards Manhattan, showing her the world, or at least his version of it.

What a place.

They fly on Air Force One to one of New York's airports - and minutes later arrive by helicopter in Manhattan.

Streets are blocked off, and their motorcade glides to the Upper East Side. They run red lights - at least 26 over the weekend. Along the way people cheer. At one point a woman in a flowery sundress holds up a handmade sign: ""FREE HUGS"".

It's a New York fantasy, one of the perks of Mr Obama's job. He travels in a security zone, a ""bubble"" as it's known - a tightly managed network of aircrafts, vehicles and communication that lets him move easily around the world.

Image caption At a briefing Mr Obama says he likes to travel when he's free to go where he wants

The bubble provides safety, but it's confining. In a recent briefing he sounded wistful about an upcoming trip to Kenya, his father's homeland. He made it clear he'd rather go without security restrictions.

""I'll be honest with you, visiting Kenya as a private citizen is probably more meaningful to me than visiting as president,"" Mr Obama said. ""Because I can actually get outside of a hotel room or a conference centre.""

He still has 18 months left in the bubble, though. For that reason it's worth looking at the experience - and considering what it means in terms of his worldview.

The presidential bubble is thick - and pricey. Mr Obama rides in the motorcade in a limousine known as the Beast, which is designed to withstand bullets and chemical attacks.

Mr Obama flies on a Boeing 747 jet that costs $180,000 (£116,000) per hour to operate - and can be refuelled in the middle of a flight. Electronic equipment on board is designed to withstand all kinds of duress, including force from an electromagnetic pulse, according to White House officials.

On the aircraft Mr Obama has a suite with its own bathroom, as well as an office and a conference room. He has access to classified material, and he can communicate with military officials if the US is under attack or is facing another kind of emergency.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Obama shows his daughter around New York - under tight security

There is a saying in the UK that everything smells like fresh paint to the Queen because wherever she goes, things are done up. Here in the US presidents are treated like royalty.

When you climb onto Air Force One, it smells like leather. The seats are business-class sized, even in the back.

I'm a new ""supplementary"" member of the ""travel pool"", a group of journalists who accompany Mr Obama on trips so they can report on what's euphemistically known as a ""transformative moment"" - for example, if the president gets shot. It also gives reporters a chance to experience in a visceral way presidential life on the road.

As we get settled, a flight attendant brings out cool white towels and a basket with grapes, bananas and oranges.

Almond Joy and Baby Ruth candy bars are displayed on a table near a row of magazines in white binders. I put a box of M&M's with a presidential seal in my bag.

Two cameramen watch golf on television. ""Atlantic City,"" says one, looking out of the window. ""It's much cleaner from up here.""

Image copyright AP

Everything in the bubble, including the Jersey shore, looks scrubbed.

Even my colleagues and I are ""clean"", since we've been ""wanded"" (swept by hand-held metal detectors) and inspected by bomb-sniffing German shepherds.

Once you're in the bubble, you can't chat with those who aren't ""clean"".

Image copyright AFP

This keeps the president safe. It also cuts you off from the world - and shows the cloistered nature of the one he inhabits.

Mr Obama has to stoop slightly when he gets on board the helicopter in New York so he doesn't bump his head.

Afterwards my colleagues and I head across the tarmac to an Osprey aircraft, propellers spinning.

The gusts of air are hot and fierce, and I almost lose my footing. The aircraft shakes in the air, and you can feel it vibrate in your throat. I see a red buoy in churning water, like a fragment from a Turner painting, and we fly over South Street Seaport.

FDR Drive on the east side of Manhattan is closed down for our motorcade. Traffic is blocked for miles.

""Wave like the queen,"" a friend in Boston had advised me.

Police line the streets on the Upper East Side, where Mr Obama attends a Democratic fundraiser. Nearby a mailbox has a padlock and a red sign: ""This collection box has been locked."" This makes it harder to stuff it with explosives.

Image caption In New York Mr Obama is protected by police officers - and dump trucks

In other places, dump trucks block the streets. Gravel is piled in the back of one truck marked ""sanitation"".

The following morning the president is chewing gum on a walk near Central Park's Sheep Meadow. ""We love you, Obama,"" someone calls out.

Secret Service officers wade through the grass, checking for bombs and assassins.

Afterwards Mr Obama goes to a Broadway play.

A worker from a nearby French restaurant says they closed for a couple hours because of the security. ""Not a big deal,"" he says, adding they haven't lost much business. ""One or two tables.""

A lanky man named Michael, who's carrying an iced coffee, walks up. A police officer stops him. ""I'm trying to get to a place upstairs,"" Michael says.

""An AA meeting,"" he tells me, referring to Alcoholics Anonymous, afterwards. ""I happen to be in the wrong place at the right time,"" he says. Like others in New York, he takes it in his stride.

Image copyright AP

For the president, though, the bubble is more than an inconvenience.

After six years in the bubble, he's been accused of showing impatience with those who disagree with him, especially when they work on Capitol Hill.

When making a case for the Iran deal, he says, dismissively, to members of Congress - ""read the agreement"".

The bubble makes things worse. You're surrounded by people who are pre-screened and see the world the way you do.

Image copyright AP

After the show he rides through Times Square. Hundreds of people are cheering, but the motorcade windows are rolled up. The world is muffled and distant.

You can see the crowds, but you can't hear them. You simply float by.","['motorcade', 'travels', 'bubble', 'caption', 'president', 'copyright', 'obama', 'stands', 'security', 'mr', 'world', 'york']","""I'll be honest with you, visiting Kenya as a private citizen is probably more meaningful to me than visiting as president,"" Mr Obama said.

Brothers jailed for East Kilbride text mistake killing,Two brothers who killed a local football referee at his home in Lanarkshire are each jailed for 10 years.,,None,"Image caption Christopher and Robert Abraham admitted killing David Linning

Two brothers have each been jailed for 10 years for killing a man they thought had assaulted their mother.

Christopher and Robert Abraham, aged 26 and 20, attacked local football referee David Linning, 65, at his home in East Kilbride in Lanarkshire last December.

The assault happened after they received a text from their mother, who was in a relationship with Mr Linning, saying she had a ""sore face"".

The brothers later learned she had tripped and fallen while drunk.

Mr Linning was punched, kicked and slashed on the face with a knife during the attack.

His body was not found until two days later when a friend came to collect him to referee a football match in the town.

The brothers, who are the sons of former Radio Clyde presenter Mr Abie, were sentenced at the High Court in Edinburgh.

He was so helpful he was trying to help the two guys who killed him to get off the drink Billy Linning, Victim's son

They had earlier admitted a charge of culpable homicide.

Judge Lady Stacey told them: ""What you did that day was wicked.

""You went to the home of a man in his 60s when you were both fuelled by drink and, as you well know, drink is no excuse.

""You then proceeded to attack him. Two young men attacking an older man.""

Lady Stacey noted that both Abraham brothers had expressed remorse but added: ""No remorse you can now express can do anything to take away the anguish that Mr Linning's family - his large family - must feel because of what you did.""

Speaking after the sentencing Mr Linning's son Billy, 37, said the family was relieved the case was over.

Well-known figure

He added: ""We would just like to say we are very happy with the outcome.

""It has been absolutely horrific. No two days are the same for any of us. Everyone is totally devastated and will be for many many years to come.""

His son also told how Mr Linning, a dedicated volunteer with Alcoholics Anonymous, had been trying to help his killers overcome their problems with alcohol.

Image caption Mr Linning was found dead in his East Kilbride home

He said: ""He was so helpful he was trying to help the two guys who killed him to get off the drink.""

Mr Linning was a well-known figure around East Kilbride as a result of 30 years refereeing amateur football and hundreds of mourners attended his funeral.

In court defence lawyers described how the Abraham family had been blighted by alcohol and how at the time of the killing the brothers were homeless due to their drinking.

Defence QC Ian Duguid said if those involved had been sober, proper explanations could have been provided.

Lady Stacey said the brothers, who have a string of minor convictions, had been judged to be a high risk and made an order extending their licence conditions, after release, by two years.","['jailed', 'kilbride', 'abraham', 'east', 'trying', 'brothers', 'mistake', 'stacey', 'mr', 'linning', 'family', 'help', 'killing', 'text']","Image caption Christopher and Robert Abraham admitted killing David LinningTwo brothers have each been jailed for 10 years for killing a man they thought had assaulted their mother.

Shot barrister Mark Saunders' 20-year alcohol struggle,"Mark Saunders, the barrister shot dead by police marksmen, was a ""gutsy and polished"" courtroom opponent - but had his own two-decade struggle with alcohol.",,None,"Image caption Mr Saunders ended two months of sobriety the day before he died

In the crucible of the courtroom, he was an impressive figure.

Described in one directory of lawyers as ""popular, gutsy and polished"", Oxford graduate Mark Saunders fought on behalf of celebrity clients in high-profile and often acrimonious divorce cases.

But for nearly 20 years, he was struggling to control his alcohol intake.

It was following one heavy afternoon binge in the spring of 2008 that 32-year-old Mr Saunders found himself with a bottle of wine in one hand and a shotgun in the other, firing from the window of his £2m flat in Chelsea.

Police said they feared for their safety and the public's. On Thursday an inquest jury agreed that they had lawfully killed Mr Saunders.

When Mr Saunders began drinking at the age of 13, it was not to escape the reality of a sad and deprived life. Rather, it was in the surroundings of his private school in Cheshire.

After gaining his law degree from Christ Church College, Oxford, and serving with the Territorial Army, he joined the respected QEB Chambers in central London.

But while his profession career soared, his descent into alcohol abuse accelerated.

'Out of control'

By 2005 - three years before his death - Mr Saunders was drinking to excess most nights.

He himself admitted he was ""out of control"".

Some weeks he would drink the equivalent of four bottles of spirits. That year, he received a police caution for being drunk and disorderly.

His wife of two years, Elizabeth, also a barrister, told the inquest her husband was a ""sensitive"" man with a ""huge energy and love for life"". They were, she said, ""very much in love"".

Image caption Mr Saunders' marriage to Elizabeth was strained by his drinking

But their marriage was considerably strained by his drinking.

""I know he contacted Alcoholics Anonymous and went there on three or four occasions,"" she told the inquest jury. ""But he felt it wasn't for him, and it didn't work out.

""What Mark wanted to do was control the drinking, to be able to be a social drinker. There were occasions, probably every three months or so, when it went wrong.""

Mr Saunders' best friend Alex Booth often saw what happened when it did go wrong.

""He completely lost touch with reality,"" he said in a statement.

Mr Booth explained how his friend had ended up in casualty on several occasions, and while drinking he would be ""in a fantasy world, he wouldn't respond or engage with you"".

That fantasy world was often induced by cocaine as well as alcohol.

Tests revealed Mr Saunders had used the drug regularly in the six months before his death - although not within the last 12 hours of his life. His wife knew nothing of his drug habit.

Mr Saunders did recognise he had a problem and sought help. To stabilise his mood swings, he was prescribed the antidepressant Prozac.

In 2006, a psychiatrist examined him and warned that if he did not ""abstain completely from all mind-altering substances"" he could find himself being killed in a fight.

'Bulging eyes'

The other fear, according to medical notes, was that Mr Saunders would commit suicide if a period of depression and an alcohol binge coincided.

In February 2008, he told his wife he was giving up drinking for good. He was sober for the next two months. On the evening of 5 May, he had one glass of wine.

The following day would be Mr Saunders' last.

It is unclear at what point in the afternoon he began drinking, but by the time a taxi driver dropped him off near his home at about 1600 BST, it was evident that he was drunk.

Image caption Mr Saunders was shot as he levelled his shotgun from his flat window

Blood tests would later reveal him to be three times over the drink-drive limit.

David Hay, the taxi driver, said: ""At that point he turned back round and I gave him his change and he was looking straight at me and just said: 'I'm going to die'.""

""When he looked at me his eyes were large and bulging. I could see the terror in his eyes.""

Half an hour later, Mr Saunders loaded the shotgun he legally owned and fired the first shots from his kitchen window, triggering the five-hour standoff with armed officers of the Metropolitan Police's CO19 firearms unit.

When the fatal shots were fired at half past 2130 BST, Mr Saunders was alone.

Police had refused his wish to talk to his family - fearing he wanted to say goodbye and take his life.

Rapist Robert Foye has minimum prison sentence halved,A man who raped a schoolgirl while on the run from prison has his minimum sentenced halved by appeal judges.,,None,"Image caption Foye raped the schoolgirl while on the run from Castle Huntly prison

A man who raped a schoolgirl while on the run from prison has had his minimum sentenced halved by appeal judges.

Robert Foye was jailed for a minimum of nine years over the attack on the 16-year-old in August 2007.

However, minimum sentencing guidelines were changed following successful appeals earlier this year by Foye and paedophile Morris Petch.

Under new guidelines for discretionary life sentences, Foye, 32, will serve a minimum of four-and-a-half years.

Scottish Conservative justice spokesman John Lamont said the public would be ""aghast"" at the decision.

Scottish Labour's justice spokeswoman Johann Lamont said the public would be ""horrified"" that Foye could be considered for parole after such a short time in prison.

'Appalling crime'

Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill said he planned to bring forward changes in the law this year which would address the issues raised in the judgement.

""I respect the decision of the court - but I am aware that many people will be concerned that the minimum punishment part in this case has been reduced,"" he said.

""It was a truly appalling crime that Robert Foye committed.""

Following his conviction, Foye's defence lawyer appealed against the way trial judge Lady Smith had arrived at her decision on the minimum jail term to be served.

In March, following an appeal by Foye and Petch, judges overruled previous guidelines for setting the punishment part of discretionary life sentences and orders for lifelong restriction.

After hearing Foye's appeal, based on the revised guidelines, judges Lord Osborne, sitting with Lords Woolman and Wheatley said he can now make a bid for release after serving four-and-a-half years.

Guilty plea

In the written ruling, Lord Osborne said it may be of some comfort to those concerned that, after that time, Foye would only be freed if the parole board were satisfied he no longer posed a threat to the public.

Orders for lifelong restriction (OLR) - the kind of life sentence imposed on Foye in October 2008 - were introduced five years ago.

Since then, no prisoner given an OLR has been freed, no matter how short their so-called punishment part, or minimum sentence.

Foye, who admitted raping the schoolgirl, had been on the run for almost a week when he carried out the attack.

He had been allowed out of Castle Huntly open prison, near Dundee, to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

Foye, then 28, had lived rough in woods, drinking heavily, before he seized the girl in broad daylight as she returned from Cumbernauld town centre after collecting new contact lenses on 24 August 2007.

It later emerged that Foye had absconded from the open prison on a previous occasion in 2005.","['robert', 'appeal', 'minimum', 'short', 'prison', 'life', 'sentence', 'halved', 'punishment', 'schoolgirl', 'run', 'rapist', 'foye', 'guidelines']","Image caption Foye raped the schoolgirl while on the run from Castle Huntly prisonA man who raped a schoolgirl while on the run from prison has had his minimum sentenced halved by appeal judges.

Lindsay Lohan's chequered life in the spotlight,"As actress Lindsay Lohan is given a prison sentence for probation violation, a look at the Hollywood star's career and troubled life lived in the spotlight.",,None,"Image caption Good times, bad times: Lindsay Lohan receives an award in 2004 and learns of her prison term in 2010

The latest chapter in Hollywood actress Lindsay Lohan's chequered life was, like many others, played out in front of the camera.

The 24-year-old wept into her lawyer's shoulder in a Los Angeles courtroom as she was handed a 90-day prison sentence for probation violation, relating to a drugs charge dating back to 2007.

Lohan's life in front of the lens began at a very early age.

Born Lindsay Dee Lohan in the Bronx, New York, on 2 July, 1986, she became a child model at the age of three, appearing in Vogue, Elle and a string of television commercials for the likes of Pizza Hut and The Gap.

Image caption Lohan shot to fame as a fresh-faced Disney film star

By the age of 10, she had landed a role in US soap opera Another World, a fertile breeding ground for new talent, which also give early roles to Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt.

Lohan made her feature film debut just a year later in squeaky clean Disney hit The Parent Trap.

Her life in film progressed smoothly and wholesomely, with critically-approved comedy roles in Freaky Friday, teen hit Mean Girls and Herbie Fully Loaded adding to her profile.

Annus horribilis

A fresh-faced Lohan picked up an impressive clutch of Teen Choice and MTV Movie Award gongs.

She branched out in 2004, becoming the youngest host of the MTV award ceremony, and developed an increasingly high profile away from the confines of Hollywood's film sets.

Her apparent weight loss and a string of car accidents created tabloid headlines, and the paparazzi began to trail the young star around Los Angeles.

Lohan, meanwhile, continued to diversify. She had sung the closing song in Disney's remake of Freaky Friday, which resulted in a record contract.

Her debut album, Speak, was released in 2004 and made it to number four in the US album chart.

Image caption Lohan (left) won high praise for her role in fish-out-of-water high school comedy Mean Girls

Her follow-up a year later also proved a hit, and was a more soul-searching, confessional record about her relationship with her family, which she admitted had been a difficult one.

Songwriting, Lohan said, was a way of finding escape from the increasing pressures of her life in the Hollywood goldfish bowl.

Cameo roles followed in more adult-orientated films, including A Prairie Home Companion and Bobby - but Lohan's reputation for enjoying the high life grew in 2006 when she was rebuked for late arrivals on the set of the film Georgia Rules.

The film's producer suggested in a letter, leaked to the press, that the actress's ""heat exhaustion"" was simply the result of ""ongoing all night heavy partying"".

She began to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and admitted herself to a rehabilitation clinic in early 2007 - in what proved to be an annus horribilis for the star.

Lohan was arrested twice for driving and drug offences and had two more stints in rehab. A jail sentence was imposed but she spent only 84 minutes behind bars, and was forced to visit a mortuary to learn the impact of drink-driving.

While her personal life was splashed across the front pages, her film career was hitting a low point.

Grisly psychological thriller I Know Who Killed Me was mauled by the critics - The New York Post branded it ""sleazy, inept and worthless - and Lohan was given the dubious honour of a Razzie award for worst performance.

Image caption Lohan's liaison with Samantha Ronson was followed closely by the press

Subsequent years saw Lohan drift into smaller TV roles, including fronting a BBC documentary about child trafficking, while the tabloid headlines kept rolling in.

She had a much-publicised relationship with DJ Samantha Ronson, but refused to answer questions about her sexuality.

The couple's subsequent break-up saw Lohan take the unusual step of putting out a spoof video dating advert, introducing herself as ""a workaholic, a shopaholic and, according to the state of California, an alcoholic"".

Lohan also joked about her ongoing probation and the ever-growing number of Google searches about her private life.

In recent months, the actress has gained further notoriety for brushes with the legal system and her apparently wayward lifestyle.

She missed a routine court appearance, unable to return from the Cannes Film Festival after losing her passport. An initial warrant for her arrest was later revoked.

Lohan was later ordered to wear an alcohol monitoring bracelet as part of her probation deal, which activated during an MTV Movie Awards party.

The final path to jail was laid when she failed to attend alcohol education classes, although she insisted she had done ""everything I was told to do"".

After a stint in jail and court-ordered rehabilitation, the future looks uncertain for Lohan.

Her recent foray into fashion was not a resounding success, while a question hangs over her movie career.

Lohan had been lined up to play 1970s porn legend Linda Lovelace, a world away from the squeaky clean roles which originally propelled her into the spotlight.

Funeral of Clarissa Dickson Wright takes place in Edinburgh,The funeral of celebrated television cook Clarissa Dickson Wright takes place in Edinburgh.,,None,"Image copyright PA Image caption A red chilli and artichoke wreath reflected Dickson Wright's flamboyant nature

The funeral of celebrated television cook Clarissa Dickson Wright has taken place in Edinburgh.

The 66-year-old, who found fame as one of the Two Fat Ladies, died in the city on 15 March.

Friends and relatives attended a service at the city's St Mary's Metropolitan Cathedral, followed by a private cremation.

As a food writer and broadcaster, Dickson Wright was known for her frank manner and strong opinions.

'Mass of contradictions'

Her love of food was highlighted at the funeral with an unusual wreath including red chillies and artichokes on top of her coffin.

Born in London, she trained as a barrister and was the youngest woman ever to be called to the Bar at the time.

Alcohol addiction put an end to her legal career but in the mid 1990s she was spotted by a TV producer while working in an Edinburgh cookery shop.

Image caption Clarissa Dickson Wright fronted Two Fat Ladies and several solo TV shows

Teamed with the late Jennifer Paterson, the duo travelled around in a motorbike and sidecar, creating feasts as well as a hit BBC 2 series.

Delivering a eulogy, the Very Rev Monsignor Michael Regan said: ""Through her education and upbringing she proved herself to be a brilliant woman and her career seemed destined for greatness but she had the self-destruct mechanism of so many gifted people and her downward spiral is well known.

""But from that downward spiral where she found herself homeless and penniless she learned a sympathy with others that stayed with her and through her association with Alcoholics Anonymous she found and gave strength to others.""

She was a ""mass of contradictions"", he added.

A piper played outside the city centre church as her coffin was carried at the front of grieving family and friends.

Dickson Wright also appeared in other shows, including Clarissa and the Countryman and Clarissa and the King's Cookbook, and served as rector of Aberdeen University.

Food addiction: could overeating be compulsive?,Alcoholism researcher Sally Marlow examines whether food addiction could be fuelling a rise in obesity,,None,"Image copyright Science Photo Library

Scientists are divided over whether or not addiction could be contributing to rising global obesity. Does food addiction really exist and - if it does - how can it be treated?

Getting a grip on addiction can be incredibly hard, as anyone who has ever tried to give up smoking, alcohol or even caffeine will testify.

A tried and tested tactic is to avoid the thing you're addicted to - giving up going to pubs for a while, or not to have cigarettes in the house.

Even with these measures people often struggle and fail repeatedly.

But what if the thing you are addicted to has to be kept in the house, and worse, has to be something you sit down in front of three times a day?

As obesity levels continue to rise, the scientific community is starting to look for similarities between overeating and addiction.

The EU has funded a project called NeuroFAST to bring all the evidence together.

About the author Sally Marlow is an alcohol addiction researcher at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London. She has reported on alcohol for Radio 4's Today programme and for Inside Health

Researchers are cautious. So far there is only one type of eating disorder where it is thought addiction plays a role: Binge Eating Disorder, a side effect of which is often obesity.

Although we tend to trivialise the idea of addiction and food being related - many of us have at some point referred to ourselves as addicted to chocolate - Binge Eating Disorder is something which holds people within its grip.

It causes physical and psychological harm and is utterly miserable. Just like other forms of addiction.

One of the people I spoke to as part of my research, Michael, is an articulate, educated professional and a former overeater.

He said: ""It's difficult for others to understand. Everyone overeats and they think it's just a bigger version of that.

""It's a completely different experience - a constant, daily minute-to-minute obsession about getting the substance, food.

""It is hell being there in that place.""

Louise, another of those I met, provides a compelling testimony for addiction being at work in overeating.

She also had a serious alcohol problem and understands addiction more than most.

""I think what's most interesting is the similarities in behaviour,"" she says.

What is Binge Eating Disorder? A feeling of compulsion to overeat on a regular basis, sometimes including pre-planned binges

Those affected consume large amounts of food in a short time, often when they are not hungry

Overeating usually happens in private, leaving the person feeling out of control or guilty

The disorder is linked to obesity and conditions like high blood pressure and heart disease

Treatments include anti-depressants and cognitive therapies Source: NHS

""As an alcoholic I would go to different off-licences to buy my alcohol so people wouldn't recognise me, but I'd also go to different newsagents to buy chocolate so they wouldn't recognise me.

""Sneaking it into the house, not wanting people to see, hiding food, like an alcoholic hiding bottles, hiding empties.""

Dr Nora Volkow, a prominent neuroscientist and head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse in the United States, is clear in her mind that there are biological processes underpinning what Michael and Louise describe.

She has found that a neurotransmitter called dopamine, which is known to be involved in addiction, behaves in the brain in the same way in those who are heavily addicted to drugs and those who are obese.

For her this is strong evidence that food, or eating, can be addictive.

Not everybody agrees. Professor Jane Ogden, a psychologist at the University of Surrey, believes the label of addiction can be unhelpful for those who overeat - it removes personal responsibility and hinders recovery.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The number of obese people in the UK has more than trebled in 25 years

""The addiction world has given us a strong narrative that says you have no control - things in your brain are wanting more sugar or chocolate"" she says.

But if food is like other addictions, we should theoretically see overlaps in successful treatments.

Addiction treatment has a goal of either complete abstinence or reducing harm - for example by prescribing methadone or nicotine gum.

For those working towards abstinence, one tried and tested model is the 12-step programme developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, with versions for drugs used by Narcotics Anonymous and gambling by Gamblers Anonymous.

Twenty years ago people were reluctant to accept that gambling could be addictive, but now there is widespread acceptance of this idea

Michael and Louise are both members of Overeaters Anonymous. It works in much the same way as the other 12-step programmes with peer-led group confidential meetings, personal mentors, and a structured programme of steps to work through.

There is no doubt that for some it's highly successful, just like Alcoholics Anonymous can be.

It's not possible to abstain from eating, of course, but it is possible to abstain from overeating.

For Louise, abstinence is three healthy meals a day, no wheat and no chocolate. For Michael his abstinence food plan is determined by his sponsor - he is told by someone else what he is allowed to eat.

Other treatments are more radical.

In alcohol addiction, the body can be altered so that it rejects alcohol by implanting a drug known as antabuse.

If alcohol is consumed, the body reacts with nausea.

Similarly in overeating, the body can be altered by bariatric surgery - a gastric band, bypass or sleeve, which restricts the volume of the stomach available for food.

It sounds extreme but it works for most people, and the evidence shows the risks of surgery are far outweighed by the health benefits of losing excess weight.

People live longer, and have fewer heart and mobility problems. Diabetes is even reversed in some cases, and people report a massively improved quality of life.

The possible relationships between food and addiction are incredibly complicated, and there is a lot we do not yet understand.

Twenty years ago people were reluctant to accept that gambling could be addictive, but now there is widespread acceptance of this idea, and good evidence to support it.

Are we at the same place with food - waiting for the evidence and attitudes to change?

Nicola Schlesinger, a counsellor, works with women who have addiction problems and eating disorders. What would she say to those scientists who do not believe food can be addictive?

""They don't necessarily have the people sitting in front of them that I have on a daily basis in tears, in pain, hating themselves, feeling suicidal,"" she says.

""They can say what they like but in the end we still have to deal with the reality of the situation as it presents itself.""

Hopefully NeuroFAST and others will move us closer to narrowing the gap between scientists on both sides of the debate, and find solutions for people who do feel a compulsion to overeat.

I begged social services to take my children away,Sam spent more than 20 years as an addict before overcoming a cycle of trauma and abusive relationships.,,None,"Sam spent more than 20 years as an addict, battling to get clean and sober. But she didn't want the methadone she was repeatedly prescribed by her local drugs service - she wanted to be abstinent. She tells Milly Chowles how she overcame a cycle of trauma and abusive relationships to beat her addictions by herself.

My husband didn't tell me it was heroin when he gave it to me to smoke. He told me it was cannabis resin. And then after about a week I really started to feel unwell.

There was a programme on the telly about a boy who had a habit and was withdrawing and I linked it to what I was experiencing. I woke my husband up in the middle of the night and absolutely went ballistic.

We had two children by then. I can remember saying: ""I don't want to do this no more, I don't want to go further,"" and begging him not to go and score. And he just didn't listen to me.

I remember just sitting in that front room watching him smoking, and feeling defeated.

The crack came in about a week later. I can remember watching him smoking it and he was going: ""Just try one, just try one,"" and I was like: ""No, no, I will never ever smoke that stuff,"" and I'd believe it when I was saying that.

But in the end I gave in, and I didn't stop for the best part of the next two decades.

It is a phenomenal force. It just takes over you.

I'd started shoplifting and offending, minor offences. I got arrested quite quickly and I went to prison.

My first sentence was only eight weeks, of which I served four. While I was there the children went into care for a little while. I managed to get them back when I came out, but two months later I'd been sectioned.

So I rang up social services from the psychiatric hospital and said: ""You need to go round to my house and take my children."" They'd been left with my husband who was using drugs - I knew they weren't safe. And they came, they took them, and they were adopted within a year. They never returned to my care again.

The adoption papers were signed while I was in prison. I'd gone from psychiatric hospital back on to the streets, back into prison. And that's how my life was for 15 years - in and out of psychiatric hospitals and in and out of prisons.

I can remember my last visit with my children and the obsession to use drugs was so strong that even as I took them down to the car, I was texting my dealer.

People say: ""Oh you'll find acceptance around it."" I accept that I was ill. And I can honestly say that would not have happened if I didn't have the substance in me. But it's something that I still haven't forgiven myself for. I don't know if I ever will.

I take full responsibility for my using and I don't blame my husband. I have an illness.

But addiction all comes down to relationships and being hurt again and again, and being left with no trust. I was always in a relationship and every relationship was dysfunctional. Every single one.

The really sad part of it is that I really thought these men loved me. When I began doing sex work they would sit and wait for me to get home and then they'd go to score with the money I'd just earned. Looking back now I really kick myself that I allowed that to happen - that I'd go out and let that stuff happen to me, and then give over my money and share what I'd just earned with somebody who didn't value me whatsoever.

How could they watch me go out there night after night, somebody who they're supposed to love and care about? I don't know how they could touch me after I'd gone and done that stuff.

One night I had a really bad experience. A punter raped me in his car. I just got out of that car. I didn't go home, I didn't tell my husband. I went back out and I found another punter. I don't remember much of the night but I remember those two punters.

I went straight back out again because of the obsession to use more drugs. I needed the money. It's that powerful. That's the control drugs had over me.

In the end I met somebody else while my husband was in prison, serving a long sentence. I went from this co-dependent using relationship to a very violent abusive relationship. The progression with each relationship, it just got worse. And again I stayed.

Once he headbutted me, to the point that I passed out. When I came round the first thing I said was, ""Oh, give me a cuddle please."" And I'm the one saying sorry for something I haven't done. Absolutely nuts.

I stayed in that relationship for about eight years.

It wasn't the heroin or crack that brought me to my knees in the end, it was the alcohol.

The two children from my second relationship had gone off to live with family. I was isolated in a flat on my own and my life for 18 months was waking up, and getting as much Tennent's Super in me as I could. Some days I was too frightened to go out the door and get my methadone script - I would rather sit there and withdraw as long as I had the Tennent's.

I couldn't even open the curtains in the end. Couldn't take sunlight on my face. I did not want to be in any type of reality at all.

I despised myself, absolutely despised myself.

My friend Pat died six days before I was due to go into rehab. I can remember just smashing my flat up. I must have been screaming so loudly that my neighbours rang the police and the police kicked my door in.

I was on my front-room floor, screaming that I didn't want to die. I'd never had a policeman hug me, but one of them hugged me. I must have looked such a mess.

I think it was in that moment I knew I'd had enough, I'd really had enough of it.

I'd been fighting to get into recovery for a long time. There were three different treatment centres and numerous detoxes along the way. But in May 2014 I went off to a treatment centre in Weston-super-Mare. I was so angry when I got there that they put me on a behavioural contract almost immediately. They said if I didn't conform to it and stop arguing with everyone, that I would be discharged. I looked at this contract one night and thought: ""I'm not going to be able to do this."" And I knew if I got discharged I'd use. So I decided to take control and made a decision to leave of my own accord.

I was still heavily scripted on methadone and valium, I hadn't finished my alcohol detox. And I told them I was going. And they said: ""Where are you going?"" And I said I was going to a Narcotics Anonymous meeting in London. And they looked at me like I was an absolute lunatic. And I probably was, a bit.

It was a big leap of faith. I was homeless because I couldn't go back to my flat because of bail conditions. I went to a meeting in Soho in London. And I sat in that meeting and I asked for help and that's what I got.

Three people in that meeting aren't with us any more, they're dead. I really do grasp how lucky I am.

After nearly 20 years of addiction and in drugs and alcohol services, the services didn't help me stop using. In fact, if anything I feel they kept me using longer with methadone prescriptions. They never once mentioned mutual aid groups. Their answer every time was more medication, never abstinence.

I stopped my script dead and I got clean in the meetings. And I am proud of that.

This month I will have been clean for three-and-a-half years.

Help with addiction

It's not been easy. I got made homeless six months ago which was really frightening, really scary. It was an on-the-spot eviction, I was asked to leave straight away. I didn't know where I was going. I didn't know what I was doing. But I got through it and I stayed clean.

I have complex PTSD, which I put down to to the sex working I did during my addiction. It affects every area of my life because I am so easily triggered. But I'm determined to recover from it. I didn't come into recovery to be like this. But it's manageable. I manage it, to get by.

I'm rebuilding a relationship with my oldest two children, and this Christmas was the first time I've had my daughter with me since 2012.

I now run women's recovery groups in a day centre and I'm doing well at college - I left school when I was 13.

No, I don't have a flat. No, I'm not in full-time employment. I'm living in a hostel, which is challenging at times, very challenging. But every time I look out my window and it's raining, gratitude just comes over me that I haven't got to go out in that rain and wait for a punter to come and pick me up.

It's not perfect at the minute, it's not great. But… it's all right. Life's all right.

Dorset woman's bulimia made her suicidal,"With National Eating Disorders Awareness Week well under way, a Weymouth woman reveals how she freed herself from the vicious cycle of bulimia and overeating.",,None,"Image caption Bulimia is about five times more common than anorexia nervosa, research shows.

Three years ago Anne-Marie wanted to die.

For 11 years the Weymouth office worker, whose name has been changed to protect her anonymity, had been trapped in a vicious cycle of surreptitious binge-eating and vomiting.

By 2008 her eating disorder had taken over her life to the extent that once her bills were paid any remaining money was spent on food.

""My life revolved around food,"" the 27-year-old told BBC News. ""On a typical morning I would go to the supermarket to fill two shopping bags with bread, chocolate, cakes and biscuits.

""Then I'd go home, eat it and stick my two fingers down my throat to make myself sick.""

Anne-Marie is among some 1.6 million people in the UK with an eating disorder, according to Beat, a charity which supports adults and young people affected by this form of mental illness.

It has been running a host of events across the country to mark Eating Disorder Awareness Week.

A spokeswoman for the charity said: ""We believe more people are becoming aware that it is a serious psychological condition.

""There are so many preconceptions but you can beat an eating disorder.""

In my head, I was fat and ugly but in reality I was a normal-looking child Anne-Marie

Sufferers exhibit an abnormal attitude towards food which causes them to drastically alter their eating habits and behaviour.

Another type of eating disorder is anorexia nervosa, where a person starves themselves and exercises excessively to maintain a life-threateningly low weight.

Bulimia is about five times more common than anorexia nervosa, with 90% of people with the condition female, according to the NHS Choices website.

For Anne-Marie's behaviour to go undetected at work, she had to employ cunning tactics - locking herself in her office at lunchtime to binge-eat and then vomiting in the nearby ladies' toilet.

She said she always feared a passing colleague would hear her.

""I was frightened people would see what I was eating and the amounts,"" Anne-Marie explained.

""I did all my eating in secret and then ate normally in front of people.""

Anne-Marie blames an inability to express her emotions as a child and being unhappy with her appearance for her self-destructive behaviour.

""I did not like the way I looked,"" she added. ""In my head, I was fat and ugly but in reality I was a normal-looking child.

""I tried to control these feelings through food.""

'First bite'

She said she had fallen ""into the depths of despair"" when fate intervened in the form of her future husband Jonathan whom she met through mutual friends at a party.

""He had been attending Alcoholics Anonymous for seven years and suggested I attend an Overeaters Anonymous (OA) meeting.

""I was sceptical about it, at first, but then I found I liked the people there.""

Anne-Marie credits the meetings - which she has been attending up to three times a week for the past three years - with bringing about an end to her binge-eating and purging cycle.

""I have learned to express myself and am now aware that if I am compelled to overeat there are unresolved emotions,"" she continued.

""We also encourage each other at the meetings to call someone before we take the first bite.""

Other OA tools Anne-Marie now uses as a part of her coping mechanism include writing her thoughts down and offering support to fellow attendees.

She added: ""My life is really good now, I am happily married, I changed my job and I express my feelings more.

""The fact that I have not binged or vomited to get through my day a miracle and a relief.""","['disorder', 'womans', 'nervosa', 'life', 'eating', 'annemarie', 'ugly', 'dorset', 'reality', 'bulimia', 'suicidal', 'times', 'express', 'anorexia']","Image caption Bulimia is about five times more common than anorexia nervosa, research shows.

Sex addiction divides expert opinion, but for some people it is a very real condition that can be shameful and even ""life-destroying"". As relationship charity Relate calls for help to be made available on the NHS, two sufferers speak about the impact it has had on their lives.

""At its worst, even having sex five times a day wasn't enough.""

Mother-of-three Rebecca Barker said the compulsion took over her life in 2014 and ruined her relationship.

Her addiction meant she was constantly asking her partner for sex.

""It was literally the first thing I thought about when I woke up, I just couldn't get it off my mind,"" said the 37-year-old, originally from Tadcaster in North Yorkshire.

""I felt like everything reminded me of it. I think it was linked to my depression and the lack of serotonin. I felt like my whole body was craving it.

""It was giving me the instant hit and five minutes later I wanted it again.

""I became a hermit, I stayed at home because I felt ashamed that it was all I could think about. Even though no-one could read my mind, it still felt very uncomfortable for me to be around other people.""

Ms Barker's addiction caused serious problems in her relationship. Though her partner enjoyed the attention at first, it became insurmountable for the couple.

""At first he was fine with it but towards the end he couldn't understand it at all. After a few months he started to raise questions about why and where it was coming from.

""He accused me of having an affair - he thought I must have been feeling guilty about it and that's why I wanted sex with him.""

In November 2014, Ms Barker ""needed a break"" from the relationship and went to stay with her mother.

""When I left, I told my partner I needed to get better. He let me go, then the relationship broke down very quickly after that.

""I was under the care of a psychiatrist at the time - she kept saying she would alter my medication but she never said there were any support groups or anything.""

Ms Barker was diagnosed with depression in 2012 after the birth of her third child. She said after it intensified in 2014 she changed jobs, split up with her partner and moved to France.

""I made many lifestyle changes in order to get over the depression and the addiction and for me that has worked,"" she said.

What is sex addiction?

Relate defines sexual addiction as any sexual activity that feels ""out of control"".

The Association for the Treatment of Sex Addiction and Compulsivity says its number of sex therapists has doubled in the past five years to 170

A questionnaire completed by 21,058 people since 2013 on the Sex Addiction Help website revealed 91% of those seeking help for sex addiction were male

The largest age group of 31% was aged 26-35, 1% were under 16 and 8% over 55

The World Health Organization is expected to approve the inclusion of ""compulsive sexual behaviour disorder"" in its International Classification of Diseases (ICD) list in May 2019

The NHS says experts disagree about whether it is possible to become addicted to sex and points to Relate for further help

Graham, whose name has been changed to protect his identity, said his compulsion led him to cheat on his wife with ""hundreds"" of sex workers, leaving him with ""rip-roaring guilt"".

""When you are in full-blown addiction you are obsessed with thinking about it - from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep.

""It was a horrible, gross experience - there is nothing sexy about it. When you wake up in the morning with a dose of chlamydia, it is not sexy.

""It is damaging and life-destroying.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Graham said when his wife found out he was relieved

Graham, who is in his 60s, estimates he paid hundreds of pounds a month for sex over several years, even building relationships with some of the sex workers he saw.

""What started with one affair at work led to another - but unlike most office affairs which may stem from one partner being unhappily married, mine was an addiction which I had to feed each day.

""You have one affair and then you want another and another one.

""I soon realised that the quickest and most convenient way for me to feed my addiction was to pay for it. I would be seeing escorts, sex workers, three or four times per week.

""It is just like being an alcoholic, it's a cycle that builds up in your mind - you feel a high from thinking about how it might happen and then you act it out in the way you planned.

""Then when it's over you feel remorseful, you say you're never going to do it again.""

Graham stopped leading his ""horrendous double life"" when his wife found an email and confronted him.

He sought help from Sex Addicts Anonymous (SAA), which has 78 self-help groups around the UK, and said he has abstained from extra-marital sex for several years.

""When I was found out, I remember feeling 'thank God - something might change'.

""I went to SAA which is an abstinence-based treatment. I call it going from shame to grace.

""It is such a relief to go to the meetings and find out there are other people who are just as miserable and sordid as you are.

""For people who are in this situation, I just want them to know that there is a way out and you can break the cycle.""

Peter Saddington, from Relate, said there is some therapy and group work available for sex addicts, but most of it is private.

""[Addicts] realise it is causing harm, but they can't stop and they recognise they need help in changing it.

""For alcoholics, there is Alcoholics Anonymous, but they can also go to the NHS [which] provides support for people who have alcohol or drug problems.

""It would be appropriate that [sex addicts] can go to their GP and get support because it has a crippling effect both on them, on relationships, on their families, their financial situation and their mental health.""

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""People who think they may have a sex addiction can seek advice and help via NHS Choices, which includes contacts at Relate, Sexaholics Anonymous, SAA and ATSAC.""

Twitter thrives for two main reasons. First, it’s cunningly engineered: The visible Tweet contains up to 140 characters, but each message also has 31 hidden data fields which allow Twitter to analyse and monetise network activity. Second, it has uncovered value in “a latent aspect of human life”, something that humans produce freely and plentifully, but which was previously seen as worthless: trivial chatter.

Researchers claim to have discovered a fundamental flaw in Bitcoin which could enable dishonest miners to hijack the currency. “The Bitcoin protocol is not incentive-compatible. The protocol can be gamed by people with selfish interests. And once the system veers away from the happy mode where everyone is honest, there is no force that opposes the growth of really large pools that command control of the currency.”

In praise of the polymath

Robert Twigger | Aeon | 4 November 2013

We overvalue specialists in the intellectual world, and undervalue generalists — perhaps because the division of labour has worked well in the business world. But skilled polymaths are happier and more innovative. “Over-specialisation eventually retreats into defending what one has learnt rather than making new connections. The initial spurt of learning gives out, and the expert is left, like an animal, merely defending his territory.”

Mark Jackson | The Conversation | 4 November 2013

A physicist explains. “Theoretical physicists construct theories of nature. For a theory to be true it must be both consistent with itself and consistent with nature.

Popular lore can be sometimes dramatically overturned, like the interdiction against sailing too far away, lest you fall off the edge of the world.”

Why Russia’s drinkers resist AA

Russia has a colossal drinking problem. Alcoholics Anonymous has shown the power of mutual support groups to combat alcoholism. Yet AA has made almost no headway in Russia: there are four times as many AA groups in Boston as in the whole of Russia. Why? Because Russians don’t think drinking is wrong, and they have low levels of trust. “The idea that another drunk can help you is asinine to most Russians.”

Russell Brand takes on Arthur remake,"The BBC's Tom Brook speaks to Russell Brand about taking on the Arthur role made famous by Dudley Moore, along with his co-star Dame Helen Mirren.",,None,"Image caption Russell Brand plays a rich heir with a penchant for drink in Arthur

Comedian turned actor Russell Brand can currently be seen as Arthur, the drunken New York playboy made famous by Dudley Moore in his 1981 romantic comedy.

In recent days Brand has been selling the contemporary remake to US journalists, putting the emphasis on its topicality.

""I think Arthur should be regarded as a fairy-tale prince - a person bestowed with wealth at birth,"" he says.

""In this year of the Royal Wedding, how wonderful to see a romantic comedy focused on a prince.""

Dame Helen Mirren appears opposite Brand, stepping into the late Sir John Gielgud's shoes to play the heir's faithful servant.

Yet where Gielgud was Arthur's butler in the original film, Dame Helen plays his nanny.

Image caption Dame Helen Mirren (r) co-stars as Arthur's nanny in the film

The Oscar-winning actress shares several scenes with the larger-than-life Brand, whom she says was ""utterly disciplined"" on the set.

He may have been well-behaved, but according to Dame Helen there was also room for spontaneity.

""Russell often would improvise. I would more go the route of saying, 'I could say this' and pass it by the writer.""

Dame Helen, 65, sees Arthur as breaking new ground for her in career terms.

""I did it because I'd never done a big, full-out comedy before. I've done films that are comedic, but I've never done a film that is a comedy.""

The actress says she often finds herself ""frightened and intimidated"" on movie sets, as was the case with Arthur.

Surprisingly perhaps, she finds that she is often in awe of the big names with whom she works.

""I get totally starstruck. I can't talk to them and I don't feel good enough,"" she says.

Drunkenness

Brand, 35, says bringing Arthur up to date involved some adjustments, including addressing ""the changing attitude to alcoholism"".

In the original picture, Arthur's constant drunkenness was presented as a harmless indulgence. Now, though, it would be viewed as full-blown alcoholism.

Indeed, the new film depicts Arthur attending an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

Brand, who has admitted his own problems with addiction in the past, thinks his own experiences may have helped him with his portrayal.

One would hope that from this point I will be able to build a legacy of which I could be proud Russell Brand

In a move that will alarm some recovering alcoholics, the star reveals that whiskey was on hand while the film was being shot.

""I would carry a bottle of booze about on the set and before takes have a big nostril-full of whiskey to get myself prepared, to evoke the memories of my drunken days,"" says the dandyish joker.

However, Brand insists he was aware of the risks involved. ""Some people said it was dangerous and were concerned about it,"" he reveals.

""But if ever anyone saw me begin to raise it to my lips in an attempt to once more release the demons from within, then people would clutch it pretty quickly.""

US actress Greta Gerwig, best known for her work in independent cinema, plays Arthur's love interest in the film.

In the 1981 version that role belonged to Liza Minnelli, who has been reticent when it comes to the new production.

""It has nothing to do with me,"" the Cabaret star told reporters recently. ""I just think of Dudley so it's difficult for me, thinking of him.""

Mixed reviews

The Arthur remake is raising Brand's profile in the US, but ultimately he wants to make an impact away from the world of entertainment.

""One would hope that from this point I will be able to build a legacy of which I could be proud - that reaches beyond entertainment and into philanthropy and altruism.""

Image caption The film has received mixed reviews from US critics

When asked what altruistic deeds he has in mind he says: ""I think I'll have to await opportunities because I'm not a grand social architect.

""I am but a comedian, but I would just like to think that I'm prepared spiritually to be open.""

Arthur performed modesty at the US box office in its opening weekend and has received some damning reviews.

The New York Times referred to the film as a ""grim load of mediocrity"", while other reviewers have described it as bland and muddle-headed.

Many commentators take the view that the original was such a beloved classic that any remake was bound to fall short.

Yet it has some supporters. The San Francisco Chronicle, for example, found Brand ""a worthy successor to Dudley Moore who has a darkness inside him that feels right for the time and for the character"".

Arthur is out in the UK on 22 April.","['takes', 'helen', 'think', 'arthur', 'plays', 'remake', 'russell', 'film', 'brand', 'original', 'arthurs']","Image caption Russell Brand plays a rich heir with a penchant for drink in ArthurComedian turned actor Russell Brand can currently be seen as Arthur, the drunken New York playboy made famous by Dudley Moore in his 1981 romantic comedy.

'Take my brain out': The artists awakened by brain injuries,"Thirty artists are exhibiting their work, many for the first time. The collective has only one thing in common - they all survived severe brain injuries.",,None,"Image copyright Phil

Thirty extraordinary artists who survived brain injuries, but found a new craft, are exhibiting their work in London this month, many for the first time.

For five days a week the art studio at Headway East London, set within a railway arch in Hackney, comes to life with people acquiring new skills and producing artwork.

Many had shown little or no interest in art until they were injured and invited into the studio.

Each member of Headway East London acquired their injuries as an adult. Some as a result of violent assaults, car crashes or meningitis, while others are from less common causes including hypoxia - a suffocation injury.

Ben Graham from the Headway charity says: ""Quite a few of the people we're tending to see can't do their former jobs, or their relationships have broken down or maybe they're the parent but need caring for themselves.

Sandra Lott worked in banking in the City of London and would often travel to Europe and America on business. She suffered head trauma in 2013. The resulting injury means she walks with a stick, has cognitive fatigue and aphasia - a communication disorder.

""When I was at work, I fell over and security got me to the hospital. I was there for three days and then I was okay, but then I fell over on the stairs. Me and my friend we just had a coffee. I was walking around Liverpool Street and there were loads of steps, and that's when I fell on them.

""I was sick for a year. But then, when I came to Headway I just loved it.""

Sandra enjoyed art as a child, but gave up as a teenager. One of the pieces she is exhibiting, Witches and Buildings, was inspired by 9/11. She had been working in New York shortly before.

Image copyright Sandra Lott

""I had crabs and lizards and there was a man who was going into a helicopter - they were helping them after the World Trade Centre. That was because three weeks before, I went to the city. All the people who died, it was awful.""

Sandra says her family has been very supportive of her art.

""My husband's going to come to the exhibition. He loves it. My husband is a photographer. I used to help him. I think in 2017 I would like to help his photography - I really want to do it.""

Headway East London started in 1997 with one therapist and a single client. It's since grown and offers a variety of services. Rather than short-term rehabilitation with a discharge date it hopes to offer support as long as is needed; helping to redefine the person and giving them a positive outlook and productive use of their time.

Many of the 40 members who use the studio now consider art their job.

Graham says ""Therapy is about making yourself better, but what they're doing is about making something, selling it to people, engaging with the public and forming an identity they feel comfortable and happy with.

Image copyright Headway East London

""Essentially they're no longer unemployed, which affects their self-worth, and gives people that root to self-expression.""

Headway is based in a unit complete with a kitchen, gym and therapy rooms with the Submit To Love Studio next door providing a bespoke space for painting, sculpting and ceramics.

When it first opened Graham says it led to an ""explosion"" of artwork and an ""astonishing uptake"" which they hope to continue nurturing.

Nick Mayers, 56, had spent 16 years in the Parachute Regiment before he had two strokes in one year. The second resulted in a haemorrhage which has affected his speech, memory and mobility. Nick will often paint images he sees in books.

Image copyright Nick Mayers

""I was born, Nicholas Mayers. I was born 4th January, Battersea Park. When I was four-years-old I first started to paint.""

Nick's strokes meant he has had to teach himself how to draw using his left hand, despite having grown up right-handed.""

For anyone thinking of taking up art Nick has some advice: ""Make it up as you go along. When I finish painting I never look back. Don't get attached.""

Some of the artists have exhibited before but for many it will be the first time the public has a chance to see and buy the pieces with any profits split 50/50 between the artist and charity.

Graham says Headway East London is ""not in a hurry to make it a commercial enterprise"" but already prices have increased. Drawings used to go for about £20, but one artist has sold a piece for £1,600 and has a further eight chosen for £2,400.

""I don't think financial gain is the priority. Feeling valuable and engaged and pursuing something meaningful to them is the most important thing, and in a setting where they're connecting with others,"" Graham says.

""They're doing art for its own sake. It's a really exciting time for us and we all share that sense of pride together as a community.""

Phil, a 44 year old father-of-two, was a pedestrian in a road traffic accident in 2015. He has problems with physical and cognitive fatigue, memory and concentration.

Image copyright Phil

""I used to draw for my kids. I suppose I did have an eye but it didn't connect to how I would normally do things.

""I was really confused that I couldn't draw a line. Before the accident I would have been fine.""

He said he struggled at first spending whole days working on it before declaring ""I've failed"" but after taking a more relaxed approach art has become his release.

""The piece I'm doing now - it's massive. It's a painting collage. It's a bit to do with me - the dark to the light. I think it's like my journey of this accident.""

He says before he started at Headway he wasn't sure what to expect.

""People think it's like AA [Alcoholics Anonymous] - where you sit around in a circle and give out your feelings. This is totally different. This is my space from 10 'til 3, I take my brain out and recharge it.

""It's a wonderful place to recharge my brain and I'm allowed to be myself.""

Jay-Z and Meek Mill pledge $50m to free prisoners,"The rappers aim to free one million people who they say are ""trapped in the system"".",,None,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jay-Z and Meek Mill have partnered with the owners of the New England Patriots and Philadelphia 76ers, among others, to launch the Reform Alliance

Jay-Z, Meek Mill and sport and business leaders have pledged $50m (£38m) to reform the US criminal justice system.

The Reform Alliance, which was inspired by Meek Mill's recent stint in prison for a minor probation violation, hopes to free one million prisoners in five years.

The owners of the New England Patriots and Philadelphia 76ers, Robert Kraft and Michael Rubin, are co-founders.

Reform says it wants to help people who are ""trapped in the system"".

The group's ""mission"" is to ""dramatically reduce the number of people who are unjustly under the control of the criminal justice system, starting with probation and parole"".

""To win, we will leverage our considerable resources to change laws, policies, hearts and minds,"" it says.

More than six million people can currently count themselves as part of the ""correctional population"" of the USA - which includes people in prisons and local jails, but is mostly made up of the more than four million people on probation or parole, according to Bureau of Justice statistics.

Probation is often given as a sentence instead of time in prison and can include conditions like being on a curfew or going to rehab.

Parole is when an inmate is released early from prison with similar conditions to probation.

Meek Mill has experienced all three: probation, parole and jail.

The Reform Alliance says his case is an example of the ""devastating and long-lasting effects"" that can occur after one interaction with the criminal justice system.

The rapper was arrested in 2007 - he says wrongfully - for drug and gun charges, aged 19.

He was sentenced in 2009 to between 11 and 23 months in county prison, but was released on parole after five months and put on house arrest.

It was during this time he started to make his name nationally as a rapper, signing to Rick Ross's label and releasing a string of hugely successful mixtapes.

Before long he was a platinum-selling artist.

But a parole violation for suspected cannabis use resulted in a ban on touring, and then after failing to get his travel plans approved by the court Meek was sentenced to prison again in 2014.

Examples of parole violations that can land people back in prison range from being late to appointments with parole officers or missing a curfew, to things more specific to the crime that was committed - like failing to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

""When you talk about these so-called technical violations, it's not technical to the kid who can never see her mum again because she showed up late for a meeting. That's not technical, that's devastating for that individual child,"" Reform Alliance CEO Van Jones said.

Violations over the next few years resulted in his probation period being extended - it now lasts up until 2023 - as well as the five months in prison which ended in April 2018 and birthed the #FreeMeek movement.

It's people with a similar story to Meek's, that have been ""caught up on probation and parole"", that Reform says it wants to focus on first.

'If someone commits a crime they should go to jail'

""Being from the environment I'm from, I don't even think it's possible for you to be an angel,"" Meek said as the organisation was announced in New York.

""You grow up around murder on a daily basis, you grow up in drug-infested neighbourhoods.

""And every time I started to further my life with the music industry, there was always something that brought me back to ground zero,"" he said.

Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, who attended the event, said he was a supporter of criminal justice reforms that are ""fair, help our system work better and smarter, and save crucial taxpayer dollars while balancing public safety and victim concerns"".

Across the US, roughly a third of people on parole are black, according to Bureau of Justice statistics - something Jay-Z raised at the event.

""We want to be very clear. If someone commits a crime they should go to jail. But these things are just disproportionate and the whole world knows it,"" he said.

Jay-Z has been vocal about Meek's case, writing in the New York Times while he was imprisoned.

""On the surface, this may look like the story of yet another criminal rapper who didn't smarten up and is back where he started,"" he wrote.

""What's happening to Meek Mill is just one example of how our criminal justice system entraps and harasses hundreds of thousands of black people every day.

""I saw this up close when I was growing up in Brooklyn during the 1970s and 1980s. Instead of a second chance, probation ends up being a land mine, with a random misstep bringing consequences greater than the crime. A person on probation can end up in jail over a technical violation like missing a curfew.""

India outrage over Goa minister's plan to 'cure' gays,"There is outrage in India after a minister in Goa says the state government is planning to set up centres to ""cure"" homosexuals and make them ""normal"".",,None,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Many people in India still regard same-sex relationships as illegitimate

There has been outrage in India after a minister in Goa said the state government was planning to set up centres to ""cure"" homosexuals.

Sports and Youth Affairs Minister Ramesh Tawadkar said treatment would be offered to lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders to make them ""normal"".

Many have taken to social networking sites to criticise Mr Tawadkar's ""shocking statement"".

India's treatment of homosexuals has been under the spotlight recently.

The Indian Supreme Court's 2013 decision to reverse a lower court order striking down a 153-year-old British colonial-era law criminalising homosexual acts caused global outrage with many describing it as ""disgraceful"".

According to Section 377 of the law, a same-sex relationship is an ""unnatural offence"" and punishable by a 10-year jail term.

A BBC correspondent in Delhi says although the law has rarely - if ever - been used to prosecute anyone for consensual sex, it has often been used by the police to harass homosexuals.

Also, in deeply conservative India, homosexuality is a taboo and many people still regard same-sex relationships as illegitimate and our correspondent says Mr Tawadkar's comment is an endorsement of that conservative thought.

""We will make LGBT [lesbians, gay, bisexual and transgender] youth normal. We will have a centre for them... like Alcoholics Anonymous centres. We will train them and give them medicines too,"" Mr Tawadkar said on Monday while discussing the Bharatiya Janata Party-run state government's policy report on youth.

""As in the case of other target groups such as juvenile offenders, drug afflicted youth, marginalised or migrant youth, geographically disadvantaged youth, a detailed survey would be carried out of the LGBT community so that their problems could be specifically addressed,"" the minister added.

The minister's statement has led to outrage in India with many people condemning it on social media sites like Twitter.

Journalist Barkha Dutt said it was the ""insensitive"" minister who needed treatment:

Meanwhile, the head of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, who is visiting Delhi, said he ""staunchly opposed the criminalisation of homosexuality"" in India.

""I am proud to stand for the equality of all people - including those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender,"" the UN chief said in a statement late on Monday.

""I speak out because laws criminalising consensual, adult same-sex relationships violate basic rights to privacy and to freedom from discrimination.

"John McAfee: Addict, coder, runaway","John McAfee speaks to the BBC about his time on the run after his neighbour was found murdered, his addiction to drugs and why he thinks Silicon Valley needs a shake-up.",,None,"Who is the real John McAfee? He's the man who went on the run after his neighbour was found dead, face-up, with a bullet in his head. He's the man who jump-started the multibillion-dollar anti-virus industry. And now he thinks he can make you invisible on the internet.

Within tech circles he's long been a legend. But for most people, McAfee came to prominence last year when he fled his Central American home - teeth stained, hair dyed, in disguise - rather than let himself be questioned by authorities he accused of being corrupt.

He tells the BBC he had ""no connection whatsoever"" with his neighbour's death. Police say he remains a ""person of interest"".

Back in the US, after posting footage of young female ""friends"" stroking his naked tattooed torso, he now plans to neutralise the NSA's cyber-surveillance system.

It might suggest a crazed, perhaps even deranged, personality. One journalist who has interviewed McAfee many times described him a ""master manipulator"" who lies and deceives.

Image caption John McAfee returned to the US last December after being released from a Guatemalan jail

""I've been called paranoid, schizophrenic, the wild child of Silicon Valley,"" McAfee acknowledges.

But he has a different perspective: ""I'm an entrepreneur. I always have been. I am curious and I enjoy solving problems.

""I think that it's when we step out of the road, step outside the box, become our own person and we walk fearlessly down paths other people wouldn't look at, that true progress comes. And sometimes true beauty as well.

""We're missing that. We're missing the people who have the courage to walk into the wilderness just to see what's there.""

This is how Amy Emshwiller, the teenage ex-prostitute he lived with in Belize, describes him: ""He's sweet, generous. He likes to like adventures. He's serious and usually he has a dark sense of humour. He's generally a sweet guy. He just doesn't like to be [expletive] with.""

So, who is the real John McAfee?

To have any chance of knowing and gaining an informed opinion of what really motivated his erratic-sounding behaviour after the killing of Gregory Faull, you must travel deep into the 68-year-old's past.

Addicted and expelled

Despite his Southern accent, the bleached-blond and goateed businessman is in fact half-British - the son of an Englishwoman who met an American soldier stationed in the UK during World War II.

When she tried to shoot me in the head, what I saw was a frightened child. I'm deaf in one ear now, but I don't have a bullet in my head John McAfee

""I feel as much British as I do American,"" McAfee says. ""There's not much difference between our countries.""

They moved to Virginia when he was young, where he had a troubled childhood. His father was an abusive alcoholic who, when McAfee was aged 15, shot himself dead. In the following years, McAfee says, he too began drinking heavily and taking drugs, but still managed to maintain a promising academic career.

That came to an end in the late 1960s when Northeast State Louisiana State College terminated his PhD in mathematics after it was revealed that he had slept with an undergraduate he was mentoring.

They later married and McAfee turned his skills to a series of programming jobs with some of the biggest tech organisations of the time including Nasa, General Electric, Siemens, Univac and Xerox, all the while continuing to indulge in his addictions.

Image caption John McAfee played up to his bad boy reputation in a video he uploaded in June

""Most of my bosses also used drugs of some kind,"" he says. ""I was in the tech field, after all, we were the leading edge in technology and the leading age in personal experimentation.

""I had to hide it from my mother and sometimes from my wife. But in the work environment - depending on where you worked - in some companies drugs were taken openly at lunchtime in people's offices. It was a bizarre time.""

Image caption McAfee says he has never used anti-virus software

Matters came to a head in the early 1980s after his wife left him, his most recent employer, Omex, let him go and the scale of his drug dependency forced him to seek help.

""It was 1984, the last time that I took drugs, drank alcohol or sold drugs for that matter,"" he says.

""I simply stopped. I started going to an organisation called Alcoholics Anonymous... and that was my last taste of that world.

""However, it is still with me. My body is covered with tattoos from that period. And I'm afraid some of my ideas and concepts and attitudes that were moulded during that time are still with me. That's why people think, perhaps, I'm a little bit off the wall.""

Anti-virus millionaire

Despite his troubles, McAfee managed to land a job at defence contractor Lockheed Martin, where he worked on a classified voice-recognition program.

There he came across an unusual bit of self-replicating code designed to copy itself on to any floppy disk inserted into affected computers. When examined, it contained the message: ""Welcome to the dungeon. Beware of this VIRUS.""

""When I first read about the Pakistani Brain virus, I'd never heard of a virus before, neither had anyone in technology,"" remembers McAfee. ""It fascinated me.""

He worked out a way to disinfect the computers and then spread the cure via the bulletin board system, a precursor to the web.

The challenge inspired him to set up a business of his own: McAfee Associates - a firm that would later be sold, years after he had left, to Intel for more than $7.6bn (£4.7bn).

""I knew the field would become extremely large because people being who they are, there will always be hackers,"" he says.

""There's always going to be someone who likes you and someone who dislikes you. Someone who thinks you're a hero and some that think you're a villain John McAfee

""It's why we have graffiti on the walls of the inner city. People like to deface things. They like to disrupt things.

""So, given that fact, computer viruses were not going to go away and were only going to get worse. I just did what I could to be at the forefront of that industry for as long as I could.""

Despite this, he says, he has never himself used any of the products made by the firm that continues to bear his name.

""I'm constantly under attack, yet I use no software protection.

""I protect myself by constantly changing my IP [internet protocol] address, by not attaching my name to any device I use, and by not going on to sites where you might pick up a virus.

""Porn sites, for example, I just don't go there.

""Secondly, I practise safe computing. If someone sends me an email with a link, I'm not going there until I can call the person to verify that they sent me the email.

""It sounds absurd to live that way, but I would rather trust my own devices and thoughts than someone else's software.""

Image caption John McAfee says he has not taken drugs or drunk alcohol for nearly three decades

After selling his stake in the business in 1994, McAfee went on to found and sell other companies, including an instant messaging system, a firewall provider and a ranch from which he offered flights in ""trikes"" - low-flying, engine-powered cabins suspended from hang-gliders.

Then he headed south.

Research and raid

In 2008, at an age others might be thinking of putting up their feet, McAfee moved to the jungle of Belize with the stated intention of trying to cure another kind of infection.

""I came across a concept called quorum sensing, which is the technique that bacteria use to communicate with each other.

""Up until about 10 years ago we didn't even know that bacteria did communicate, but we find out they have a very sophisticated communication system. I wanted to explore and investigate that to see if we could come up with new antibiotics.""

He picked the area, he says, because the plants that grew along the country's Rio Nuevo river contained compounds that inhibit bacteria from sending chemical signals to each other and thus thwart their ability to co-ordinate an attack.

Things didn't go as planned.

The first sign of trouble was when journalists invited to his Carmelita, Orange Walk, base wrote stories that made clear they did not know what to make of the operation.

Then a falling-out with the microbiologist he was working with, Allison Adonizio, put the project at risk when she quit.

Dr Adonizio, who is now based in Philadelphia, did not want to be interviewed.

In April 2012, matters came to a head when the Belize police force's Gang Suppression Unit raided the research facility.

McAfee says the officers claimed they suspected it was being used to make the illegal psycho-stimulant methamphetamine.

They shot his dog, he says, confiscated both his passport and licensed weapons on the property, and briefly imprisoned him before dropping the charges.

""Under no circumstances did they really believe it was a meth lab,"" he states.

""Everybody knew it was a biotech lab because I had hired half of the people in the village to work there. They all knew what I was doing.

Image caption McAfee's Quorumex project attempted to create new treatments using plants from Belize's jungles

""It's a pirate haven. It's an extremely corrupt and dangerous place.

""I knew this and my friends all advised me against it. I just thought I was smart enough to sidestep it. Unfortunately, I was not.

""I was there for a year and the local politician sent a representative and asked for $2m for a campaign donation. I said no. Two weeks later they raided my compound.""

McAfee says when he was asked a second time for the cash he went on a publicity blitz, posting messages online, and speaking to local and international press about the incident. It became political.

The Belize Times - published by the leading opposition party - suggested the ""barbaric assault"" on McAfee was a ""global black eye"" for the nation and a threat to its tourist industry.

""I do wish that I were smarter socially,"" reflects McAfee.

""I think I have the ability to solve mathematical equations and programming issues very easily, but I am a little bit naive in some social situations. And certainly in Belize I was way naive.""

Image caption Amy Emshwiller moved with John McAfee to the Caribbean town of San Pedro

At the time of the raid, McAfee had begun an affair with a 16-year-old ex-prostitute he had met on Belize Independence Day.

""I was partying, I was drinking, and I went into this bar and the owner said a friend wants to meet me and likes me,"" remembers Amy Emshwiller, who still lives in Belize.

""[He said] can I have your number, and then two weeks later he called me.""

She says he was unaware she was less than a quarter of his age.

""He didn't know how old I was. I lied to him saying I was 18, and he thought it was OK.

I didn't quite realise that his lifestyle would be this older guy surrounded by young girls and bodyguards with guns Chad Essley, Graphic novelist

""I let him fall in love first before I told him my age.

""When I told him he was so [expletive] shocked that he didn't know what to do. He was baffled. And he was like: 'I still love you, I don't know what to do. I'm in love with a young girl.' That's how that happened.""

McAfee's long-term American girlfriend left him. And like many things in his life, the new affair proved complicated.

One night Emshwiller took McAfee's gun. She aimed it at his head, squeezed her eyes shut and pulled the trigger. She missed.

He continued the relationship.

""Amy, for one - and many girls in Belize - has a horrific story of abuse that if I told you, you could not believe it,"" McAfee explains.

""Of course she's not going to be well. Of course she's going to have issues.

""When she tried to shoot me in the head what I saw was a frightened child.

Image caption After the raid on his Carmelita property, McAfee moved to San Pedro on Ambergris Caye island

""What I saw was a confused girl who had been so abused - physically, sexually, emotionally - beyond any description.

""What are you going to do? Throw her out? That doesn't help her.

""All she did was burst my eardrum. I'm deaf in one ear now, but I don't have a bullet in my head. Forgiveness is one of the graces that we have as human beings. Can I be faulted for indulging in it?""

Emshwiller confirms the event but says she wanted to scare, not kill, him after he had said he wanted another girl. She adds it was not the only such incident provoked by her jealousy.

""One time before, I held him in the corner and I put a knife at his throat,"" she says.

""And he just said: 'Go ahead. Kill me.' And I couldn't do it. I just dropped the knife and walked out.""

Image caption Cartoonist Chad Essley is working on a graphic novel about McAfee which is due for release next year

Following the raid, McAfee and Emshwiller moved to his villa at San Pedro - a town on Belize's biggest island, Ambergris Caye - where they agreed to have an open relationship.

There they were visited by Chad Essley, a cartoonist, who began collaborating on a book about McAfee's life.

""I didn't quite realise that his lifestyle would be this older guy surrounded by young girls and bodyguards with guns,"" he says.

""Many of these girls were former prostitutes or had very rough lives.

""It was expressly forbidden to go out in the town and drink - the smell of alcohol, he could not be around it. He didn't want any of the girls doing any drugs at all.

""I interviewed each of these girls, got their background. They were incredibly sad. They were definitely in a better sort of situation being around John.""

Meanwhile next door, Gregory Faull, an Orlando sports bar owner who had recently divorced and decided to live in his Belize holiday home, was becoming increasingly irate at his neighbour's activities.

'Hatchet buried'

On Thursday, 8 November 2012, McAfee made the local headlines when he donated 40 stun guns, handcuffs and batons to the local police at a press conference.

Mayor Daniel Guerrero thanked him, stating: ""Crime is affecting the tourism industry as we have been listed on travel advisories; it is time to stop this. Let us protect our industry and turn San Pedro into the safe haven once more.""

That night the local TV bulletin declared that ""the hatchet was formally buried"", suggesting the rift between McAfee and Belize's authorities had ended.

Early on Sunday morning, Mr Faull was found dead in a pool of his blood by his housekeeper. Police called to the scene found a single 9mm shell nearby. They said a mobile phone and laptop were missing but there were no visible signs of a forced entry.

Image caption Gregory Faull was found shot dead at his home in Belize

The head of the police's Gang Suppression Unit told a local newspaper that his officers wanted to speak to McAfee as part of the investigation, but when they called at his house he did not appear to be in.

An article posted the following day by Wired magazine revealed why.

McAfee told the publication he had seen the officers approaching and had hidden in the sand of his property putting a cardboard box over his head.

He recalls that his caretaker had told him of Mr Faull's murder, and now he feared for his own life.

""The first thing that came to my mind was, 'Oh, my Lord. The government is finally trying to rid themselves of me,' he says.

""The government does from time to time.

""I had certainly been a huge thorn in their side, and they had simply got the wrong white man.

""Seriously, this is what went through my mind. My friends sort of calmed me down, and later said that's absurd. At the time I did not think so.""

McAfee acknowledges that he and Mr Faull had been at odds, but plays down the idea they hated each other or that he suspected him of being the person who had fed two of Emshwiller's dogs a poisoned tortilla.

""The entire five years I was there, I'd said maybe 15 words to him,"" he says.

""He did not like my dogs and the past two occasions I had seen him walking on the beach he complained. But so did everybody.

""There was no ongoing argument. Yeah, he was mad about my dogs. Maybe as I'm beginning to think now, maybe he was the one who poisoned them. At the time I certainly did not believe that.""

Image caption John McAfee dyed his hair black as part of one of his disguises

In fact, as ABC News later revealed, Mr Faull had filed a complaint to Mayor Guerrero about McAfee the previous month.

It said McAfee's dog had attacked a tourist; that his security guards had ""terrified"" other residents by walking around with shotguns and shining lights in their eyes, and that taxis and other traffic had been arriving at his property ""at all hours"", causing a disturbance.

""I did not find that out until weeks after I came back to the States,"" says McAfee when pressed about this.

""Belize is not like America where you file a complaint and then the police come out and chase things out. You file a complaint and it goes into a drawer.""

Hiding out

McAfee then went on the run, saying he feared he would be ""silenced"" if he was caught and thrown in jail.

It made headlines worldwide, in no small part due to the fact that he was posting updates to a blog and giving frequent interviews - actions he says were designed to ensure he couldn't be made to disappear if he had been caught.

Image caption Prime Minister Dean Barrow said it was ""utter and complete nonsense"" that the police wanted to kill McAfee

""I disguised myself as a ragged salesman,"" he recalls.

""All it takes is some dirty clothes and not bathing for a few days and not combing my hair.

""You know, people saw my photograph everywhere because all of the police and army had it for that month and a half I was underground. I just made sure I looked different than that.""

Questioned about the affair, Dean Barrow, Belize's prime minister, made it clear McAfee was not an official murder suspect, and had only been classed instead a ""person of interest"".

""I don't want to be unkind to the gentleman, but I believe he is extremely paranoid, even bonkers,"" the politician added.

Belize and corruption The BBC put Mr McAfee's claims of corruption to the Belize government, which is currently embroiled in a scandal involving the issue of a passport to a South Korean man who had never visited the country. It sent this reply: Belize has made great strides in improving transparency and ethical behaviour across all government departments. Where any sniff of corruption and evidence of such has been proven, the prime minister and the government have moved swiftly to stamp it out. This has most recently been demonstrated by the sacking of the junior minister of immigration. The US government and the Commonwealth have been instrumental in supporting Belize in addressing governance issues as we work to reduce even the appearance of fraud and corruption. Corruption is a cancer that Belize will continue to correct - it has no place in government or in any public office and we do not and will not tolerate it. The past is the past and this Belize government cannot change the behaviour of previous administrations or officials, but the prime minister has vowed to root out corruption wherever and whenever it occurs.

During this time McAfee continued to see Emshwiller.

""When he was on the run I went for lunches with him and then he would call and say: 'Come to this place, or go there,' she recalls.

""How to come, when to come. Not to go out, or stay home, or go to a different location. He would tell me that so nobody would get me.""

She adds that she regrets she did not go with him when he finally decided to escape the country.

The next major development came on 3 December when a reporter and photographer from Vice magazine revealed they were documenting McAfee's life on the run.

In what proved a frustrating twist for the tech guru, they then unwittingly revealed he had crossed the border to Guatemala - a fact revealed by a photo uploaded to the Vice website by staff at its headquarters, who failed to wipe its location data.

""I had gone out of my way to arrange the escape and I was breathing easily and looking forward to a few days of relaxation,"" remembers McAfee.

""We immediately had to go on the run again because we were in Guatemala illegally at this point. But it was no-one's real fault. It was just the fault of the moment.""

A few days later McAfee was arrested. There was initially speculation he would be sent back to Belize, but a week later he was allowed to fly to Miami a free man.

""After it was over I asked myself, 'Good Lord, I must have been afraid,'"" he says.

""But I really can't remember. I remember merely trying to solve the problems that occurred as they occurred.""

Hero and villain

McAfee has offered a $25,000 bounty for information relating to Mr Faull's death, but says an attempt to contact the victim's family proved unsuccessful.

The family has called the reward a ""hollow gesture"" and suggested if McAfee really wanted to help he would have met with the Belize police.

Image caption John McAfee continued to give interviews even when being held by the Guatemalan authorities

A spokesman for the country's government said its authorities still wanted to speak to the businessman.

""Mr McAfee's claims and his behaviour have been extreme,"" he told the BBC.

""The investigation is ongoing and McAfee remains a person of interest. If McAfee were to respond to questioning it would make a difference to the progress of the investigation - but this is currently out of the hands of the government of Belize.""

So long as the crime remains unsolved, it is inevitable the entrepreneur will always face suspicion. But he says he can live with that.

""There's always going to be someone who likes you and someone who dislikes you,"" he says.

""Someone who thinks you're a hero and some that think you're a villain. You know I just do what I can in situations like this to continue to state that I'm totally innocent.""

That doesn't mean he is trying to forget his time in Belize.

In addition to the graphic novel, he is working with a Canadian firm to make both a documentary and a movie about his time there.

He adds that George Jung - the imprisoned cocaine drugs lord portrayed by Johnny Depp in the film Blow - has been picked to write his biography.

While those projects brew, McAfee has returned to Silicon Valley, announcing the forthcoming launch of a $100 gadget that he promises can make you invisible on the net.

""If you cannot see it, you cannot hack it, you cannot look at it, you cannot spy on anything happening inside it,"" he explains.

He says the D-Central units will fit in people's pockets and allow their phones, tablets and PCs to communicate with other owners' devices within a three-block radius.

Image caption John McAfee is working with a Canadian company to make a documentary about his life

He adds they can also connect to the net anonymously via a node - a separate piece of equipment attached to the network - either directly or with their encrypted data relayed relayed via other D-Central boxes.

Each will frequently change their network identifier - a long number used by devices as an ID - making them hard to track, he explains.

He suggests it will appeal to college students who want to copy music anonymously and to businesses wanting to prevent the theft of corporate secrets.

He's also well aware that in the light of Edward Snowden's leaks about surveillance techniques used by the US and UK governments, part of the appeal will be thwarting their efforts.

""You know from their own paranoia and desire to stay in power, they are watching everything they can,"" he says.

Will the tech work? Will he really frustrate the authorities once again?

At this point, like so much of John McAfee's life, it's impossible to be sure of all the facts and it's ultimately up to you whether you take him at his word.","['head', 'came', 'runaway', 'addict', 'caption', 'going', 'im', 'john', 'belize', 'mcafees', 'mcafee', 'later', 'coder']","Who is the real John McAfee?

'What I learned from confronting my alcoholic mum',Caitlin Croft was 12 when she first tried to talk to her mum Tracey about her alcohol problem.,,None,"Caitlin Croft was 12 when she first tried to talk to her mum Tracey about her alcohol problem.

Every afternoon after work, Tracey would lock herself in her room and drink until she fell asleep, normally having a bottle of vodka a night.

Caitlin, now 17, found it hard to confront her mum. But it was worthwhile because, after more than a decade of addiction, Tracey's now in recovery and hasn't had a drink for eight months.

Here's what Caitlin has learned.

Anyone can have alcohol problems

Seeing her mum's struggle with alcohol made Caitlin realise that anyone can get addicted.

""When you picture an alcoholic you don't think of an 'ordinary' person,"" says Caitlin.

""You'd think of a homeless person having those problems, not a normal average person with a family and home.""

But it's not uncommon. The government says around 1.6 million adults in England have some level of alcohol dependence.

And almost 11 million are drinking enough to harm their health.

Despite drinking heavily every night, Tracey managed to keep her job.

So from the outside it may not have been obvious she had a problem.

Ignoring the addiction won't make it go away

For several months Caitlin avoided talking to her mum about her addiction.

""Every night I'd be in my room on my own, and I knew my mum would be next door drunk,"" she explains.

""I told myself so many times that if I just ignore it she'll get better. But I just saw it getting worse.""

I told myself so many times that if I just ignore it she'll get better

So Caitlin says she learned to confront Tracey in the mornings when she was sober, instead of talking to her while she was drunk.

""Then she could understand me a bit more,"" she says.

""I learned that it's easier to get everything out in the open, rather than hiding it and pretending it will just go away.""

Make sure you've got evidence

Telling someone they've got an alcohol problem is a serious thing to do.

You need to think carefully about what you will say to them, Caitlin explains.

""I couldn't just accuse mum of being drunk.

She thought she was hiding it, but I knew when she was drunk

""I didn't know what type of mood she would be in, so I always used to plan in my head how I was going to [approach her].""

She says she realised that her mum may not have known how much she was drinking.

""She was in denial and she thought she was hiding it, but I knew when she was drunk.

""So I used to tear her room apart looking for bottles.

""I found 10, 20 bottles hidden under her bed, under her pillow, in her drawers.

""Then I had evidence. It was clear she had been drinking, and then it was harder for her to deny it.""

Tracey tells Newsbeat this approach helped her confront her problem. But it wouldn't work for everyone with alcohol dependency.

Encourage them to get help

Tracey started to drink heavily after her husband left the family.

""Over time I started to understand why she had a drink problem,"" explains Caitlin.

A lot of people don't understand that it's an illness

""It affected my mum's health - mentally, physically and emotionally.""

Caitlin and her older brothers encouraged their mum to seek medical help.

Tracey's drinking had left her with an inflamed liver, a condition which can be life threatening.

She was also suffering mental problems, and ended up spending a lot of time in hospital.

""A lot of people don't understand that it's an illness, just like anything else you get diagnosed with.

""So even though it's hard you have to see it from their point of view.""

Get support for yourself, too

Alcohol dependency doesn't just damage the person who is drinking. It affects everyone around them.

""It's not nice to see your mum in that position and there's not really a lot you can do to help,"" says Caitlin.

""It was tiring to see her not making any improvements.""

Caitlin says she found it helpful to talk to her friends and to her older brothers.

And she moved in with one of them when Tracey's illness was at its worst, which helped her concentrate on the other parts of her life like revising for her GCSEs.

Together, the family helped Tracey to get better.

Links to help and advice

You can get advice about alcohol on the BBC Advice pages.

Support groups and helplines are offered by a number of organisations in the UK including Al-Anon (linked to the Alcoholics Anonymous organisation) and DrugFam.

The National Association for Children of Alcoholics and Children of Addicted Parents groups can also offer support and advice.

London 2012: Team GB football team begin preparations,BBC Sport catches up with Team GB's footballers as manager Stuart Pearce's side start their preparations for the Olympics.,,2012-07-09 12:49:32,"While much of the nation's gaze on Sunday was focused on historic events at Wimbledon, a few miles north west another unique sporting occasion was taking place.

The Great Britain men's Olympic football squad were in Loughborough for their kitting out day - a process that involves every British Olympian receiving the attire they will wear during competition.

For the 18 selected it was a unique occasion that coach Stuart Pearce said they would be unlikely to experience again.

The group met as a unit for the first time at dinner on Saturday.

Men's Olympic football - recent winners Beijing 2008: Argentina Athens 2004: Argentina Sydney 2000: Cameroon Atlanta 1996: Nigeria Barcelona 1992: Spain

""We didn't have to introduce ourselves like at Alcoholics Anonymous,"" Swansea defender Neil Taylor, 23, told BBC Sport.

Joking aside, Taylor said the squad would have to ""gel quickly"" with less than three weeks before they begin their group campaign against Senegal at Old Trafford on 26 July.

Pearce was given the responsibility of putting together the squad. His selection caused controversy, with the exclusion of former England captain David Beckham from the final 18 and with no representation from Northern Ireland or Scotland.

The ex-England full-back had already given his reasons for leaving out London 2012 ambassador Beckham and added on Sunday that he did not pick the team based on nationality but ""on form"". Had he been forced to do so he would not have taken the job.

One of those favoured by Pearce, but left out of England coach Roy Hodgson's Euro 2012 squad, was Manchester City full-back Micah Richards.

Does he have a point to prove?

Man City's Micah Richards is hoping to repay Pearce's faith in him.

""No. Of course, as footballers you want to play at Worlds Cups. This is an added bonus and will probably never happen again, so to be part of this is amazing,"" said the 23-year-old.

""Pearce gave me my debut at City, then when he got the England job for a game, he played me. I have so much respect for him and will give all for the man who gave me a chance.""

Someone who did make the Euro 2012 squad was goalkeeper Jack Butland.

The Birmingham teenager, who spent last season on loan at Cheltenham, was a late call-up by Hodgson, following an injury to John Ruddy, and will be vying with Middlesbrough's Jason Steele for the keeper's jersey at London 2012.

""The Euros was a fantastic experience,"" he said.

""It would have taken a miracle to play out there. I was going as back-up. That's probably the main reason I am here - the fact I didn't play.""

Other positions that will be hotly contested will be those in midfield, with Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey, Manchester United's Tom Cleverly and Swansea's Joe Allen all fighting to play alongside captain Ryan Giggs.

All were in buoyant mood, although Tottenham left-back Danny Rose had mixed feelings about spending time away from White Hart Lane, where he - and team-mate Steven Caulker - could be making an impression on new boss Andre Villas-Boas.

""I want to show what I can do. It had been agreed by Spurs that I could go on a season-long loan deal to a Premier League club, but that was before manager Harry Redknapp was sacked,"" he said.

""It's a great achievement being here, but at the same time there's a new manager at Spurs and all the lads will be making impressions on him while me and Steve will be here. But I am delighted about being part of this.""","['football', 'london', 'taylor', 'gb', 'team', 'taken', 'begin', 'probably', 'preparations', 'pearce', 'unique', 'spurs', 'squad', 'olympic', 'play', 'england']","The Great Britain men's Olympic football squad were in Loughborough for their kitting out day - a process that involves every British Olympian receiving the attire they will wear during competition.

Drinkers 'ignorant' about alcohol,,,2008-05-19 01:31:20,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement Three-quarters of drinkers do not know a typical glass of wine contains three units of alcohol, a survey for the Department of Health suggests. The YouGov survey of 1,429 drinkers in England found more than a third did not know their recommended daily limit - 2-3 units for women and 3-4 for men. The survey coincides with a government campaign to promote careful drinking. Ministers are concerned people are unaware that glass sizes have increased and some drinks have become stronger. The internet survey found half those questioned drank alcohol at least two or three times a week. And although 82% said they knew what a unit of alcohol was, 77% did not know how many units were in a typical large glass of wine. GPs are used to hearing half truths about half measures - people need to have a better grasp of how much they're drinking by adding up their units

Professor Steve Field, Royal College of GPs

Alcohol units Drinking diaries More than half (55%) thought a large glass of wine would contain two units, when it actually contains three. Nearly three out of five (58%) did not know a double gin and tonic contains two units. More than a third (35%) did not know that an average pint of beer (ABV 4%) contains more than two units - although some strong lagers contain three units. And 36% of women and 50% of men knew their recommended daily drinking limits were 2-3 units and 3-4 units respectively. The Office of National Statistics revamped its assessment method to take into account the increased glass sizes and strength of alcoholic drinks last December. Ordinary families The Know Your Limits campaign aims to tell drinkers how many units are now in their drinks and help them stick to their recommended limits. Some lagers contain three units There is a series of new adverts on television, radio and newspapers showing the number of units in individual drinks. The adverts use ordinary family situations to help people understand how many units are in typical alcoholic drinks and warns them how too much regular drinking can damage their health. Public Health Minister Dawn Primarolo said people are not necessarily aware of how much they drink and how much it can harm their health. ""Glass sizes have grown larger and the strength of many wines and beers has increased, so it's no wonder some of us have lost track of our alcohol consumption. ""We aim to give people the facts about how many units are in different drinks in a non-judgemental way. Then they can then make their own assessments about how much they want to drink in the future."" Older drinkers Mrs Primarolo said the campaign was aimed at over 25s who were less aware of what a unit was than younger people. Some 32% of drinkers aged 18-24 correctly said that a large glass of wine contains three units, compared with just 18% of drinkers over 55. Royal College of General Practitioners chairman Professor Steve Field said: ""When it comes to alcohol GPs are used to hearing half truths about half measures. HAVE YOUR SAY I don't have a clue how many units are in most drinks, but I do know when I have had enough Joe Delaney, London ""People need to have a better grasp of how much they're drinking by adding up their units. ""Alcohol can be a major contributing factor in many health disorders so it's vital that people think about how much alcohol they drink,"" he said. Joe Korner, from The Stroke Association, said the organisation fully supports efforts to make people aware of the health risks associated with excessive drinking. ""There are around 1,100 haemorrhagic stroke deaths every year associated with alcohol and statistics show that women who drink over double their recommended limits are more than four times likely to suffer a stroke, and men almost twice as likely,"" he said. Mark Hastings, of the British Beer and Pub Association, said: ""We fully support the aim of giving people information on which to make their own decisions. ""But the government needs to be careful not to target the sensible majority while failing to tackle abuse by the minority. ""What people need is realistic advice and sensible action, not interference with their own judgement.""

Larne man avoids prison for attack on Alliance Party office,A County Antrim man who broke into an Alliance Party constituency office with an axe and crowbar is given a suspended sentence.,,None,"A County Antrim man has avoided prison for breaking into an Alliance Party office with an axe and crowbar.

Charles Mervyn Jamison, 39, from Old Glenarm Road, Larne, pleaded guilty to burglary with intent to cause unlawful damage.

He was given a 12 month sentence, suspended for three years.

The judge at Antrim Crown Court said the act of ""wanton vandalism"" was an ""attack on the right of people to freely hold their political views"".

The court heard that Jamison was arrested on 19 July 2013, after police received a report of a ""smashing sound"" coming from the rear of a property on Larne's Main Street.

Dislike

They entered the property through a broken window and found Jamison inside the main hall of the premises, where an Alliance Party office is also located.

A prosecuting lawyer said: ""The defendant was holding an axe and crowbar and was smashing the door and lock of the door to the Alliance Party office.

""He gave the impression of being very intoxicated and was arrested. Asked why he was attacking the office, he said, 'I just don't like the Alliance Party'.

""He admitted during interview that the axe and crowbar were his and he intended to enter the office and trash it.

""He apologised for his actions. He was literally caught red-handed.""

The prosecutor added that the incident was not part of a ""planned or orchestrated campaign"".

A defence barrister said the incident was ""utterly and completely disgraceful"".

""Mr Jamison works in a fishing tackle shop in the same building and, for whatever reason, which was associated with the consumption of alcohol, committed this offence.""

The defence lawyer confirmed to the court that Jamison had worked as a coach builder for ten years but had to give it up after he fell ill with epilepsy.

'Distress'

He said he was working part-time and had saved up the money to repay what is owed for the office repairs.

""To show how he has progressed, he has not consumed alcohol since this incident, he is voluntarily attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and he has not come to the attention of the police since.""

The judge told Jamison: ""It has been made very clear that you were not part of any orchestrated campaign against the Alliance Party office or the Alliance Party in general.

""That is not to lessen the distress that would have been caused to persons who worked in that office, while you worked part-time in a fishing tackle shop in the same premises.

""There is no doubt these persons and anyone attending the office in which they are entitled to do would have been quite rightly distressed by this wanton vandalism by this defendant.""

He added that Jamison had shown an ""element of remorse"" through his early guilty plea and that had he contested the case, the defendant would have been sentenced to 18 months in prison.

On top of the 12 month sentence, suspended for three years, the judge ordered the destruction of the axe and crowbar and also granted a compensation order of £1,390 to the landlord of the property.","['larne', 'party', 'crowbar', 'man', 'prison', 'property', 'judge', 'attack', 'avoids', 'jamison', 'worked', 'alliance', 'office', 'axe', 'incident']","A County Antrim man has avoided prison for breaking into an Alliance Party office with an axe and crowbar.

Life inside a sex addiction clinic in the UK,,,2010-04-05 03:05:32,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. UK sex addiction clinics are reporting a rise in the number of people seeking help, a fact being linked to golfer Tiger Woods admitting his affairs. BBC Reporter Gavin Lee was given access to one of the few sex addiction clinics in the UK. The group begins in a similar way to how I'd expect an alcoholics anonymous meeting to start. The clients sit together in a circle, and the first to speak is 27-year-old Danny James from Liverpool. ""Hi, I'm Danny. I'm a sex addict."" Danny used to live in Blackpool and speaks openly about how he destroyed his relationship with his girlfriend and daughter because of his addiction. ""You could liken it to a drug. The hit after sex, I'd start to need that feeling more and more. After a while that feeling wouldn't last as long so you'd do it again and again. ""I started losing work, because I was concentrating on going out finding people to sleep with. Every day, I'd be straight into a pub, on the job and it wasn't that hard to find in Blackpool cause it's what most people come here looking for anyway, with hen nights and so on. It was kind of put on a plate."" Childhood issues That cycle led to Danny breaking up from his partner and losing contact with his daughter. He lost his business and says he was depressed and disgusted with himself. ""It was only from going to therapy I realised there was something wrong. With me, there was a lot of back issues from my childhood. We went into those issues and rebuilt my life. ""I know it sounds daft but I did things like going to the zoo with somebody and just learn how to be normal again."" It got to the point where one of my parents would stay at home to keep an eye on me because they knew about the suicide attempts

Danny, sex addict Danny attends the Steven Pope Therapy Clinic in Blackpool every week, which costs him £40 an hour. Paul is another self-confessed sex addict. He is a quiet member of the group and is reluctant to take part in discussions. He said it started through boredom when he started to search for explicit content on his computer, which led to buying hundreds of DVDs and magazines. He described his condition as obsessive, which also led him to become deeply depressed. 'Woods effect' The centre has taken on 52 new clients in the past two months, compared with only a handful each month last year. This rise appears to be reflected across the small number of sex addiction clinics in the UK. Therapists say the many new clients have cited celebrities such as Tiger Woods as the inspiration for them to seek help. Golfer Tiger Woods' many affairs have been highly publicised Steve Pope, who owns the therapy clinic in Blackpool, says the interest from people wanting help has been unprecedented. ""People are now coming forward to talk their issues through. Woods on one side has been to hell and back, as his family has, but he's saved lives and that's the Tiger Woods effect."" The Association for the Treatment of Sexual Addiction and Compulsivity, a professional body set up to support research into sex addiction, has also recorded a rise in the number British clients seeking help. Paula Hall, who is in charge of the service said many professionals were now looking for further training in this field. ""They're having more and more clients coming to them looking for services and up until now there's been little or no training for this in the UK."" 'Troublesome' behaviour The treatment in the UK is based on methods used in the US where sexual behaviour therapy is big business. However, the term is not technically recognised as a medical illness. Professor Glen Wilson, a specialist in sexual behaviour at Gresham College, dismisses the idea that it could be an addiction. ""Whatever the celebs have we all think we ought to have as well, and of course the drug companies will want to get in on the act too. Once a behaviour has been medicalised they will come up with pills for it,"" he says. I think to say that sex addiction doesn't exist is a real insult to the many intelligent men and women who suffer from the condition every day

Paula Hall, psychotherapist ""There are tremendous pressures on medicalising behaviour which is no more than troublesome. It's not the same as drug addiction because it's not a hijacking of the circuits by a chemical, it is what the circuits were set up for. ""That is rewarding you for sexual behaviour which has reproductive and survival significance."" Many medical experts hold a similar opinion towards the term sex addiction. But Paula Hall, who's a trained psychotherapist, says she vehemently disagrees with their analysis and believes the problem has not been researched properly. ""The people out there still saying this does not exist do not understand the condition. ""It is not about sex, it's about that dependency and that compulsion, and I think to say that sex addiction doesn't exist is a real insult to the many intelligent men and women who suffer from the condition every day."" Despite the lack of recognition for the term sex addict, the clients in Blackpool say for them the addiction is all too real. The feelings are put into some perspective when I ask Danny what he thinks his life would be life without therapy. ""I'd be dead,"" he says. ""There's no two ways about it. ""It got to the point where one of my parents would stay at home to keep an eye on me because they knew about the suicide attempts. I would have gone through with it. I'd be dead.""

Mel Gibson says he survived 'public humiliation',,,2010-01-20 11:57:31,"Gibson presented the best director award at Sunday's Golden Globes Mel Gibson says he has been made stronger by the ""public humiliation"" of his drink-drive arrest in 2006. Gibson's arrest sparked outrage after a leaked police report quoted him making anti-Semitic comments to the arresting officer in California, who was Jewish. ""You ask anybody what their number one fear is and it's public humiliation,"" he told the UK's Mirror newspaper. ""Multiply that on a global scale and that's what I've been through. It changes you,"" he added. But the Lethal Weapon star was philosophical about his troubles, saying: ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. It's really that simple."" ""You can't do anything but live in the moment and leave the future in the hands of providence and don't regret the past too much. Maybe just take a lesson from it."" Mexico argument Gibson's conviction for drink-driving was erased last October, after he successfully completed probation. The actor had been ordered to perform public service work and attend Alcoholics Anonymous for three years. He has reportedly given up drinking entirely since his arrest. But Golden Globes host Ricky Gervais made a dig at his expense during Sunday night's award ceremony, joking: ""I like a drink as much as the next man... unless the next man is Mel Gibson."" The 54-year-old took it in his stride, pretending to slur his words as he took to the stage to present the best director prize. Gibson will return to UK cinemas later this month, playing his first on-screen role in eight years, in political thriller Edge Of Darkness. The star, who won a best director Oscar in 1995 for Braveheart, is also preparing to film his own screenplay, How I Spent My Summer Vacation, in Mexico. The movie, which tells the story of a career criminal who is arrested and placed in a tough prison, has caused upset in Mexico after plans were announced to move inmates from a real-life prison to allow filming to take place. Hundreds of people demonstrated outside the Ignacio Allende prison in the Gulf coast city of Veracruz after learning their relatives would be transferred, making visits more difficult. Gibson told the Mirror he had not requested the prison to be emptied. ""No-one asked for them to be transferred,"" he said. ""It was a decision by the Mexican authorities.""

Communications Bill: Data access 'vital' anti-gang tool,"Government plans to monitor all Britons' online activity will help police to infiltrate criminal gangs, Parliament is told.",,None,"Image caption Ministers argue law enforcement agencies need to keep pace with changing technology

Government plans to monitor all Britons' online activity will help police to infiltrate criminal gangs, Parliament has been told.

Ministers want to strengthen the law on internet data retention to help the police tackle security threats.

Peter Fahy, Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, said access to data could help ""capture people further up the tree"" in organised gangs.

Home Secretary Theresa May will face questions on the issue on Wednesday.

Under the government's plans, currently being scrutinised by Parliament, service providers will have to store details of internet use in the UK for a year to allow police and intelligence services to access it.

New platforms

Records will include people's activity on social network sites, webmail, internet phone calls and online gaming.

Civil liberties campaigners and MPs from all parties have expressed concerns about the scope of the new powers.

But giving evidence to the parliamentary committee studying the proposals, Mr Fahy said getting access to basic details of who was talking to whom were ""absolutely vital"" in ""proving associations"" between criminals.

Data Communications Bill The Bill extends the range of data telecoms firms will have to store for up to 12 months

It will include for the first time details of messages sent on social media, webmail, voice calls over the internet and gaming in addition to emails and phone calls

The data includes the time, duration, originator and recipient of a communication and the location of the device from which it is made

It does not include the content of messages - what is being said. Officers will need a warrant to see that

But they will not need the permission of a judge to see details of the time and place of messages provided they are investigating a crime or protecting national security

Four bodies will have access to data: police, the Serious and Organised Crime Agency, the intelligence agencies and HM Revenue and Customs

Local authorities will face restrictions on the kinds of data they can access

In his force's fight against organised crime in Manchester, Sir Peter said it was often able to penetrate the top of a criminal gang by linking ""foot soldiers"" selling drugs or stolen goods to those running operations.

But he said he was ""very fearful"" about the authorities' ability to keep track of suspects in future as they changed their behaviour and used social media and other less traceable channels to interact.

""What you are trying to prove is associations between different groups of criminals,"" he said.

""Up to now we have been able to use the more readily available communications data but criminals are realising that and moving to new technology and platforms.

""We already have specific examples of them using new platforms to defeat us.""

Asked to give details of the new methods that criminals were using, Sir Peter said he was reluctant to reveal too much since offenders could be listening to the hearing, but he identified online ""gaming platforms"" as a growing concern.

Although many internet service providers were ""very co-operative"" at the moment in responding to police requests for information, others were ""essentially obstructive"", he said, and this needed to change.

Privacy risk

Giving evidence earlier on Tuesday, a leading IT executive said there were ""big downsides"" to the government's proposals ""in terms of people having their privacy invaded"".

Trefor Davies, chief technology officer of business-focused service provider Timico Limited, said high-profile data losses by government departments and banks in recent years showed information held by the state and private firms could not be regarded as totally secure.

Citing the example of someone visiting the Alcoholics Anonymous website, he said sensitive information was at risk of being compromised if details of online behaviour were stored on a database and then a laptop containing information was left in the back of a cab. He said: ""This kind of information will escape.""

While the industry wanted to help the authorities to ""catch crooks"" and prevent mass terrorist attacks, he said there needed to be serious debate about the privacy implications of the proposals.

Privacy campaigner Guy Hosein, from Privacy International, said police and other public authorities already had access to the information, and there was no need for new legislation. ""This data is already collected here in this country,"" he said.","['bill', 'online', 'data', 'access', 'authorities', 'social', 'vital', 'tool', 'details', 'antigang', 'information', 'help', 'communications', 'internet', 'need']","Ministers want to strengthen the law on internet data retention to help the police tackle security threats.

Lots of readers have been commenting on the short clip of Sirga the lioness rushing to hug the man who rescued her when she was a cub. When Valentin Gruener opens her cage, Sirga ecstatically throws her paws around his neck. Allan Ainsworth says on Facebook that it shows ""animals know - and recognise - kindness"". It reminds him of a story ""where two fellas had a lion cub from Harrods"". Allan recalls that the lion was rehoused in Africa. ""The two guys went out some time later… It threw itself at them both in an embrace of love and fondness."" Allan has remembered correctly, and in that reunion in 1972, Christian the lion reacts in a very similar way to Sirga.

Scoop of the 60s

Here's an unusual way to get a scoop: hide your camera in a bouzouki guitar. One tip though, this may only work if you're trying to get a story in the kind of place where there are actually bouzouki players. Stumped for the kind of place where there are bouzouki guitars? Try a Greek shipping magnate's yacht. That's where young Greek journalist Nico Mastorakis sneaked on to get the scoop that Jackie Kennedy was going to marry Aristotle Onassis. For Christiane Vejlo this was an insight into the early days of paparazzi work, while Joanna Williams thinks it tells us something about press freedom 40 years ago.

How's this for deciding what tax rate to pay. Alex Duval Smith walked into the tax office and was told, ''You have the choice between two income tax regimens, 30% or 3%, which shall it be?'' She went for 3%. And that's how they do tax in Mali. There's a logic to this. The government believes the 3% rate will attract more tax payers. At the moment they struggle to raise 1% or 2%. So this new rate represents something of an increase, she's told.

Just prior to the introduction of the 30mph speed limit in the UK, there were only around one-tenth of the cars on the road today, but four times as many associated deaths. There had been a 20mph speed limit set in 1903 but it was repealed in 1930. The spate of deaths caused a change of heart in government in 1934 and the 30mph limit was brought in. But it still has its opponents. They argue speed limits don't improve safety because drivers just focus on speedometers. Transport researcher Anna Plyushteva responds to that argument on Twitter with one word: hilarity.

Fidelity in marriage is written into French civil law. So given this, is it illegal for a dating website to promote adultery? That is the question underlying a lawsuit targeting the French company Gleeden. In Article 212 of the Civil Code, it states: ""Married partners owe each other the duty of respect, fidelity, help and assistance."" Meanwhile, Gleeden's advertising campaign is a woman in a wedding dress with her fingers crossed behind her back. Indeed, Gleeden says 80% of the people who use it are indeed married. On Facebook, Hilary Banks points out that this isn't a solely French phenomenon - English dating sites have an option in their ""what are you looking for"" section which is ""married, looking for sex"".

It was an eight-second clip and had been watched over four million times. But her reaction is surprising. She started her own YouTube channel to let people know who the person behind the ""World's Ugliest Woman"" video really was. Tweeters were inspired by her story of triumphing over adversity.

Mr McDonald, of Iddesleigh Terrace, Dawlish, Devon, denies murdering her but has admitted killing her.

Mrs McDonald, 36, was attacked after going to his flat in January while the couple were negotiating an acrimonious break-up.

'Praying for her'

The court heard that when the marriage broke down Mr McDonald went to live in a flat they owned while Sophie and their three children stayed at the family home in Elm Grove Road.

Mrs McDonald's mother Elizabeth Brook was in contact with her on the day she was killed and told the court: ""I got a text at 14:35 saying she was going to see James at the flat.

""I texted back saying I was praying for her. She sent a message back a minute later saying she was feeling wobbly but was looking forward to seeing friends that night.

""I was going to text her back and ask her to take someone with her but I got distracted and never sent it. The next thing I knew was a call from her oldest daughter at about 16:15 asking if I knew where Sophie was.""

The jury have been shown an agreed timeline of events which included texts from Mr McDonald in which he alleged his wife was being unfaithful.

Statements from friends have revealed Sophie had joined the Dawlish Christian Fellowship and was going to Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings to address drink and drug problems.

The Secret Footballer: I want to 'out' myself - but fear I'll be sued,"The Secret Footballer says ""everyone wants to out"" him. He would even quite like to do it himself but fears legal action.",,2018-04-10 10:56:45,"The Secret Footballer thought about taking his life during a thunderstorm

He is the former Premier League footballer behind four anonymous books which give behind the scenes insight into the game.

But the self-styled Secret Footballer says people are desperate to ""out him"".

He admits he would even quite like to do it himself - but the fear of legal action and bankruptcy are the things keeping the Secret Footballer's identity a secret.

Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live's At Home With Colin Murray, he discusses the time he tried to be hit by lightning, and breaking his five-year abstinence to share a drink with famous chef Keith Floyd.

'If I stand under that, that will be it'

The Secret Footballer was still playing as late as 2011. He is English, has played for at least two Premier League clubs and was relegated from the top flight on the final day of the season. He once booked out the top floor of a hotel in Paris because he heard that someone he didn't like was staying there.

After he stopped playing, he started a column, and wrote four books. In 2010 he was diagnosed with depression and at one stage he considered taking his own life after struggling with mental health.

I was really low. We lived next to a farmers' field and there was a power cable that runs across the field with a big power box in one corner.

My wife was out and I remember walking out of the house in just my football shorts and there was all this thunder and lightning around me. I had no top on and I was barefoot. There was one beautiful oak tree in the middle of this field and I remember walking towards that thinking ""if I stand under that, that will be it"".

As I was walking towards it, this bolt of lightning hit the power box and it exploded. It was spectacular. It knocked all the power out in the houses and that snapped me out of it and I went back inside.

I told my wife a year later what happened but by then I was kind of coming out of it. If I had got to that tree and that was that, at that moment I would not have cared.

'The more money around, the more anxious it makes you'

The former Premier League footballer believes his writing saved his life and steered him away from the temptations of alcohol following his career. He talks about the difficulties faced by those who leave the game, be it alcoholism, divorce, or mental health issues.

What you should consider is that when you retire on the Sunday, by the Monday you lose all your mates and all the admiration of the fans. Everything goes off the cliff. Football is completely irreplaceable.

The moment you stopped, all the temptation was there. I didn't drink for five years but one of my heroes, Keith Floyd, was doing a show at a theatre and I couldn't not have a glass of wine with Keith Floyd so that was what broke my ban.

The more money around the more anxious it made you, and you get paranoid about everything because if you don't have anything you have nothing to lose.

You have got to try and keep yourself stimulated. I was lucky that the writing actually gave me something to do.

Keith Floyd shared a glass of wine with The Secret Footballer

'They are going to make a TV drama on the books'

The Secret Footballer grew up on a council estate in rural England and only began playing organised football relatively late. He signed his first professional terms at the age of 21 and had what he describes as a lucrative career. Since retiring, though, he has become more prominent - albeit anonymously - with a column in the Guardian, the publication of his books and, potentially, a television drama.

Some of the most interesting ex-players I have met do not have a profile.

I think that the secret footballer was a good idea and one that was well worth exploring. There was an explosion in help for mental illness after the first book and the Football Association and the Professional Footballers' Association decided to act on it, so I'm kind of proud of it. But I think I ran away with it without thinking where I wanted to take it.

Everyone wants to out me but only I'm going to do that. The issue would be a legal one and I would probably have to bankrupt myself in order to survive. You have to prepare for the worst and, while there are no names in the books, there's a lot of money in football and a lot of people with a lot of money. They don't even have to be proved right they just have to put a case on.

My autobiography will sell on the back of me outing myself but I can't do it at the moment even though I want to.

Election Lexicon: The lost significance behind this week’s buzzwords,A look behind some of the words that are making an impact in the general election campaign this week.,,None,"Image copyright PA Image caption Monsieur Zen (self-proclaimed)

Every general election throws up buzzwords and curiosities which help to define the tenor of the campaign. So what words have caught the ear in week one of the 2017 contest?

Battle bus

Conservative candidates and officials learned this week that they would not face charges for breaches of expenses rules over use of a ""battle bus"".

But what precisely is a battle bus?

The exterior is grimly familiar: a shiny patina of party logos and rudimentary slogans.

But when the battle bus was first used in the UK, its insides were to change politics irrevocably.

Rather than have their spouses drive them to campaigning events, politicians of the late 1970s could travel in a six-wheeled office with state-of-the-art equipment - and not just the air conditioning.

Here's Margaret Thatcher with some unimaginably futuristic communications technology:

The perks were even greater for political journalists, who no longer had to drive in clumsy convoy with the party leaders or search for telephone booths to file their reports.

They too could stay connected - and as the kit advanced to the word processors and ""disc fax"" machines of the 1980s, speech-writing, campaigning and reporting all lived and breathed the same fervid, sometimes foetid, air.

Election live: Rolling updates

The words ""battle bus"", then, are not just a straightforward term for a mode of transport; they describe an accelerated kind of politics, where candidates are always on-grid and where the media are part of the machine. Everywhere is now a battle bus.

And the repercussions were keenly felt by the people most associated with the golden age of the battle bus - Davids Owen and Steel of the the Liberal/SDP Alliance - not least because each had his own bus, replete with period personalised windscreens.

Image copyright David Levenson Image caption David Owen and David Steel with their respective battle buses

Double the liberal fun - except that the onboard journalists rapidly realised that they could play the leaders off against each other in transit, getting a statement from one and getting the other to ridicule it before realising where it had come from.

Perhaps that's why today's Lib Dems have switched their affection to another futuristic conveyance...

Hovercraft

Lib Dem leader Tim Farron campaigned in a hovercraft this week in Burnham-on-Sea, apparently undaunted by the experiences of Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe, who campaigned for the second of 1974's pair of elections using the same vehicle.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Tim Farron trying a different mode of transport on the campaign trail

Reasoning that voters could be found on beaches, Thorpe decided to surprise them by arriving from the sea in a campaign that ended only when colossal waves near Sidmouth nearly drowned the oilskinned candidate and left his hovercraft in pieces on the shingle.

At that time, there was one crucial difference about the word hovercraft. It tended to have a capital ""H"", as it was a proprietary term like Hoover or Portaloo.

The preferred generic phrase was ""air-cushion vehicle""; others used ""sea-saucer"" until the lower-case ""hovercraft"" took over.

Other terms you may not have realised are proprietary include Jacuzzi, Memory Stick, Quorn, Autocue and Rawlplug.

Draft manifesto

A draft simply means a drawing: a preliminary sketch, loose on the details, while manifesto is supposed to mean ""clear to the eye"" (as in, manifest). A draft manifesto in its very nature, then, is asking for trouble.

Labour's draft manifesto has been hastily converted to the real thing this week after a leak, which the Conservatives promptly described as ""a shambles"".

Shambles has never been a pleasant word: derived from a term for a bench, its original meaning is of that item of furniture as it is found at a butcher's: that is, a scene of quite literal carnage.

Image caption Malcolm Tucker: Originator of the term omnishambles

Worse still is an omnishambles, a term coined by writer Tony Roche for Malcolm Tucker to utter in The Thick of It which rapidly found itself being used by real-life politicians, an embrace which made the show's creator Armando Iannucci ""queasy and uneasy"".

Labour has tried to avoid being seen to play a subsequent blame game, a term popularised by Alcoholics Anonymous as a playing-out of recriminations that is best avoided.

In that spirit, Jeremy Corbyn has described himself as ""Monsieur Zen"".

Zen is the branch of Buddhism which holds that you should look not to scriptures (or perhaps to manifestos), but to a person's own heart.

There is no little irony here, given the charge that Labour's campaign is stressing the scripture over the man. Which brings us to...

Airbrushing

In a natty parallel, while Labour is accused of airbrushing Corbyn out of the party's campaign, the Conservatives have been described as airbrushing the word ""Conservatives"" in favour of images of their own leader.

Image copyright Getty Images

Airbrushing in politics used to be a much more literal business. For a despot to remove a rival from a photograph, all that was needed was a sharp scalpel.

But when it came to disguising your skulduggery, the airbrush was your friend, doing as its name suggests and spraying away to cover the evidence.

Nowadays, airbrush is used for metaphorical disappearance: if you've been removed from a picture, you're said to have been photoshopped (another proprietary term).

Digital tools for altering pictures are much more readily available than was the delicate airbrush, but that doesn't mean that anyone can use them - as Labour candidate Kate Hoey found this week when she tweeted a picture which was missing the head of rival candidate, Lib Dem George Turner - but not his legs.

Finally, for now...

The big six

In all the excitement over whether Theresa May's energy-cap proposal was a reheated version of an old Ed Miliband policy, word watchers were left wondering: why do we call those energy companies The Big Six?

The ""six"" part can be explained by counting them; allow Election Lexicon to explain the ""Big"".

The Big Six were originally the Big Four, and they weren't energy giants: they were the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St Louis Railway companies of the nineteenth-century US midwest.

It made for a snappier nickname than the merger's preferred CCC&StL anyway.","['image', 'election', 'buzzwords', 'term', 'battle', 'used', 'campaign', 'hovercraft', 'copyright', 'caption', 'significance', 'weeks', 'lexicon', 'word', 'week', 'lost']","Image copyright PA Image caption Monsieur Zen (self-proclaimed)Every general election throws up buzzwords and curiosities which help to define the tenor of the campaign.

Alcohol-related deaths 'rising',,,2008-01-25 10:37:55,"Men still drink more than women

Units explained

Office for National Statistics figures show there were 13.4 alcohol-related deaths per 100,000 population in 2006 - up from 12.9 in 2005.

The mortality rate in men (18.3/100,000) was more than twice the rate for females (8.8/100,000).

The overall death rate has almost doubled from 6.9 deaths per 100,000 people in 1991.

It appears that for certain younger people who've been drinking heavily for most of their lives, the consequences are beginning to show themselves at ever earlier stages

Frank Soodeen

Alcohol Concern

In total 8,758 deaths were linked to alcohol in 2006, compared to 4,144 deaths in 1991.

For men, the death rates in all age groups increased between 1991 and 2006.

The biggest increase was for men aged 35-54. Rates in this age group more than doubled over the period, from 13.4 to 31.1 deaths per 100,000.

However, the highest rates in each year were for men aged 55-74.

Similar pattern in women

Death rates by age group for females were consistently lower than rates for males.

However, the death rate for women aged 35­54 doubled between 1991 and 2006, from 7.2 to 14.8 per 100,000 population.

The government desperately needs to take a tougher approach with the alcohol and retail industry

Sarah Matthews

British Liver Trust

Again, the highest rates in each year were for the 55-74 age group.

Frank Soodeen, of the charity Alcohol Concern, said: ""The link between alcohol misuse and ill health is well established.

""However these figures reveal some disturbing trends. For the second year in a row, the biggest rise in deaths has been among men aged 35-54.

""It appears that for certain younger people who've been drinking heavily for most of their lives, the consequences are beginning to show themselves at ever earlier stages.

""It is vital that the government finally starts investing more in alcohol treatment to help problem drinkers address these issues before the situation becomes irretrievable.""

Dr Christopher Record, a liver disease consultant based in Newcastle, said: ""There is terrific pressure in society for people to drink. Those that don't drink are considered to be freaks and abnormal.

""But the main reason why, we are drinking more is alcohol is too cheap. Alcohol now is 50% less expensive that it was 25 years ago and, needless to say, consumption has gone up by 50% pro rata.""

Professor Ian Gilmore, President of the Royal College of Physicians, was particularly concerned by the rise in deaths among women.

""My colleagues and I are certainly seeing more women with serious liver damage than ever before in our clinics,"" he said.

Tougher line call

Sarah Matthews, of the British Liver Trust, said that a major part of the problem was that alcohol was cheap, readily available and glamorised by celebrities.

""The government desperately needs to take a tougher approach with the alcohol and retail industry, clamping down on cheap promotions and irresponsible advertising - particularly before the 9pm watershed.

""Clear and effective health warnings on alcohol like 'alcohol kills' would also help in raising awareness of the damage that alcohol can have.""

Public Health Minister Dawn Primarolo said the government was launching a £10m education campaign to raise awareness of alcohol, and reviewing alcohol pricing and promotion.

It had also toughened enforcement of underage sales by retailers, and planned more help for people who wanted to drink less.

She said: ""We know we're not going to change people's attitudes to alcohol overnight - it's going to take time, but it's reassuring to see that figures, published earlier this week, suggest alcohol consumption is no longer on the rise.""","['alcoholrelated', 'drink', 'alcohol', 'liver', 'rates', 'aged', 'deaths', 'rate', 'age', 'rise', 'rising', 'men']","Men still drink more than womenUnits explainedOffice for National Statistics figures show there were 13.4 alcohol-related deaths per 100,000 population in 2006 - up from 12.9 in 2005.

Quantified self: The tech-based route to a better life?,"Self-improvement has never been easier, thanks to apps and devices that measure all your everyday activities. But can you count your way to better health?",Karen Weintraub,2013-01-02 00:00:00,"Another New Year, another list of resolutions to make… and no doubt break. For some, 2013 may begin by going to the gym, or giving up smoking. But what about a more thorough and personal approach towards self-improvement, like monitoring your thoughts, e-mails, or even your bowel movements? If the answer is yes, then perhaps this is the year that you’ll be joining a growing group of people who are using technology to measure their lives in extraordinary detail.

Probably since the dawn of humanity, people have been fascinated by even the most minute details of their lives, and kept track of what was going on in their bodies and minds. The Roman philosopher Seneca tracked the food he ate and what he dreamt at night. Benjamin Franklin consistently recorded his performance on 13 measures, such as cleanliness, frugality and overindulgence, believing it would keep him virtuous. Engineer and architect Buckminster Fuller nicknamed himself “guinea pig b” and kept a diary on his daily life and ideas.

But in the past, record-keeping was time-consuming, requiring a commitment that only a very few had the patience to muster. Others cared, but not THAT much. Today, that’s changing, as it becomes easier to track everything, from diet to mood to sleep quality. Smartphones come equipped with features like GPS, accelerometers and gyroscopes that can record your activity, location and other vital statistics. Millions of fitness-focused or diet-conscious people track their workouts or their desserts with apps and devices like Fitbit that track physical activity or calories burned. New technology also makes it easier to share results with others – who doesn’t want to brag the first time they run more than 5 miles (8km), or be praised when they’ve managed to lose 10 pounds (5kg)?

A growing band of devotees centered in the United States, called the Quantified Self movement, has taken the effort to another level. Its members track a whole list of measures and push the technology available to keep tabs on their ideas, their mental health, even their microbiome – the colonies of bacteria that live on or inside their bodies. Some might scoff at their efforts to keep spreadsheets documenting their mood, diet or sleep patterns. “But the insights that we could learn from having all this quantified self data available are almost unfathomable,” says Amy Robinson, an organiser of Quantified Self Boston, a group that includes about 650 members and holds bimonthly meet-ups to share ideas and progress.

“Quantified self helps you keep a reference to how you lived not only the day before but two weeks before or a year before,” Robinson says. “You know when you achieve your best, you know when you exceed your best and it makes that possible by simply having the numbers there.”

Yet such lofty personal goals come down to something that couldn’t be more mundane: manually recording the number of daily bowel movements or every bite of food consumed.

Lawrence David spent a year tracking 300 measures about his health and behaviour – including the microbes in his digestive system – while he was a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. David created a self-tracking system by tinkering with an iPhone app designed to record and manage business cards. Every meal became a new “card” entry, with hundreds he had to type in by hand over the year – one night’s entry could be cheeseburger and fries, the next pepperoni pizza. “One of the few datasets out there is going to be full of junk food,” he says, confessing to a personal weakness.

He got to the point where he hated the process so much that he didn’t want to eat because then he’d have to record it. “It was terrible,” he admits. “Super tedious.” But when his boss, associate professor Eric Alm, got food poisoning while self-tracking, it was the first time the microbial pattern of human diarrhoea had been followed in real-time. Sounds gross, but understanding the progress of food poisoning in such a manner could be an important step toward developing treatments for it.

And other than confirming his love of junk food, he did learn some useful things about himself. David discovered that he wasted a lot of time on e-mail during the day, and wasn’t as productive as he thought he was late at night. Now, he saves most of his e-mailing for the evenings – instead of disrupting his research to respond – and doesn’t feel guilty when he takes a night off. He’s stopped tracking most of the other measures, though.

Number power

Like David, others who use technology to self-track rely on a mix of mind-numbing and automated measures, and they talk about the greater good, as well as what they’ve learned about themselves. The Quantified Self movement originated in San Francisco, after it was first proposed by Wired editors Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly in 2007. As of October 2012, the Quantified Self movement counted more than 70 meet-up groups worldwide with over 5,000 members – of course, they keep track of that sort of thing. (There’s actually a greater number of self-tracking apps on mobile phones than members – around 7,500 at the moment.) Many of these self-trackers are researchers, computer scientists, or simply tech-savvy, 21st-century Benjamin Franklins who think the act of collecting so much data has the power to transform themselves and the rest of society.

Meet-ups are part 7-minute show-and-tells, part social hour. At her first meet-up, in Alabama, Amy Robinson was the only one who had tried quantifying anything, while other attendees were just curious about the idea. In Boston, as you might expect from being an academic and tech hub, many of the participants have developed their own hacks and want to trade tips on how to maximise their record-keeping.

Robinson says she has long been fascinated with where ideas come from, so she started sending herself an e-mail whenever a good one popped into her head. Recently, she collected six months of these e-mails – 770 in all – analysed them, and presented the results at a Quantified Self meetup in Boston in October. Among the themes that came up most often were “science”, “beautiful” and “health.” She found that she had the most new ideas immediately after attending an inspiring conference, travelling or experiencing something new. Doing this exercise helped feed her fascination with the human mind, she told the group, as well as “discover more ways to think about myself and discover how my mind works relative to other people’s.”

Melanie Swan, founder of DIYgenomics, a California-based non-profit that promotes personalised medicine, has presented her findings at several Bay Area meet-ups, and she says meet-up attendees have changed as the movement has evolved. At first, the typical person was obsessive, “someone who is really rigorous about self-tracking either because of a health reason or they’re compelled to improve their mental performance or whatever,” she says. “But who’s now at the meet-ups is a much broader slice, though I would say it’s still a pretty tech-forward thinking kind of audience – anybody interested in improving an aspect of their health.”

Power of the nudge

While their interest in self-quantification is technological, another factor is a more general one: the growing obsession with self-improvement over the past few decades, says Natasha Schull, a cultural anthropologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Weight Watchers has been telling people since the 1970s that if they want to lose weight, they need to track what they eat. The field of behavioural economics, which studies the connection between thoughts and financial decisions, has found that if you alter peoples’ social environment, they might be nudged into conducting more rational behaviour. For instance, if school cafeterias display fruit before fried chicken, students are more likely to eat fruit because they grab the first food they see. And having people track their actions makes a difference, says Schull, encouraging more people to make the effort to track.

Self-tracking might not have been such a fringe activity in the past, either. There were plenty of people keeping diaries and self-accounts in the 1800s and 1900s, says Schull. “Even having a watch and being mindful of time is a form of self-regulation that went along with industrialisation,” she says.

As long as there have been people tracking themselves, there have been people mocking those trackers, Schull adds. D.H. Lawrence wrote a piece making fun of Franklin’s self-obsession and the cockiness embedded in his 13 virtues, including this description: “He was a little model, was Benjamin. Doctor Franklin. Snuff-coloured little man! Immortal soul and all!”

Behind such insults lies the idea that tracking the minutiae of one’s life can be pointless, an end in itself. Others worry that it could be used for self-destructive purposes, like an anorexic tracking how little she eats. “It seems to me in the contemporary US example, the means and the end are blurring,” says Schull, who co-taught a class at Harvard University in the autumn called “Self as Data”. “I think people are still motivated – at least they say they are – by some kind of transformation, but it’s seen as something that doesn’t really end.” Like the Alcoholics Anonymous model, where people who were once alcoholics are always recovering, Schull says. “It’s a different model of what health is.”

Weight and see

For Mark Gerstein, a professor of bioinformatics at Yale University, tracking his weight helped him keep it under control. “If you watch things, you tend to do better, by virtue of being aware of them,” says Gerstein, who has a wifi-enabled bathroom scale that automatically records his weight and feeds it into a database.

Gerstein has also been tracking his asthma symptoms in hope of being able to reduce his medication. He says he sees a little correlation between his exercise and his peak air flow, and thinks the more he can measure about himself, the more he’ll know about what triggers his wheezing and the better he’ll be at controlling it. It’s not just Gerstein’s data that’s important, this kind of information from thousands of people who have asthma could become much more powerful when it’s aggregated. “There’s a whole other level of what happens when all this information flows together and you can look for patterns and trends,” he says.

But not all self-quantification efforts are successful. Schull’s student, Sneha Khullar, began – reluctantly – tracking several measures as a class assignment. In her final presentation to the class in December, she explained that she enjoyed using a pedometer to track her footsteps and an app called RescueTime, which showed she is most productive on Fridays – now that she’s given up partying. But writing down everything she ate was too much of a drag, and piling up chocolate wrappers didn’t help her moderate her sweet tooth.

According to Khullar, a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, self-tracking needs to be easy enough to carry out routinely, but not so easy that it can be ignored. Having to convert miles into kilometres so she could figure out how much she had run required just enough effort to get her invested in the process, with an incentive to keep running more. “I could not have imagined I could run more than 5 miles,” she proudly told her classmates. But, these tools were way more successful in behaviour-enhancing than in controlling bad habits, she admitted.

And perhaps this barrier to participation is key to whether self-tracking will fully make the leap from tech obsessives to the mainstream public. “It’s a question of when does it become easy and when does it become useful,” says Stephen Wolfram, creator of the technical computing software Mathematica. He says he’s been self-tracking for a quarter of a century – everything from his personal health to his e-mail to the use patterns of every room in his house. But there are some things even he declines to measure. He doesn’t bother with skin conductivity measures, for instance, because he doesn’t like wearing the devices. He doesn’t wear a camera around his neck, “because it’s not socially realistic for the life I lead – maybe if I were much younger.” And he doesn’t record his side of phone conversations because speech recognition software still isn’t good enough to provide an accurate transcript. Why would he want a transcript of every conversation? “Am I repeating myself? You can immediately check,” he says.

Privacy matters

The next crucial step for self-tracking, several people said, will be the ability to integrate different data streams. Right now, the wifi-enabled scale doesn’t talk to the program that monitors blood pressure, diet or sleep – but such integration will come eventually. Maybe someday it will even link up with “smart” toilets that can read shifting microbial populations and warn of impending illness. The key will be finding ways to make the data meaningful, rather than just overwhelming. And to keep it private.

Yale’s Gerstein says he worries a lot about the privacy aspects of all thins data. Right now, it seems harmless to share information about our sleep patterns, genes and microbial populations. But one day, that information could be more meaningful – and could be used against us. Sleep patterns could be relevant, say, in a court case about a traffic accident. People who post genetic information now are revealing things about their future children and grandchildren. “I think the fear is people will pile up a lot of information about themselves and share it without fully seeing the implications,” Gerstein says.

Robinson says there’s no question the Quantified Self movement she is part of will have to address privacy issues. “Let the people who want to share their data in a way that maintains their privacy, but also helps other people,” she says.

And doctors are going to need to learn how to deal with all the data their patients are beginning to bring them. Right now, Robinson says, people in the Quantified Self movement “want to share their information with their doctor, but their doctor doesn’t really know what to do with it.”

Wolfram, the founder and CEO of Wolfram Research and founder of the technology company Wolfram|Alpha, thinks the data will eventually redefine what doctors do. A doctor would be hard-pressed to make sense of the data once people are wired to track their heart rate, blood sugar levels, blood pressure and dozens of other measures. But computers will be able to easily spot patterns and trends, diagnosing far more accurately than doctors can today, and far earlier in the disease process, says Wolfram, who is developing analytics to meet this need.

"El secreto del éxito de Alcohólicos Anónimos para recuperar adictos ""en 12 pasos""","Se cumplen 80 años de la fundación de Alcohólicos Anónimos, que propuso un modelo de tratamiento de las adicciones luego copiado muchas veces en todo el mundo. Pero el programa es también objeto de críticas sostenidas.",,2015-06-15 00:00:00,"Derechos de autor de la imagen HBO Image caption Una reunión de AA en la serie Los Soprano de HBO.

Se cumplen 80 años desde la fundación Alcohólicos Anónimos y, desde entonces, se han creado miles de grupos que copian su método para tratar distintas formas de adicción. Chris Stokel-Walker explora cuál es el secreto del éxito del ""sólo por hoy"".

""Mi nombre es Pedro y soy un alcohólico"".

Es una frase que suena familiar incluso para aquellos que nunca han asistido a una reunión de Alcohólicos Anónimos (AA).

Pedro se presenta así ante los otros 40 concurrentes a la reunión, que tiene lugar una mañana de domingo en una pequeña sala cerca de la principal calle comercial de Newcastle, en el norte de Inglaterra.

La respuesta es una bienvenida al unísono, cálida y entusiasta: ""Hola, Pedro"".

Quienes están aquí tienen algo en común: su dependencia del alcohol. Aunque vienen de diferentes sectores de la sociedad y tienen distintas ocupaciones e historias de vida.

Derechos de autor de la imagen AP Image caption AA se creó hace 80 años.

El formato de la reunión es simple: una presentación, una lectura, el testimonio de un miembro, luego una discusión abierta en la que cualquiera de los presentes puede compartir sus preocupaciones, sus logros o sus pensamientos.

Pedro empezó a tomar a los 11 años. ""Para cuando tuve la edad en que se puede empezar a beber legalmente, yo ya era un visitante habitual de los centros de tratamiento de alcoholismo, iba una y otra vez al médico, una y otra vez me llevaban arrestado a la estación de policía"".

Ahora, Pedro lleva 34 años sin probar el alcohol y atribuye su sobriedad sostenida a su participación en AA.

Los 12 pasos

Todos los miembros mencionan el ""proceso de transitar por los 12 pasos"" como uno de los pilares del programa de AA.

El primero de esos pasos, publicado cuatro años después de la fundación de la entidad, dice: ""Admitimos que éramos impotentes ante el alcohol, que nuestras vidas se habían vuelto ingobernables"".

Derechos de autor de la imagen Narcotics Anonymous Image caption El programa de recuperación de los 12 pasos de Narcóticos Anónimos es el mismo que el de AA.

Los 12 pasos son, en pocas palabras, un plan de recuperación para lograr superar la adicción.

Ese plan incluye la sumisión ante un poder espiritual superior, el reconocimiento del alcoholismo como un problema que no tiene final, la reparación de los daños causados a las personas afectadas por la adicción y un despertar espiritual a través de la oración o la meditación. (Vea la descripción detallada de cada uno de los pasos al final de este artículo).

Fundado por Bill Wilson y Bob Smith en Akron, en el estado de Ohio, AA se desprendió de una organización cristiana estadounidense, llamada The Grupo Oxford.

El grupo celebra este año el 80º aniversario del momento en que Wilson ayudó a Smith a salir del alcoholismo: el 10 de junio de 1935 fue la fecha de su último trago.

Ese elemento social de AA, la importancia del ""sponsor"" o padrino del adicto, es tan conocido como sus 12 pasos.

A la fecha, hay 115.326 grupos afiliados a AA en 175 países, según las más recientes estimaciones de la entidad. Sólo en Estados Unidos hay 60.143.

De acuerdo a un estudio de 1998, 90% de los centros de tratamiento de adicciones privados se basa en el modelo estadounidense de los 12 pasos.

A cada adicción, su grupo

Y los principios han sentado las bases para otros grupos que no tienen vínculos directos con AA.

Entre ellos, Narcóticos Anónimos, el más específico Marihuana Anónimos, Jugadores Anónimos, incluso grupos para adictos al trabajo o el sexo.

Además de los más conocidos para tratar la adicción a la comida, hay otros para quienes sufren el trastorno de acumulación o para quienes tienen una inhabilidad patológica ""para cubrir sus propias necesidades materiales"". Y para los parientes preocupados por quienes sufren adicciones de toda clase, bajo el rótulo Familias Anónimas.

Derechos de autor de la imagen House of Cards Netflix Image caption Una reunión de AA en la serie de Netflix, House of Cards.

En algunos pueblos pequeños donde no hay grupos dedicados a un trastorno específico se alienta a los pacientes a que concurran a otra reunión de adictos, así sea de otra clase: que los adictos al juego busquen apoyo en una sesión de alcohólicos, por ejemplo.

""Si uno mira el programa de los 12 pasos, la única diferencia realmente se da en la primera parte del primer paso. El resto del programa es un proyecto para la vida"", dice Pedro.

""Los 12 pasos (de AA) son muy aplicables a cualquier otra adicción"", confirma Amy Krentzman, de la Escuela de Trabajo Social de la Universidad de Minnesota, que ha hecho investigación sobre AA y otros programas basados.

""Modifican el lenguaje, pero la lógica es la misma… y tienen el respaldo de otra gente que ya ha transitado esos 12 pasos y ha alcanzado el éxito, lo cual es alentador"".

La mayoría de los grupos ofrecen sesiones por Skype, donde la disponibilidad es de 24 horas. ""Ahí hay compañeros siempre dispuestos a escuchar y uno dice lo de siempre, 'Mi nombre es tal y soy adicto a tal cosa'"", apunta el coordinador.

La teoría del ayudante

Parte del éxito de estas instituciones se apoya también en la llamada teoría del ayudante, acuñada en los años 60.

Según Krentzman, contar con una persona destinada a asistir al adicto de manera directa suele ser beneficioso para ambos: da al padrino una sensación de bienestar, que ayuda en su propio proceso dado que muchos de ellos son también adictos en recuperación.

Muchas películas y series de TV, de ""The Sopranos"" a ""Mad Men"", ""House of Cards"" o ""The West Wing"", retratan la relación entre el adicto y su sponsor. Muchas veces, los primeros reciben apoyo emocional y espiritual, además de la guía práctica, de parte de sus padrinos.

El otro principio es que AA considera el tratamiento como un proceso continuo, que nunca termina. Y que se aborda de un día a la vez: la meta es ir pasando las tentaciones de a 24 horas, ponerse por meta el día siguiente.

Derechos de autor de la imagen Getty Image caption AA considera el tratamiento como un proceso continuo, que nunca termina.

Esto lo diferencia de otros abordajes a la adicción que ofrecen programas cortos y luego dejan al adicto hacer frente a su vida cotidiana sin mayor acompañamiento.

Marihuana Anónimos tiene ""exactamente el mismo formato"", dice Thomas, un miembro del grupo. ""Tiene los 12 pasos y varias historias que demuestran la aplicación práctica de esos pasos, de gente que ha pasado por la experiencia y se ha mantenido sobrio desde entonces"".

No es para todos

Pero estos grupos que siguen la propuesta de AA no cuentan con el apoyo de la organización central, que se maneja a través de Alcoholics Anonymous World Services (AAWS), dueña de los derechos de autor.

AAWS sí otorga permiso para el uso de los 12 pasos.

Y los principios tienen sus detractores, claro está. Muchos critican el elemento cuasi religioso, otros el énfasis en la abstinencia absoluta más que la opción de un consumo moderado y controlado.

Lea: ¿Qué es peor: un par de copas diarias o una gran borrachera los fines de semana?

Un filme, titulado ""The 13th Step"", denunció supuestos casos de abuso sexual cometidos por integrantes de AA que tuvieron por víctimas a adictos asistentes a las reuniones.

Pero tal vez la mayor crítica proviene de quienes quieren evidencia concreta de que este programa ampliamente aceptado alcanza resultados reales.

""La evidencia muestra que funciona muy bien para algunas personas"", dice Krentzman.

Una revisión de todos los estudios científicos que se han hecho sobre la tasa de éxito de AA, publicada en 2006, encontró que ""ningún estudio experimental demostró de manera unívoca la eficacia de AA"".

Lance Dodes, un especialista en abuso de sustancias, escribió en un libro sobre los 12 pasos: ""Alcohólicos Anónimos fue proclamado el tratamiento correcto contra el alcoholismo hace 75 años, pese a la falta de evidencia científica sobre la eficacia de su método y desde entonces hemos seguido sosteniéndolo como válido"".

¿Toda adicción es enfermedad?

Otro foco contencioso es que el traslado del programa de 12 pasos a otras áreas da legitimidad social a la idea de que una amplia gama de compulsiones representan enfermedades.

Derechos de autor de la imagen Getty Image caption El programa de AA se ha usado desde hace 80 años, pero no hay evidencia científica de su efectividad.

Los científicos continúan divididos sobre si la adicción a la comida realmente existe. Discuten si la adicción al sexo es real o no – de hecho, no aparece mencionada en la lista de desórdenes y trastornos mentales de la Asociación Estadounidense de Psiquiatría.

Pero, para muchos, el programa es efectivo. ""Funciona por un proceso psicológico, uno espiritual y uno social"", detalla Krentzman. ""Por la manera en que da un sentido de comunidad a la gente, por el hecho de saber que otros sufren lo mismo que tú"".

Esto es algo en lo que coincide Jennifer, que asiste a Overeaters Anonymous, para el tratamiento del sobrepeso.

Se unió al grupo en 2008, cuando tenía 37 años y pesaba casi 114 kilos. Hoy, con varios kilos menos, atribuye parte del éxito a su relación sostenida con otros compañeros del grupo.

""Las veces que he ido a terapia siempre tenía la sensación de que me daban consejos para probar pero no tenían experiencia de primera mano. Hay algo auténtico en esto de tener a un adicto ayudando a otro adicto"".

""Es un programa muy simple para gente con complicaciones. Que resiste críticas de adentro y de afuera (de la organización), lo que no se puede decir de muchas otras filosofías de rehabilitación de adicciones"", agrega Thomas.

Derechos de autor de la imagen Thinkstock Image caption No hay consenso sobre si la adicción a la comida es una enfermedad.

En la reunión de domingo en Newcastle, los 40 asistentes se sientan, escuchan y cuentan historias de adicción. Hay apretones de mano y conversaciones amigables, compasión, sonrisas y bromas compartidas.

Uno a uno van saliendo cuando termina la cita: salen a la calle, se mezclan con los muchos transeúntes y sus bolsas de compras y se ven como uno más en la multitud. Pero en sus mentes llevan un peso extra: el del compromiso en 12 pasos, que los acompañará hasta que toque renovarlo la próxima semana. Una semana a la vez.

En esta nota se reserva el apellido de quienes dieron su testimonio a la BBC para resguardar su privacidad.

Los 12 pasos de AA

Admitimos que éramos impotentes ante el alcohol y que nuestras vidas se habían vuelto ingobernables. Llegamos a creer que un Poder superior a nosotros podría devolvernos el sano juicio. Resolvimos confiar nuestra voluntad y nuestra vida al cuidado de Dios, según nuestro propio entendimiento de Él. Sin temor, hicimos un sincero y minucioso examen de conciencia. Admitimos ante Dios, ante nosotros mismos y ante otro ser humano la naturaleza exacta de nuestras faltas. Estuvimos enteramente dispuestos a que Dios eliminase todos estos defectos de carácter. Pedimos a Dios humildemente que nos librase de nuestras culpas. Hicimos una lista de todas las personas a quienes habíamos perjudicado, y estuvimos dispuestos a reparar el mal que les ocasionamos. Reparamos directamente el mal causado a esas personas cuando nos fue posible, excepto en los casos en que el hacerlo les hubiese infligido más daño o perjudicado a un tercero. Proseguimos con nuestro examen de conciencia, admitiendo espontáneamente nuestras faltas al momento de reconocerlas. Mediante la oración y la meditación, tratamos de mejorar nuestro contacto consciente con Dios y le pedimos tan sólo la capacidad para reconocer su voluntad y las fuerzas para cumplirla. Habiendo logrado un despertar espiritual como resultado de estos pasos, tratamos de llevar este mensaje a otras personas y practicar estos principios en todas nuestras acciones.

Ruby Wax is 'Losing it' at the Edinburgh Fringe,Comedian Ruby Wax's Edinburgh Fringe show looks for laughs in the story of her mental illness.,,None,"Image caption Ruby Wax has been touring the show around psychiatric hospitals

Ruby Wax is mentally ill.

""But at least I got a show out of it,"" she tells the audience with her trademark glibness.

Losing it, playing at the Underbelly during the Edinburgh Fringe, is Wax's examination of her own breakdown and her thoughts on what led her to it.

The 58-year-old maintains the hyperactive, self-centred, wisecracking persona which she developed over three decades in the spotlight but there is also a more honest and vulnerable Wax telling a personal story.

Wax shares the details of her own clinical depression and her trips to the Priory and confronts the stigma and shame of mental illness.

""The show is comedy,"" she says.

""It is hilarious. I don't talk about raising awareness but at one point I see the audience start nodding their heads and they are saying 'I got that too'.

""But you don't have to be mentally ill to get what I'm talking about.""

""I have always been interested in psychology,"" Wax says.

She studied the subject at the University of California at Berkeley before running away to Glasgow to study acting.

""Acting became a job and I always said 'at some time I am going to go back and study this'.""

It is like finding out you are not possessed by the devil Ruby Wax

She is currently studying for a Masters degree in ""mindfulness-based cognitive therapy"" at Oxford.

Wax says that understanding the way the brain functions takes the fear away.

""It is like finding out you are not possessed by the devil,"" she says.

During the show, she delivers a cod-lecture on the science of the brain.

Careful not to be too serious, she steers away from neuroscience but her message is clear.

""Mental illness is a disease like diabetes, it cannot just be wished away.""

Wax has been performing the show, alongside her friend Judith Owen, for more than a year in hospitals and psychiatric units.

She says performing in psychiatric hospitals is the ""biggest thrill"" but she wants to reach out to the ""lost tribe"" of sufferers and carers.

'Got it made'

""My people,"" as she calls them.

Wax and Owen, who plays piano and sings snatches of songs which try to encapsulate the feelings the comedian is describing, will take the show to London's West End after its Edinburgh run.

Wherever they go they hold forums which discuss mental health issues such as the effectiveness of drugs and also seek to put people in touch with help and support.

Later in the year, Wax will unveil a website called blackdogtribe.com.

Wax says the website will have chat rooms and it will be very visual because much of the mental health literature can be very hard to read.

She hopes it will create a mental health brand which is something like Alcoholic Anonymous, where people form a network of support for each other.

""Those alcoholics have got it made,"" she quips.

On the trail of George Orwell’s outcasts,"Retracing Orwell's footsteps, Emma Jane Kirby finds the hallmarks of poverty he identified - addiction, exhaustion and, often, a quiet dignity - are as apparent now as they were 80 years ago.",,None,"Image copyright Other Image caption Orwell's narration begins in the street he called the Rue du Coq d'Or, in the 5th Arrondissement, where he once lived

Some 80 years after George Orwell chronicled the lives of the hard-up and destitute in his book Down and Out in Paris and London, what has changed? Retracing the writer's footsteps, Emma Jane Kirby finds the hallmarks of poverty identified by Orwell - addiction, exhaustion and, often, a quiet dignity - are as apparent now as they were then.

""Quarrels, and the desolate cries of street hawkers, and the shouts of children chasing-orange-peel over the cobbles, and at night loud singing and the sour reek of the refuse carts, made up the atmosphere of the street…. Poverty is what I'm writing about and I had my first contact with poverty in this slum.""

Image copyright bbc 'Tomber dans la misere' (falling into misery), is the phrase she whispers most and I notice her breath is sour like someone who diets or skips meals Emma Jane Kirby

Such was George Orwell's recollection of what he called the Rue du Coq d'Or in Paris, 1929 - the real-life Rue du Pot de Fer. Today it's pleasure rather than poverty that defines the Latin Quarter that Orwell frequented 80-odd years ago. The chic pavement cafes are full of contented-looking people leisurely sipping their vin rose, and the air is perfumed by the sweet smell of crepes and tourists' money.

But poverty hasn't left Paris - she's simply changed address. She may not look quite the same as she did in the 1920s but if Orwell were to meet her again on these streets, he'd know her straight away. And I doubt he'd find her greatly changed...

Poverty came knocking on Claudine's door five years ago when she was made redundant. She leans in close to me as she talks, her right hand often rising to her mouth as if it wants to censor the words that her lips keep forming. ""Tomber dans la misere"" (falling into misery), is the phrase she whispers most and I notice her breath is sour like someone who diets or skips meals.

""We don't eat lunch,"" she tells me. ""It's just my little way of economising."" She nods down to her bulging shopping caddy. ""It's enough for my family's dinner,"" she says, ""but not enough for two meals a day.""

Shame

Claudine and I are sitting in a big warehouse in the north of Paris, which serves as a food distribution centre for the city's chronically poor. It reminds me of the sort of indoor market you find in the less salubrious quarters of former Soviet states - mountains of unbranded pasta and rice piled on tables, misshapen, anaemic-looking vegetables wilting in crates, biscuits and chocolate wrapped in such bland, stark white paper, that not even a child could be excited by its contents.

We watch the steady line of people, Europeans, Maghrebians and West Africans, methodically trudging from table to table, collecting their rations and stuffing them quickly into a pram hood or caddy. Despite the animated cheerfulness of the staff, I notice not one of the customers meets their eye as they take the food parcels.

Shame, Claudine - who is French - tells me, is what links everyone here. She's told no-one that her weekly shop is a hand-out and she doubts anyone else here has admitted it either.

The secrecy that's attached to poverty is one of the first things that struck Orwell.

""From the start,"" he wrote, ""it tangles you in a net of lies and even with the lies you can hardly manage it.""

Orwell the down and out Image copyright Getty Images Orwell was born Eric Arthur Blair on 25 June 1903 in eastern India, the son of a British colonial civil servant. He was educated in England and, after he left Eton, joined the Indian Imperial Police in Burma, then a British colony. He resigned in 1927 and decided to become a writer. In 1928, he moved to Paris where lack of success as a writer forced him into a series of menial jobs. He described his experiences in his first book, Down and Out in Paris and London, published in 1933. In Paris, he washed dishes at the overpriced ""Hotel X"", in a filthy, hot kitchen. He met ""eccentric people - people who have fallen into solitary, half-mad grooves of life and given up trying to be normal or decent"".

Milly is fighting poverty with a fierce, indignant energy. A bilingual secretary from Cameroon, she is immaculately dressed and has the practised deportment of a society debutante.

In the drop-in centre where I meet her, she looks decidedly out of place next to the dusty, weary figures that are slumped beside her. Appearances, she tells me, are everything if one is to cling on to one's dignity. She agrees to talk to me but only in a private room so that the other people here won't realise that her situation is as bad as theirs. When the door closes she tells me that she's homeless and last night she slept on a veranda.

Milly is facing deportation. She came here legally but after she fell ill and had to stop working, her carte de sejour - the papers that allow her to stay and work in France - were revoked. She admits that she is homesick but is terrified to return to Cameroon empty-handed. I ask her if her family know she's homeless and she throws her hands up in the air and rolls her eyes in horror.

""It would kill them,"" she tells me. ""They would drop down dead with shame.""

Aching all over

When I meet Modi from Mali, he looks as if he might drop down dead with fatigue. Like Orwell, Modi is a plongeur, a washer-upper in a big restaurant and he works six days a week, 12 hours a day cleaning pots and pans.

When we talk in the bar of a neighbouring restaurant, his head keeps drooping onto his folded arms and it seems to be such an effort for him to articulate his words that he either slurs them all together in a gluey, glottal jumble, or shoots out small phrases in tiny bursts of energy that fizzle out before the last word has been formed.

Orwell complained that when working as a plongeur he felt as if his back were broken and his head ""filled with hot cinders"". Modi agrees that he aches all over and at the end of the day he cannot feel his feet.

Because rent in Paris is too expensive, he lives an hour's train ride outside the city. Although after midnight the trains are slower so it takes two hours for Modi to get home. He gets up at 0700 and gets to bed at 0200. Most plongeurs in Paris these days are either Pakistani or West African. I stop asking myself why that is, when Modi tells me how much he is paid - just under 4 euros (£3.50) an hour. He's working, of course, ""on the black"".

""The last time I had a night out,"" he says flicking through a virtual diary in his brain, ""was... last year.""

Madame Jolivet can have as many nights out with friends as she wants to - her problem is she's not allowed to have any nights in with them.

Image copyright Other Image caption Madame Jolivet's tiny B&B room costs 1,730 euros a month

The rules of her B&B state clearly that visitors are not permitted, but I have managed to frighten the landlady into admitting me by pretending to be an official from the local authority. Now I'm standing (albeit slightly stooped) in her fusty-smelling attic apartment.

I am Madame Jolivet's first visitor in six years and she is laughing hysterically at having won this tiny victory over her hated landlady. I tell her that in Orwell's day, the residents in his filthy hotel used to yell ""Vache! Salope!"" (""Cow! Bitch!"") at their landlady, and Madame Jolivet doubles up with mirth as she mimes the insults at the sky-light. Then, quite suddenly, she looks sick with fear and switches the TV on at a high volume, motioning to the door and telling me the landlady is probably listening at it. She's right. We hear her tread softly back down the stairs.

Orwell's hotel room was infested with bugs - Madame Jolivet's is infested with mice. She's tormented by their scratching at night. She's caught them on camera during the day, and once she found one in her fridge. She complained to the landlady who warned her that if she mentions it again, she'll kick her out - after all, she's already been warned that her daughter's voice is too loud.

Madame Jolivet is a large lady and she squeezes herself round the tiny space of her apartment. When she's at the sink she's jammed between the bed and the table, her body painfully curved sideways to avoid smacking her head on the sloped ceiling. The landlady charges 1,730 euros (£1,500) a month for this space which she rents out as a 16 sq m apartment. Recently the police did a spot check on Madame Jolivet's apartment and recorded the actual habitable surface area as just 5 sq m - that's the size of about six or seven beach towels.

Madame Jolivet lives here with her grown-up son and daughter. Until last year her other daughter lived with them, too, but she tried to kill herself twice and is now in psychiatric care.

Although it's miles from the hostel where she's staying tonight, Milly, the dignified lady from Cameroon offers to come with me in the taxi to the Gare du Nord where I'm catching my train home to London to make my next step of Orwell's journey.

""In my country,"" she smiles, ""we never let a traveller start a journey alone.""

She's very jolly in the cab, reminiscing about her family, her sister in London, the present she sent her nephew in America last year. By the time we get to the Eurostar terminal I've completely forgotten that Milly's homeless and I realise with a real physical shock that this is exactly what she wanted, that she wanted me to see her as she was before poverty possessed her - a very proper, very animated, valuable woman.

She waves me off, her whole body swaying into the gesture, in that exaggerated way that small children say goodbye. Each time I turn, she's still there, both arms in the air, her head following the rhythm.

Sitting in my seat on the train, my eyes closed, I can see her still. The last line from a Stevie Smith poem comes into my head:

Not Waving but Drowning...

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Orwell closely studied the tramps of London

""There exists in our minds,"" wrote Orwell, ""a sort of ideal or typical tramp - a repulsive, rather dangerous creature, who would die rather than work or wash, and wants nothing but to beg, drink and rob hen-houses... I am not saying, of course, that most tramps are ideal characters; I am only saying that they are ordinary human beings, and that if they are worse than other people it is the result and not the cause of their way of life.""

Five minutes inside the soup-kitchen in Hackney, east London, and I immediately understand what Orwell meant - that the ""typical tramp"" does not exist.

The ""service-users"" - as the volunteers here call them - are a truly disparate group - some look as if they've just stepped off the tube after a busy day at work, others are unkempt and smell feral. Some are evidently fighting a losing battle with drugs and alcohol, while others look more in keeping with an old folks' home.

A well-spoken woman who is far more elegantly dressed than I am, and whom I take to be a doctor, confides in me her concerns about the well-being of a schizophrenic service-user she recently escorted to hospital. She then confounds me by sitting down to eat the free meal. A man with a carefully oiled black quiff is introduced to me by a grinning volunteer as Shakin' Stevens. I smile conspiratorially with him at Shaky's delusions and am later told by the service manager that the volunteer, himself, is delusional and has been coming here to eat each week for years.

Image copyright bbc Image caption Today's 'down and outs' are known as 'service-users'

Misfits

What was it that Orwell said? ""Change places and handy dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief?""

I am instantly struck by the civility of the meal time. A tattooed and very inebriated punk knocks over an elderly lady's walking frame as he staggers to find a free seat. He apologises, asks if the seat beside her is taken and then appears to engage her in polite conversation. When he is served a plate of Mediterranean vegetable pasta by the charming French chef, he thanks her profusely and leaning towards the Polish man opposite him asks if he would kindly pass the salt?

As I pour tea and coffee, an emaciated black man in a filthy sweatshirt shakes my hand warmly and asks me how I'm doing today? Society's misfits, fitting in.

So that's what you think is it? I'm just yet another homeless drunk? Grant

It's here I meet Stuart, who is currently on a methadone programme and who has serious mental health problems. Physically abused by his father, Stuart was put into care in the North East of England, where he claims he was then systematically sexually abused until he gathered the courage to run away to London at the age of 15.

Aside from a brief respite of a year or two when he had a council flat, the London streets have been the only home he's known. He is now 40. I ask him to tell me what he remembers about those early years sleeping rough.

He doesn't miss a beat before replying, ""Crack, heroin, begging, robbing, stealing and mugging"". An entire life, reduced into just six words.

Grant on the other hand can talk the hind legs off a donkey but he prefers to steer clear of personal details, claiming there are many people worse off than him.

He zooms through his life story with a dismissive wave of his hand - adopted, never held down a relationship, used to work in social care, lost his job, lives in a hostel, spent a long time in hospital after being brutally attacked on the street.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Orwell did the rounds of the night shelters and soup kitchens of London

He leaves out the part about his fairly evident problems with alcohol and when, three weeks into our acquaintance, I ask him about that side of his life he snarls defensively, ""So that's what you think is it? I'm just yet another homeless drunk?""

Grant is articulate and funny. He's wary and prickly, yet sensitive and compassionate.

He likes Orwell but prefers Jack London. When my questions become woolly, he pulls me up for being unfocused and he is constantly re-assessing and re-evaluating his own beliefs and opinions. Twice after our meetings he has sent me text messages, apologising for sounding grumpy. When we talk late in the evening, he suddenly checks his watch and becomes concerned about how I'm going to get home to the other side of London. When I ask what keeps him going in life, he gestures towards the volunteers who are clearing up the kitchen.

""Belief in your fellow man's goodness,"" he says. ""Because by and large people are good, aren't they?""

Recession

Orwell always defended tramps' reputation as ""drunks"", pointing out that none of the tramps he knew had any money with which to buy beer. But today alcohol is cheap and features heavily in the lives of many of those on the streets. Not least in the lives of the many Poles who came to seek their fortunes as labourers in the UK when the borders opened in 2004.

When the recession bit and the building sites closed, they had limited access to benefits and quickly found themselves homeless. The volunteers in many of the drop-in centres and soup kitchens I visit in London tell me that around a good third or even half of their service-users are now Polish. As one careworker put it, they're ""Orwell's latter-day Irish tramp"" - Catholic, slightly on the fringe of the London homeless community, and plagued with a ""great thirst"".

London Image copyright Getty Images In London, the narrator lives as a tramp, stopping off in a variety of accommodation - lodging houses, tramps' hostels and Salvation Army shelters. He meets a number of characters, including Bozo, a pavement artist, storyteller and philosopher, who is adept in the technique of begging. One chapter is devoted to the fine points of London guttersnipe slang.

Zibbi, who's in his early 40s came to the UK seven years ago, where he got work in a salad factory in Peterborough. For nine months life was ""good-good"", he tells me in his broken English.

""Good-good, because Zibbi is good and Zibbi no drink.""

Zibbi refers to himself almost entirely in the third person, as if while talking to me, he has stepped outside of himself and has become a detached observer, albeit with an anthropological curiosity in his own behaviour.

""Do Zibbi drink today?"" he asks me.

By the look - and smell of Zibbi - he does little else but drink these days. His face has bloated and taken on the colour of ripe plums, his hands shake and the sharp stench of pure alcohol from his breath overpowers even the acrid, vinegary smell of his clothes and the odour of hot grease from his recent fried breakfast, which still hangs in fat little globules in his beard and moustache.

He shakes his head. ""Oh, lady,"" he says, ""Zibbi drink not a little drink, Zibbi drink and drink. He drink vodka til…"" (he makes a gesture of passing out). ""Until bang and bye bye. Game over.""

Zibbi blames the heavy drinking culture of his country for his weakness and claims his cousin, Miro, is the worst influence on him, egging him on to have just one more. Frequently he seems to set himself on stage, theatrically acting out imagined dialogue he has with Miro and with his disgusted family. It's like watching a medieval morality play, with the forces of Good and Evil battling for power.

I've thought about [my situation] so many times on the streets - especially when I'm alone, but no-one really asked me before... I feel strengthless and hopeless Mikael

The drop-in centre has set Zibbi up with an alcohol adviser who is trying to help him cut down his alcohol consumption. He talks about her in hallowed terms, and when he whispers her name ""Karen"", he lifts his hands and face to heaven. I suspect she's the only woman he has regular contact with. When I meet Karen later she tells me that she's trying to wean Zibbi off calling her ""Mummy"".

I ask Zibbi what he thinks of himself and he looks startled. ""Me? Zibbi?"" he asks uncertainly and his eyes become confused as if he's struggling to connect the alcoholic Zibbi character with the man who speaks his words.

""I… I… I don't know,"" he stutters. He hangs his head and slumps in his chair.

""So tired lady. I… I…""

'Not needed'

Zibbi becomes distressed as he fruitlessly searches for words which might join his isolated personal pronoun and we stop the interview. I realise he has totally lost his sense of self.

A few miles east in Hackney, and Mikael, a young, good-looking Pole in his late 20s, has also lost his identity - or at least his identity papers. Someone stole them one night a few months back when he'd blacked out in a vodka-induced stupor. Mikael is so softly spoken that he's barely audible at times. He tells me that talking to me is like going to Confession.

""I've thought about it [my situation] so many times on the streets,"" he says. ""Especially when I'm alone, but no-one really asked me before... I feel strengthless and hopeless.""

Mikael underestimates himself. A bright man and a fluent English speaker, he's enrolled in an Alcoholics Anonymous programme and, in a bid to stay on track, has made the very difficult decision to eschew the company of his fellow Poles and all other rough sleepers. He is still on the streets but unlike Zibbi, he is wearing freshly laundered clothes and looks fit and fairly healthy. He may not smell of alcohol but he reeks of loneliness.

Seven years ago, life was very different for Mikael. He had a legal, well-paid job as a labourer, he had a fiancee, a studio-flat and a gym membership. There were holidays, cinema trips, football matches - there was, as Mikael puts, it a time when he was ""really connected to society… and there was a future"". Then his boss sold his business and moved overseas. Mikael began drinking heavily, lost his studio and his girlfriend. I ask him what he misses most about his old life, fully expecting him to say the obvious things - a hot shower, a comfortable bed, his own food. But Mikael says something quite different.

""I feel like I'm not needed by this world. Like nobody needs me,"" he says quietly. ""I miss my girlfriend because I felt then someone needed me. And I felt needed in terms of work.""

The evil of poverty, wrote Orwell, is not so much that it makes a man suffer as that it rots him physically and spiritually. Work, he insisted, is the only thing to turn a half-alive vagrant into a self-respecting human being.

Mikael is desperate to find a job believing that work is the yellow brick road which will lead him ""to come back to the normal life,"" as he puts it. Although he admits that it's hard to keep motivated when you wake up cold, wet and shattered from a disturbed night in a shop doorway.

Mikael's progress is sporadic. He has long spells when he's free of alcohol and then sudden lapses which infuriate him and provoke tirades of self hatred, especially when he imagines what his family back home in Poland would say if they knew he was on the streets.

I return to the soup kitchen three weeks later confident of meeting Mikael again but worryingly, he doesn't turn up. I think of the boyish shyness which passed across his face when he had told me that sometimes when he was very lonely he talked to God. The prayer he recited was always the same:

""Hello God - I hope you still remember me and keep some faith in me.""

At the end of Down and Out in Paris and London, George Orwell asks himself what he's learnt from his experiences on the streets and in deference to the great man I shall ask myself the same question. I have learnt how quickly the dry rot of poverty stultifies and festers, crumbling confidence and destroying dignity.

I have seen how poverty marginalises, separates and ridicules. And I have understood that the chief cruelty of homelessness is that it doesn't dull the sensibilities of the man sleeping in the doorway but rather spitefully heightens them, forcing upon him so many cavernous hours in which he can burn with shame, ache with loneliness and cry for his mother.

Perhaps Mikael sums it up for everyone I have met both in Paris and London when he says, ""You know it's so easy to lose everything. But it's so, so tough to get it back.""","['zibbi', 'shes', 'london', 'tells', 'mikael', 'trail', 'life', 'orwell', 'im', 'george', 'outcasts', 'poverty', 'paris', 'orwells']","Poverty is what I'm writing about and I had my first contact with poverty in this slum.""
But poverty hasn't left Paris - she's simply changed address.
He described his experiences in his first book, Down and Out in Paris and London, published in 1933.
When the door closes she tells me that she's homeless and last night she slept on a veranda.
I tell her that in Orwell's day, the residents in his filthy hotel used to yell ""Vache!",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-14372195
Alcohol disease 'hits young hard',,,2007-11-13 13:00:04,"By Branwen Jeffreys

Health correspondent, BBC News



More women and young people are developing health problems

Teenage drinkers

Of 115 specialists who replied to a BBC questionnaire, 77 said they had treated at least one patient aged under 25.

Many said the social acceptability of heavy drinking was the most important influence on young people.

The warning comes as a new alliance calls for a rise in alcohol taxes, and a bar on TV advertising before 9pm.

I've seen patients who've been admitted with pretty catastrophic bleeding from stomach and oesophagus with no prior warning of a problem of their liver.

Dr Jonathan Mitchell

Consultant hepatologist

'Alcohol killed my son' Send us your comments Europe's attitudes to alcohol

Twenty-four organisations, representing doctors and charities, have joined together to form the Alcohol Health Alliance.

It wants the government to make alcohol misuse a higher priority.

Public health minister Dawn Primarolo said the government had already drawn up a plan for concerted action.

The drink industry says alcohol consumption is falling, and that increasing the cost would hit the majority of people who enjoy a drink in moderation.

Generational shift

The comments of the specialists who responded to the BBC reveal a generational shift on hospital wards around the UK.

Whereas before most hospital consultants would have seen patients in their fifties or sixties in the past, they now describe seeing patients in their early twenties with alcohol-related hepatitis, and women whose livers are permanently damaged with the scarring known as cirrhosis by the time they are 30.

Dr Jonathan Mitchell, a consultant hepatologist in Plymouth, is one of the specialists who contacted the BBC.

He said many of his patients did not realise the permanent damage to their health caused by regular heavy drinking.

Until it reaches a critical stage most liver disease is virtually without symptoms.

Dr Mitchell said: ""I've seen patients who've been admitted with pretty catastrophic bleeding from stomach and oesophagus with no prior warning of a problem of their liver.

""Others may present with jaundice or swelling of the abdomen because there's a lot of fluid in the abdomen.

""All these three things are signs of quite advanced liver disease and can come out of the blue.""

Heavy drinking 'normal'

Fatty deposits gradually build up on the liver as alcohol interferes with the way it would normally be processed.

What follows is an inflammation within the liver which often leads to low grade hepatitis.

Although the liver has a remarkable capacity to regenerate the damage eventually reaches the stage where the scarring permanently alters the structure of the liver.

For some patients this will lead to an agonising wait on the liver transplant waiting list before they are forty.

He is not alone in his concerns that the normalisation of heavy drinking is putting a generation at risk from a silent killer.

Of the 115 consultants who contacted the BBC 101 said there had been an increase in the number of patients they were seeing for alcohol-related disease.

The shift in the age profile of their patients is also very marked, with 77 saying they had treated a patient under the age of 25.

If you look at the burden of damage to society, it's hugely greater for alcohol than for drugs.

Professor Ian Gilmore

Royal College of Physicians

Young addicts beat the bottle Expert tips on drinking safely

The doctor's responses are a depressing snapshot of the ages and condition of the patients they see:

24-year-old woman with advanced cirrhosis who died

25-year-old with advanced alcoholic cirrhosis

19-year-old female with end stage liver disease

21-year-old who died from acute alcohol poisoning.

While attention is often focused on the social disorder caused by binge drinking, many doctors say the serious health effects are not given enough attention.

Professor Ian Gilmore, president of the Royal College of Physicians, is one of the leading figures in the new campaign.

He said: ""If you look at the burden of damage to society, it's hugely greater for alcohol than for drugs, but the majority of money has always gone on drugs, partly because of the strong link to crime.""

Government view

The government has recently beefed up its Home Office target for reducing harm from alcohol.

It has also introduced a cross-departmental Alcohol Strategy.

This includes a public information campaign to promote sensible drinking, an independent review of alcohol pricing and promotion, toughened enforcement of underage sales by retailers and plans to introduce more help for people who want to drink less.

Dawn Primarolo, the public health minister, said the government had introduced a comprehensive strategy to tackle problem drinking.

She said tax on alcohol in the UK was already the second highest in Europe, and only about 1% of pubs had extended opening hours since extended licensing laws were introduced.

A bigger problem was the discounting of prices by supermarkets and off licences.

She said: ""We're looking at where it's available, who it's available to, how it's being marketed, what the targeting is and what we can do to give clear messages and to make those who are selling it responsible.""","['alcohol', 'patients', 'liver', 'health', 'bbc', 'hard', 'young', 'disease', 'damage', 'warning', 'drinking', 'stage', 'hits', 'problem']","The warning comes as a new alliance calls for a rise in alcohol taxes, and a bar on TV advertising before 9pm.

Obituary: Dora Bryan,"Dora Bryan, who has died 91, was a talented character actress who played everything from Ibsen to Absolutely Fabulous.",,None,"Image caption Bryan starred in her own BBC show in 1964, in which she sang and performed sketches from London revues and musicals

Dora Bryan was a talented character actress who could turn her hand to everything from musicals to Shakespeare, farce to tragedy.

The variety of the roles she played, including parts in plays by Ibsen and Pinter, belied her caricature as a wide-eyed dizzy blonde.

Born Dora May Broadbent in Southport, Lancashire in 1924, she went to a council school and, encouraged by her ambitious mother, made her first stage appearance at the age of 12, in pantomime in Manchester.

Image caption Bryan recorded the post-war radio show Much Binding in the Marsh with Nicholas Parsons (far right)

During World War 2 she worked in repertory theatre and with the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) - an organisation set up in 1939 to provide entertainment for British armed forces personnel during the war.

She moved to London in 1945 and appeared in a number of West End productions - notably in the Lyric and Globe revues in the 1950s.

Image caption In 2000, Bryan joined the cast of Last of the Summer Wine but left five years later

She changed her name to Bryan, taking it from the match manufacturers Bryant and May. She lost the closing ""t"" when a theatre programme misspelled her name.

In 1966, the actress played the title role in Hello, Dolly at Drury Lane, eating a full chicken dinner on stage six nights a week and at two matinees.

In 1968 she played nine parts as the star of They Don't Grow on Trees at the Prince of Wales.

Later, she was in the National Theatre's She Stoops to Conquer (for which she won an award) and a revival of Charlie Girl. And she took the West End by storm in a lavish 2002 musical production of The Full Monty.

Speaking to Michael Parkinson on Desert Island Discs in 1987, she said musical theatre had always held a special place in her heart.

""I was in rep for seven years and to get a marvellous part in a play is great, it really is super, particularly if it's a funny part and there is nothing like making an audience laugh.

""But with musicals, I like the atmosphere backstage. You go backstage in a real theatre, in a real plush and gilt theatre and you can shout to the dressing room opposite you and you're all clustered in together, you get a real theatrical atmosphere.""

Her theatre career was crowned with a prestigious Olivier award in recognition of her role, as Meg, in a National Theatre production of Harold Pinter's The Birthday Party.

Ab Fab

But she was not just a stage actress - she made her big screen debut in 1948's The Fallen Idol. About 40 further films followed, including The Blue Lamp, The Great St. Trinian's Train Robbery, The Sandwich Man and Two a Penny.

The peak of her career came as she played the domineering, promiscuous, alcoholic mother, Helen in the 1961 film A Taste of Honey. The role won her a Bafta award for best actress.

Image caption In 1994, she was cast in the play Bed, which presented a vast dreamscape of seven very old people - all of whom share the same vast bed

Image caption Bryan and June Whitfield acted together in the fourth series of Absolutely Fabulous

On television, she appeared in According to Dora and Both Ends Meet and, latterly, she joined a star-studded cast in Last of the Summer Wine.

In an interview with the Church Times in 2006, she said: ""I got my part as Roz in Last of the Summer Wine through Thora Hird. We had always been friends, and always nattered on about the old days.

""We knew actors most people have now forgotten. Then, a few years ago, she suddenly said: 'I wish you were in it with me.'""

Image caption Among Bryan's numerous TV appearances was an episode of Casualty

She also brought the house down with a recurring cameo role in Absolutely Fabulous as June Whitfield's on-screen friend Dolly.

This is Your Life

Dora Bryan was also in the post-war radio show Much Binding in the Marsh. And she once made a novelty record, All I Want for Christmas is a Beatle, which became an unexpected hit.

However her life was also touched by tragedy.

Her adopted daughter Georgina died from alcoholism, her son Daniel endured a debilitating illness and she herself experienced alcoholism.

She told the Church Times she was a member of Alcoholics Anonymous.

""I got very lonely on tour,"" she said, ""and used to order room-service with a bottle of wine, which was not the answer. I don't miss it at all, and just enjoy coffee or tea.""

Bryan's husband, Lancashire County Cricketer Bill Lawton, died from Alzheimer's in 2008 and Dora, in her later years, became unable to work, as short-term memory loss affected her ability to learn lines.

She was honoured twice by TV tribute show This Is Your Life, in 1962 and again in 1989.

In her book, According to Dora, she remembered her first appearance.

""I was hoping the BBC would have filmed a message from my brother John in South Africa. It never occurred to me that they would have gone to all the trouble and expense of flying him from Cape Town, and I must admit that when he walked on to the stage with his wife Marguerite, I cried a little from sheer happiness.""

On her second appearance, host Eamonn Andrews ""ambushed"" the actress in her living room, before whisking her to the TV studio to hear tributes from her friends and family.

""Tonight?"" exclaimed the star. ""Oh dear! I've got to do some auditions at four!""

Her final film appearance was in Gone to the Dogs (2006) opposite Anthony Booth.

The indomitable actress said that in her life she was helped through the bad times by her family, her faith and the next challenge around the corner.","['tv', 'wine', 'obituary', 'caption', 'role', 'dora', 'played', 'stage', 'bryan', 'actress', 'theatre']","Image caption Bryan starred in her own BBC show in 1964, in which she sang and performed sketches from London revues and musicalsDora Bryan was a talented character actress who could turn her hand to everything from musicals to Shakespeare, farce to tragedy.

Ymosod ar noson gyntaf yn y coleg,Dyn alcoholig yn cael ei garcharu am ddau ymosodiad wedi digwyddiad ar ei noson gyntaf yn y coleg.,,None,"Image caption Cafodd yr achos ei glywed yn Llys y Goron Yr Wyddgrug

Cafodd dyn 32 oed ei garcharu am flwyddyn am ymosodiad rhyw ac am ymosod ar ddyn gyda chyllell yn dilyn digwyddiad ar ei noson gyntaf yn y coleg.

Roedd Carl Wayne Roberts, o Gaergybi, yn alcoholig ond nid oedd wedi cael diod am gyfnod hir, ac roedd wedi gwella i'r fath raddau fel ei fod wedi cael cynnig lle ar gwrs cerddoriaeth yng Ngholeg Harlech.

Ond ar ei noson gyntaf yno fe aeth i'r dafarn gyda'i gyd-fyfyrwyr a chymryd diod o alcohol am y tro cyntaf ers tro.

Dechreuodd ymddwyn yn ymosodol a gofynnwyd iddo adael y dafarn.

Cyllell

Yn ddiweddarach fe gyflawnodd ymosodiad rhyw ar ferch ifanc drwy roi ei law i lawr ei throwsus a thu mewn i'w dillad isaf, a gafaelodd yn ei gwddf tra'n gafael mewn cyllell.

Pan geisiodd dyn ifanc arall ymyrryd, fe wthiodd y gyllell i wyneb y dyn gan achosi anaf i'w foch.

Dywedodd y Barnwr Rhys Rowlands y gallai'r gyllell fod mynd i lygad y dyn ac achosi anaf llawer gwaeth.

Roedd Roberts wedi cael ei ddedfrydu'n flaenorol i ddedfryd o garchar amhenodol er mwyn gwarchod y cyhoedd wedi iddo drywanu dyn yn ei goes gyda photel.

Wrth ei amddiffyn dywedodd Mark Connor bod ei gleient am ymddiheuro am ei ymddygiad, a'i fod wedi siomi ei hun, ei deulu a'i ffrindiau.

Pan gafodd ei rhyddhau o'i ddedfryd flaenorol, ymunodd Roberts gyda grwp Alcoholics Anonymous ac roedd wedi gwneud gwelliannau mawr ac wedi cael cynnig mynd ar y cwrs.

Dywedodd Mr Connor: ""Y gwirionedd yw nad oedd yn ddigon cryf yn emosiynol ar gyfer y fath newid.

""Roedd yn pryderu rhywfaint am ei noson gyntaf yno, ac fe gymrodd ddiod gan feddwl y gallai ymdopi ar ôl tair blynedd heb yfed.""

Ychwanegodd bod Roberts yn benderfynol o newid ei fywyd, ac roedd eisoes wedi bod ar gyrsiau priodol er mwyn troi dalen newydd.

Cafodd ei ddedfrydu i garchar am flwyddyn gyda chyfnod estynedig o ddwy flynedd ar drwydded i ddilyn, a bydd rhaid iddo gofrestru fel troseddwr rhyw am gyfnod o saith mlynedd.","['ymosod', 'fe', 'y', 'ar', 'wedi', 'gyntaf', 'dyn', 'gyda', 'ei', 'noson', 'yn', 'ac', 'roberts', 'coleg']","Image caption Cafodd yr achos ei glywed yn Llys y Goron Yr WyddgrugCafodd dyn 32 oed ei garcharu am flwyddyn am ymosodiad rhyw ac am ymosod ar ddyn gyda chyllell yn dilyn digwyddiad ar ei noson gyntaf yn y coleg.

Ex-burglar says 'some people need to be in prison',A prolific burglar with more than 100 convictions says a second chance helped him turn his life around but some people need to be in jail.,,None,"Image caption Ex-offender Jodie Hind has been in and out of prison since the age of 14

Ex-burglar and drug pusher Jodie Hind has a string of convictions longer than his arm - more than 100. So many in fact, he cannot remember the exact number.

He was first jailed for theft on his 14th birthday and for the next 16 years was in and out of prison dozens of times for a ""mind-blowing"" number of offences.

At his lowest ebb he was breaking into houses to steal money to feed a heroin and crack cocaine habit.

And when things were going ""well"", in his eyes, he was making £1,000 a day selling drugs and spending it on sports cars, jewellery and clothes.

But every few months he would find himself back inside. According to the 34-year-old, most people had written him off and did not believe he could break the cycle of crime.

But break it he did, with a lot of professional help, and today he is drug-free and has not committed a crime for more than four years.

'Big baby'

Society was better off when I was inside before I had confronted my problems Jodie Hind

On Wednesday Judge Peter Bowers caused controversy when he said burglars were ""courageous"" and decided to give serial burglar Richard Rochford a supervision order instead of jail.

The Teesside Crown Court judge also said he thought prison did criminals ""little good"".

Mr Hind agrees that jail does not always work, but many offenders still need to be locked up.

He said: ""Some people need to be in prison for the safety of the public. Society was better off when I was inside before I had confronted my problems.

Image caption Jessie Jacobs said ""the whole area of justice"" needs reform

""I was not facing up to the fact I had character defects and these were were manifesting themselves in addictions such as drug-taking and alcohol.

""I had problems such as managing anger, I was like a big baby, and replacing one addiction with another.

""But I have a conscience and I feel most shame about dealing in drugs. I am also haunted about burgling people's homes.

""I thought I could cheat my way through life but with lots of help I have turned my life around and changed my way of thinking.""

'Without hope'

Through the help of Alcoholics Anonymous and other addiction agencies, Mr Hind now works for Five Lamps, a Stockton charity which helps the unemployed get jobs or start their own business.

Mr Hind said his father was an alcoholic but on the whole he and his sister had a good upbringing. But he kept lapsing into crime because he was ""immature and without hope"".

The judge could have chosen his words more carefully - burglars are not brave but they may well be desperate Jessie Jacobs, Chief Executive of charity A Way Out

He said: ""My recovery was very public. I've decided to stay in the area where I committed my crimes and a lot of people don't approve of me.

""But I believe in reform, I am accountable for my actions. I am up for what the judge has said, some people should be in prison but the prison numbers are too big.

""I believe with the right help people can be reformed.""

Mr Hind is not afraid of having a relapse. He said: ""Everyday I take stock. I have changed my way of thinking.

""I am responsible for my actions and learn from other people who have overcome their problems.""

Jessie Jacobs is the chief executive of A Way Out, a charity which helps women and young people to tackle a range of problems including depression, addiction, self harm and exploitation.

It has been running for 10 years and helps about 1,000 people a year.

Ms Jacobs said: ""The judge could have chosen his words more carefully. Burglars are not brave but they may well be desperate. So while I do not condone the judge's choice of words I welcome the fact that he has opened up a debate.

""He said he thought jail rarely worked and I believe we need to reexamine and reform the whole area of justice.

你是不是工作狂？回答几个问题就知道,超时工作和无法控制想要工作的欲望并非一回事，但二者界限何在？怎样才知道自己是不是工作狂？如何确诊“工作成瘾”症状？,,2016-11-16 00:00:00,"Image copyright Image caption （图片来源：Alamy）

所有人都喜欢努力工作的员工。

事实上，多工作、多赚钱已经被很多人视作现代社会成功的标志。能被贴上工作狂的标签更是被许多人视为一种荣誉。

但对某些人来说，着迷于工作却需要付出很多代价。健康、人际关系甚至工作质量都会受到影响——代价不可谓不高。

无论如何，强烈的工作欲望多年来已经导致很多人向治疗师和自助团体寻求帮助。这甚至会引发过劳死。日本政府本月早些时候发布的一项研究显示，五分之一的日本职场人士面临过劳死的风险。

过劳死不只是日本的问题。工作狂互戒会（Workaholics Anonymous）效仿嗜酒者互戒会（Alcoholics Anonymous）的做法制定了12步法则，他们于今年6月在英国举行了首届国际大会，吸引了来自世界各地的与会者出席。

关于工作狂的成因，目前还没有太多的相关研究。但这种现状正在改变——最近几年，这种现象开始获得更多关注，人们也不再仅仅把它当成一个流行词来看待。

Image caption “工作狂”并不是一种正式的疾病——但它绝不仅仅是一个流行词（图片来源：Getty Images）

美国精神病学协会的精神疾病诊断与统计手册是诊断精神疾病的黄金法则，但工作狂却并未被其认可为一种疾病。

然而，尽管没有精确的定义，但工作狂对人们产生的影响却有可能与健康、职业和心理问题存在关联，而研究人员也在关注此事。乔治亚大学最近开展的元分析——对现有的工作狂研究文献展开定量总结——显示，与工作态度和工作方法更为健康的同事相比，工作狂的效率反而更低。

挪威卑尔根大学今年5月发布的一项大型研究将工作狂倾向与其他精神病问题关联起来，包括强迫症、焦虑症和抑郁症。

工作成瘾

如果努力工作对你产生了负面影响该怎么办？哪些迹象能让人们确认自己“工作成瘾”？北卡罗来纳州精神治疗师布莱恩·罗宾逊（Bryan Robinson）表示，工作狂是一种强烈的冲动——它令人们难以摆脱工作的意愿和想法。罗宾逊曾经对工作成瘾的影响展开过早期研究，还写了一本名为《拴在办公桌上》（Chained to the Desk）的工作狂指导手册。

“工作狂不是根据工作时间来定义的，而是要考虑我们内心的想法。”他说。

“工作狂在滑雪时想着回去工作。而健康的人则是在工作时想着去滑雪。”

罗宾逊的客户里就有一些人因为长时间加班而离婚、失业或者遭遇健康问题。他回忆道，有一位客户曾经骗自己的丈夫说她在健身房，但她实际上却是在工作，之后再换上运动装，用水浸透全身，让自己看上去像是满身是汗。

你身边是否也有类似的人？

但乔治亚大学的元分析显示，与其他同事相比，工作狂的业绩未必最好，在办公室里的活跃度也未必很高。

作为这项研究的负责人，乔治亚大学工业和组织心理学教授玛丽莎·克拉克（Malissa A Clark）表示，工作狂的职场压力更大，工作满意度和生活满意度更低，也更易疲惫。

危险信号

卑尔根工作成瘾量表（Bergen Work Addiction Scale）使用7项基本标准来判断工作成瘾的程度，每个标准有以下5个选项：（1）从不，（2）很少，（3）有时，（4）经常，（5）总是。如果在7项标准中至少有4项选择“经常”或“总是”，你可能就是工作狂。

你心想如何才能多腾出一些时间来工作。

你的实际工作时间远超最初的计划。

你为了降低负罪感、焦虑感、无助感和抑郁感而工作。

别人曾经建议你减少工作时间，但你却置之不理。

如果无法工作，你会感到紧张。你因为工作而放弃业余爱好、休闲活动和体育锻炼。

你工作量太大，甚至连身体健康都受到了负面影响。

Image caption 由于你无法立刻戒掉工作，所以必须制定一项计划，控制好自己与工作之间的关系（图片来源：Getty Images）

这些人的工作与生活之间的冲突更大，身体和心理健康度更低，包括婚姻在内的家庭关系也受到了不利影响。

她补充道，尽管工作狂经常与上进心、竞争欲、有野心和高效率联系在一起，但实际上，“积极影响并不多。”

评估与求助

如果你认为自己可能有问题，可以通过一些方法进行自我评估。

挪威研究人员制作的卑尔根工作成瘾量表可以帮助你对自己工作时的行为、感受和态度进行衡量。工作狂互戒会也会提供一份在线问卷，可以帮助你判断自己是否需要寻求帮助。

专家表示，第一步是承认自己有问题。

罗宾逊自称是一个处在恢复期的工作狂，他的治疗手段包括正念、心理治疗、改变行为和揭露根本问题。“这种情况存在一些根本原因。有的时候是自尊，有的时候是一种调节焦虑的方法。”他说。

61岁的鲍勃承认他存在这方面的问题。妻子告诉他，她已经受够了现在的生活：她经常半夜醒来发现丈夫不在身边，而是在办公室里加班。鲍勃是工作狂互戒会的外联主任，这是一项志愿工作。为了避免别人暴露身份，他拒绝在这篇报道中使用自己的全名

“让工作狂上瘾的‘药物’就是肾上腺素。”他说，“紧张、压力、危机、最后期限，这都会使人兴奋，让人分泌肾上腺素，从而拼命地工作。”

鲍勃5岁时就开始工作了——帮助哥哥送报纸、回收易拉罐和玻璃瓶、修剪草坪、铲除积雪。他后来成了一名成功的商人，但健康状况却每况愈下。他表示，如果不向专业人士求助，他的家庭生活就会遭到破坏。他的妻子已经受够了这种生活。

“正是因为她受够了这样的生活，我才下定决心参加这个项目。”鲍勃说。

但跟吃饭一样，工作不可能一下子就完全放弃。既然如此，又该如何控制不停工作的冲动呢？“应该制定一份计划，然后按照计划行事，而不是随时强迫自己处理所有事情。”鲍勃说。这意味着要安排好工作时间，每次只能集中精力做一件事情。如果有其他事情突然出现，不能手忙脚乱地同时处理所有事情，而应该查看计划，并重新确定优先顺序。

其他的治疗方案还包括寻找精通这一领域的治疗师。或者，也可以参加门诊研讨会和门诊项目。而现在还出现了一些住院治疗项目，例如美国俄亥俄州的The Bridge To Recovery就计划为工作狂提供帮助，同时辅以强迫症、焦虑症和抑郁症等方面的其他治疗。

但克拉克表示，目前的治疗方案之所以匮乏，主要原因是缺乏相关研究。“关于工作狂起因的研究本身就不多，而关于工作狂与临床症状相互关系的研究更是几乎没有。”挪威的研究算是其中之一。

她表示，现在需要进行更多的研究，“这样才能让这个问题变得更加主流，而不再是小众的流行词。这的确会对人们的生活和幸福构成明确的负面影响。”

事實上，多工作、多賺錢已經被很多人視作現代社會成功的標誌。能被貼上工作狂的標籤更是被許多人視為一種榮譽。

美國精神病學協會的精神疾病診斷與統計手冊是診斷精神疾病的黃金法則，但工作狂卻並未被其認可為一種疾病。

然而，儘管沒有精確的定義，但工作狂對人們產生的影響卻有可能與健康、職業和心理問題存在關聯，而研究人員也在關注此事。喬治亞大學最近開展的元分析——對現有的工作狂研究文獻展開定量總結——顯示，與工作態度和工作方法更為健康的同事相比，工作狂的效率反而更低。

挪威卑爾根大學今年5月發佈的一項大型研究將工作狂傾向與其他精神病問題關聯起來，包括強迫症、焦慮症和抑鬱症。

工作成癮

如果努力工作對你產生了負面影響該怎麼辦？哪些跡象能讓人們確認自己「工作成癮」？北卡羅來納州精神治療師布萊恩·羅賓遜（Bryan Robinson）表示，工作狂是一種強烈的衝動——它令人們難以擺脫工作的意願和想法。羅賓遜曾經對工作成癮的影響展開過早期研究，還寫了一本名為《拴在辦公桌上》（Chained to the Desk）的工作狂指導手冊。

「工作狂不是根據工作時間來定義的，而是要考慮我們內心的想法。」他說。

「工作狂在滑雪時想著回去工作。而健康的人則是在工作時想著去滑雪。」

羅賓遜的客戶裏就有一些人因為長時間加班而離婚、失業或者遭遇健康問題。他回憶道，有一位客戶曾經騙自己的丈夫說她在健身房，但她實際上卻是在工作，之後再換上運動裝，用水浸透全身，讓自己看上去像是滿身是汗。

Naomi Campbell wins privacy case,,,2004-05-06 11:56:31,"Miss Campbell will receive the High Court damages of £3,500

By a three-to-two majority, the Law Lords overturned an Appeal Court ruling that the Mirror had been justified in publishing information about her.

Miss Campbell had objected to the publication of pictures of her leaving drug addiction treatment in early 2001.

The Appeal Court had ordered her to pay the paper's £350,000 legal costs after overturning a High Court ruling.

Lord Hope, who voted in favour of Miss Campbell, said on Thursday: ""Despite the weight that must be given to the right to freedom of expression that the press needs if it is to play its role effectively, I would hold that there was here an infringement of Miss Campbell's right to privacy that cannot be justified.""

It is not possible to sue for invasion of privacy in Britain, but experts say the ruling could have serious implications for the way the media covers the private lives of celebrities.

This is a very good day for lying drug-abusing prima donnas who want to have their cake with the media, and the right to then shamelessly guzzle it with their Cristal champagne

Piers Morgan

Daily Mirror editor

The case centred on the publication in February 2001 of a report about her drug addiction, including a photograph of her leaving a Narcotics Anonymous meeting in King's Road, Chelsea.

Miss Campbell's lawyer Keith Schilling said the supermodel was ""delighted"" with the ruling.

""It is not only a vindication for her personally but, more importantly, represents a real advantage for the rights of people to maintain important elements of their privacy, particularly when related to therapy and people who need to have treatment.""

The Law Lords reinstated the High Court award of £3,500, based on breach of confidentiality and breach of duty under the 1998 Data Protection Act.

The judgment leaves the Daily Mirror facing a total legal costs bill of more than £1m.

Lords Nicholls and Hoffmann said they would have dismissed Miss Campbell's appeal and found for the Mirror.

Lord Hoffmann said: ""From a journalistic point of view, photographs are an essential part of the story.

""The picture carried the message, more strongly than anything in the text alone, that the Mirror's story was true.""

High Court orders £3,500 damages from Mirror Oct 2002: Appeal Court overturns High Court ruling May 2004: Law Lords overturn Appeal Court decision, reinstating High Court ruling and damages

Law Lords' ruling

Commenting on the judgment, Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan said: ""This is a very good day for lying drug-abusing prima donnas who want to have their cake with the media, and the right to then shamelessly guzzle it with their Cristal champagne.

""Five senior judges found for the Mirror throughout the various hearings in this case, four for Naomi Campbell. Yet she wins.

""If ever there was a less deserving case for creating what is effectively a back door privacy law it would be Ms Campbell, but that's showbiz.""

Media lawyer Mark Stephens told BBC News 24 the privacy laws in Britain remain ""incredibly confused...and the judges have been grappling with it"" as evidenced by the split decision.

""The much hoped-for clear guidance on the law of privacy hasn't yet been put forward. The law will remain in a state of flux for some considerable time yet.""

Celebrity publicist Max Clifford said the ruling would not make any difference to newspapers wanting to publish such pictures in the future.

""Editors will look at every situation and judge them on their own merits,"" he told BBC News 24.

He said that it was unlikely the government would introduce a privacy law as such a move would antagonise the press.

Choice of tipple 'determines different moods',"Spirits may make you angry or tearful, while red wine or beer may make you relax, research says.",,None,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Do you know how alcohol changes your mood?

Different types of alcoholic drink change and shape your mood in different ways, says a study into drinking and emotions.

Spirits may make you feel angry, sexy or tearful, while red wine or beer may make you feel relaxed, say researchers.

They questioned nearly 30,000 people aged 18-34 from 21 different countries for the study in the journal BMJ Open.

All the respondents drank beer, wine and spirits, and many said each type of alcohol had a different effect on them.

While having a few drinks can be enjoyable, researchers hope their findings will help highlight the dangers of dependent drinking.

Angry outbursts

People build up tolerance to alcohol over time and can end up drinking more to feel the same ""positive"" effects that they enjoy.

But they also risk getting negative ones too, says researcher Prof Mark Bellis from Public Health Wales NHS Trust.

The anonymous online survey, which recruited respondents via newspaper and magazine adverts and social media, found:

Red wine appeared to make people more lethargic than white wine

Respondents were most likely to report feeling relaxed when drinking red wine or beer

More than 40% said drinking spirits made them feel sexy

Over half said drinking spirits also gave them energy and confidence

But around a third said they felt aggressive when drinking spirits

Drinking spirits was more likely than all other drink types to be associated with feelings of aggression, illness, restlessness and tearfulness

Men were significantly more likely than women to associate feelings of aggression with all types of alcohol, particularly heavier drinkers

However, the findings show only an association and do not explain the reasons for changes.

Prof Bellis said the setting in which the alcohol was consumed was an important factor that the study tried to take into consideration by asking about drinking at home and outside of the home.

""Young people will often drink spirits on a night out, whereas wine might be drunk more at home, with a meal.

""There will be an element of expectation too. Someone who wants to relax might choose to have a beer or a glass of wine.""

He said the way different drinks are marketed and promoted might encourage people to select certain drinks to suit different moods, but that this could backfire if it triggered negative emotions.

""People may rely on alcohol to help them feel a certain way. People might drink to feel more confident or relaxed but they also risk other negative emotional responses too.""

Prof Bellis and his colleagues at King's College London said the findings suggested that dependent drinkers might rely on alcohol to generate the positive emotions they associated with drinking - they were five times more likely to feel energised than low-risk drinkers.

He also said the study revealed a difference between men and women's emotional relationship with different alcoholic drinks.

""We got stronger emotional relationships with women across pretty well every type of emotion, except for aggression."" Aggression, he said, was more likely to be felt among men.

Dr John Larsen, from Drinkaware, said: ""This study highlights the importance of understanding why people choose to drink certain alcoholic drinks and what effect they expect these drinks will have on them.

""The UK chief medical officers' guideline for both men and women states that in order to keep health risks from alcohol to a low level it is safest not to be drinking more than 14 units a week on a regular basis.""

That equates to 12 single measures of spirits, six pints of beer or six 175ml glasses of wine a week.

Experts say setting a minimum unit price of 50 pence per unit would help cut alcohol-related deaths.

A minimum price policy will come into force on 1 May 2018 in Scotland.

Legislation to establish a minimum price is currently under active consideration by the Welsh Government and by the Irish Senate. There are no plans yet to do the same in England, although the Home Office says the policy is under review.","['drinks', 'moods', 'alcohol', 'drink', 'wine', 'choice', 'study', 'different', 'determines', 'drinking', 'feel', 'tipple', 'likely', 'spirits']","Different types of alcoholic drink change and shape your mood in different ways, says a study into drinking and emotions.

'Major improvement' in open jails,,,2009-01-28 10:02:20,"The Robert Foye case fuelled concern about open prisons The case of an on-the-run prisoner who raped a schoolgirl has led to improvements in Scotland's open jails, the chief prisons inspector has said. Robert Foye attacked the 16-year-old in August 2007 after absconding from Castle Huntly open prison near Dundee, raising questions about public safety. Inspector Dr Andrew McLellan said procedures had now been tightened. But his inspection of Castle Huntly, and Scotland's second open prison, Noranside, raised several concerns. Delivering his report on the two prisons, following an inspection in September last year, Dr McLellan said they were failing to offer proper programmes to tackle prisoners' offending behaviour. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. And he said there was ""almost no preparation"" for inmates in closed prisons for a move to open conditions. Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill said he was reassured by the report, adding open prisons were vital in helping offenders back into communities at the end of their sentences. Dr McLellan said no Scottish prison had been the subject of more public concern in the past year than the open estate. He cited public concerns of a lax regime and that open prisons were ""too easy to get into and too easy to get out of"". In 2008, Foye was jailed for a minimum of nine years for the rape, which he carried out in Cumbernauld. Mr MacAskill later apologised to the schoolgirl and ordered improvements to the system. 'Decisive moment' Foye was serving a sentence for attempting to murder a police officer when he absconded from Castle Huntly, after being allowed out to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Describing his inspection as a ""decisive moment for the future of the open estate"", Dr McLellan said the Scottish Prison Service had learned lessons and ""tightened considerably"" the requirements for admission to open prison. ""This current inspection report demonstrates that significant change has taken place this year in the open estate,"" his report stated. ""Much of the change can be attributed to reaction to that case of rape by an absconding prisoner."" Castle Huntly aims help prisoners back into the community Inspectors said the absconding rate was still high, but dropping, while the number of short-term prisoners had ""reduced considerably"" in favour of long-term inmates preparing to be released. But Dr McLellan said accredited programmes to address offending behaviour should be introduced, while there needed to be more opportunities for inmates' families to better engage with the system before they were given home leave. He said prisoners must be better prepared for moving from closed to open prisons and called for further improvements to community risk assessment procedures. Inspectors issued eight recommendations in all, including calls to improve healthcare facilities at Noranside, in Angus, where milk and coffee was found being stored in the medication fridge. Mr MacAskill said the prison service was already acting on the recommendations. He said of Dr McLellen's inspection: ""I am particularly reassured he has found significant improvements in the risk assessment and risk management of prisoners following the Robert Foye case.""

Noranside prison to close for Christmas,,,2009-12-06 14:10:52,"HMP Noranside currently houses about 100 prisoners An open jail is to close for Christmas while inmates go home on leave. The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) confirmed Noranside prison, in Angus, will be mothballed for a week over the festive period. The prison currently has about 100 inmates.

It is not known how many prisoners will be given leave. The spokesman added: ""That is the plan at the moment - we did that last year.

Scottish Conservative MSP ""That is part of the parole process. If the prisoners misbehave or breach their conditions they are back in closed conditions."" The larger Castle Huntly, near Dundee, would be able to accommodate the reduced open population from Noranside over the festive period on its own. Serious offenders, including killers coming towards the end of their sentences, could be among those released. But Tory community safety spokesman John Lamont branded the plans ""quite incredible"". He said: ""Many victims of these criminals, and families of those killed, are still bearing emotional or physical scars and they will have to watch in horror as they are sent home to enjoy a week with their families."" Political rows A Scottish government spokeman said: ""Only prisoners that have undergone a stringent risk assessment, conducted by the Scottish Prison Service, will be considered for being tested in home conditions - one of the vital functions of the open estate - over the Christmas period. ""These prisoners have already been subject to rigorous assessment prior to their progression to open prison."" The open estate has been at the centre of political rows in recent years. Sex offender Robert Foye absconded from Castle Huntly in 2007 after being let out to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting and raped a 16-year-old girl before being recaptured. This led to a tightening of controls over who is sent to open jails. But this year murderer John Brown and armed robber Brian Martin - dubbed ""the Hawk"" - both absconded in quick succession from Castle Huntly.

Bạn có phải là người nghiện công việc?,Có sự khác biệt giữa người làm việc nhiều và người bị cuốn vào việc ngoài tầm kiểm soát?,,None,"Bản quyền hình ảnh Getty Images Image caption Nghiện việc không phải là một chứng rối loạn chính thức, nó chỉ hơn một thuật ngữ khá thông thường

Có sự khác biệt giữa người làm việc nhiều và người bị cuốn vào việc ngoài tầm kiểm soát. Ranh giới nằm ở chỗ nào?

Ai cũng thích người làm việc tích cực.

Thực tế, làm việc nhiều và kiếm được nhiều tiền là điều nhiều người coi là dấu hiệu của sự thành công. Trong khi bị gọi là nghiện việc thường bị xem là không được hay ho lắm.

Nhưng với một số người thì nhu cầu ám ảnh về công việc phải trả giá bằng mọi thứ khác, đó là sức khỏe, quan hệ và thậm chí cả chất lượng công việc. Đó là giá rất đắt.

Cho dù thế nào thì sự thúc bách làm việc đã dẫn đến việc người ta phải điều trị và tham gia các nhóm tự hỗ trợ trong nhiều năm. Thậm chí nghiện việc có thể gây tử vong. Đầu tháng này, một nghiên cứu của chính phủ Nhật cho hay 1/5 lực lượng lao động Nhật có nguy cơ tử vong vì làm việc quá sức.

Làm việc quá tải không chỉ là vấn đề nan giải ở Nhật Bản. Chương trình 12 bước Workaholics Anonymous phỏng theo chương trình Alcoholics Anonymous, đã tổ chức hội nghị quốc tế đầu tiên ở Anh trong tháng 6, với những người tham dự từ khắp thế giới.

Bản quyền hình ảnh Getty Images Image caption Ai cũng thích người làm việc tích cực?

Cho tới nay, có ít nghiên cứu về nguyên nhân gây ra nghiện việc. Nhưng những năm gần đây đã có thay đổi, hiện tượng nghiện việc được chú ý hơn và đang được xử lý, chứ không chỉ được coi là một từ thông dụng.

Nghiện việc hiện không được công nhận là một bệnh y học theo Cẩm Nang Chẩn Đoán Và Thống Kê Của Hội Bác Sĩ Tâm Thần (là tiêu chuẩn chuẩn mực để chẩn đoán bệnh tâm thần).

Nhưng ngay cả khi không có định nghĩa chính xác thì tác động của nó có liên quan đến sức khỏe, nơi làm việc và những vấn đề tinh thần, và các nhà nghiên cứu ghi nhận là có. Một nghiên cứu toàn diện mới đây, mang tính định lượng, của Đại học Georgia cho thấy, ngoài những vấn đề khác, những người nghiện việc có năng suất kém các đồng nghiệp có quan điểm lành mạnh hơn trong công việc.

Một nghiên cứu khác lớn hơn được xuất bản vào tháng Năm của trường Đại học Bergen ở Na Uy, đã chứng minh mối quan hệ giữa nghiện việc với các vấn đề tâm lý khác, như chứng rối loạn cưỡng bức ám ảnh, lo lắng và trầm cảm.

Không phải là công việc tốt nhất

Nhưng khi nào thì làm việc vất vả trở thành tiêu cực? Điều gì có thể làm ai đó tin là mình bị nghiện việc? Nghiện việc là một sự cưỡng bách, một sự thôi thúc ngoài tầm kiểm soát và ám ảnh phải làm việc hoặc phải nghĩ về làm việc, Bryan Robinson, một bác sỹ điều trị tâm thần ở Bắc Carolina và đã thực hiện nghiên cứu tác động của nghiện việc, tác giả cuốn cẩm nang Bị Khóa Vào Bàn Làm Việc, nói.

Biểu hiện nghiện việc Thang đo mức nghiện việc Bergen sử dụng 7 tiêu chí chính, điểm cho như sau: (1) Không bao giờ, (2) Hiếm khi, (3) Đôi khi, (4) Thường xuyên, và (5) Luôn luôn. Nếu bạn có điểm ""Thường xuyên"" hoặc ""Luôn luôn"" ít nhất là 4 trong 7 tiêu chí thì có thể là bạn bị nghiện việc. • Bạn nghĩ cách để có thể có được nhiều thời gian hơn cho công việc. • Bạn bỏ nhiều thời gian làm việc hơn hơn dự kiến ban đầu. • Bạn làm việc để giảm cảm giác mình có lỗi, lo lắng, không được giúp đỡ và suy nhược. • Bạn không nghe khi bạn bè bảo bạn làm việc ít đi. • Bạn thấy căng thẳng nếu bạn bị cấm làm việc. • Bạn bỏ ưu tiên cho các thú riêng, các hoạt động khi nhàn rỗi và thể dục vì bận việc. • Bạn làm việc nhiều đến mức sức khỏe bị ảnh hưởng xấu.

""Nghiện việc không tính bằng giờ. Nó được xác định bằng điều đã xảy ra bên trong chúng ta,"" ông nói.

""Một người nghiện việc là một người trong khi đang trượt tuyết thì mơ quay trở về để làm việc. Một người làm việc lành mạnh là người khi đang làm thì mơ đi trượt tuyết.""

Robinson (là người đưa lời khuyên cho những người đã ly dị, bị thôi việc hoặc bị khủng hoảng sức khỏe do làm việc quá mức) nhớ lại một khách hàng nói rằng bà nói với chồng rằng mình đã đi tập ở phòng gym, nhưng thực tế là bà đi làm, trước đó bà đã mặc quần áo thể thao và làm cho ướt người để trông giống như toát mồ hôi.

Có giống như ai đó mà bạn biết không?

Nhưng những người nghiện việc không tất yếu tạo ra kết quả tốt nhất hoặc gắn bó hơn ở cơ quan so với đồng nghiệp, sự phân tích toàn diện của trường Đại học Georgia phát hiện như vậy.

Malissa A Clark, một giáo sư trợ giảng về tâm lý của Đại học Georgia, chỉ đạo nghiên cứu này. Bà nói những người nghiện việc bị căng thẳng hơn và kém hài lòng hơn trong công việc, kém hài lòng hơn trong cuộc sống và bỏ nhiều công sức hơn.

Họ cũng bị xung đột lớn hơn trong quan hệ công việc và cuộc sống, sức khỏe thể lực và tinh thần kém hơn và dẫn đến kết cục bất lợi cho gia đình, như rắc rối trong hôn nhân.

""Ít có những kết cục tốt,"" bà nói, mặc dù quan niệm của nghiện việc thường liên quan với những đặc điểm như gắn bó với việc, cạnh tranh, ham muốn và có năng suất tốt.

Bạn có nghĩ rằng bạn có vấn đề không? Có một số tiêu chí tự đánh giá để thử.

Các nhà nghiên cứu Na Uy có thiết lập thang đo mức nghiện việc Bergen để bạn đo cách hành xử, cảm giác và thái độ của bạn đối với công việc. Chương trình Workaholics Anonymous cũng có các câu hỏi trên mạng giúp bạn xác định nếu bạn cần.

Bước đầu tiên, chuyên gia nói, là cứ thừa nhận rằng bạn có vấn đề.

Bản quyền hình ảnh Getty Images Image caption Vì bạn không thể từ bỏ nó một cách đột ngột, bạn phải có kế hoạch giải quyết cách thức làm việc của mình

Đối với Robinson (tự cho mình là người mới khỏi nghiện việc) thì việc điều trị gồm sự quan tâm, điều trị, thay đổi cách cư xử và bộc lộ các vấn đề nằm dưới. ""Nó có những nguyên nhân sâu xa. Đôi khi đó là thể diện, đôi khi đó là một cách để điều chỉnh mối lo lắng,"" ông nói.

Đối với Bob, 61 tuổi, ở California, ông đã thừa nhận là có vấn đề khi vợ ông nói với ông là bà không chịu nổi khi nửa đêm thức giấc và thấy ông không ở nhà, vẫn còn ở cơ quan. Bob (người không nêu tên họ để đảm bảo việc ẩn danh của chương trình Workaholics Anonymous) hiện là nhân viên biệt phái cho chương trình này, làm tự nguyện.

""Thuốc cho người nghiện việc là adrenaline,"" ông nói. ""Sự căng thẳng, áp lực, khủng hoảng, hạn phải xong việc, tất cả những thứ này cho phép năng lực có thêm adrenaline để hoạt động với nhịp độ điên cuồng.""

Bob có công việc đầu tiên khi 5 tuổi, đó là giúp anh đưa báo, tái chế lon đồ uống và chai lọ, cắt cỏ và xúc tuyết. Ông đã trở thành một doanh nhân thành công, nhưng cuối cùng thì sức khỏe giảm sút, và nếu ông không tìm sự hỗ trợ thì cuộc sống gia đình cũng sẽ tồi tệ, ông nói. Vợ ông đã không chịu đựng nổi.

""Việc vợ ông không còn muốn sống như thế nữa đã làm ông sẵn sàng để cuối cùng theo đuổi chương trình này một cách tận tâm và tin tưởng,"" Bob nói.

Nhưng công việc, cũng như thức ăn, không phải là cái mà ta có thể từ bỏ nó một cách đột ngột. Vậy làm thế nào có thể kiểm soát sự thôi thúc làm việc không ngừng? ""Đó là phải có kế hoạch và làm theo kế hoạch thay vì lao một cách ép buộc vào bất cứ công việc gì xuất hiện,"" Bob nói. Nghĩa là việc nào giờ đó, nếu có việc gì đột xuất, thay vì cố dồn ép và làm nhiều việc một cách hỗn loạn, hãy lập lại danh sách việc và xếp hạng ưu tiên lại.

Bản quyền hình ảnh Getty Images Image caption Bạn không nghe khi bạn bè bảo bạn làm việc ít đi?

Những lựa chọn khác là tìm gặp một bác sỹ điều trị giỏi trong lĩnh vực này. Hoặc bạn có thể tham dự các hội thảo và chương trình của bệnh nhân ngoại trú, thí dụ như của The Bridge To Recovery ở Ohio, Mỹ, hỗ trợ cho những người nghiện việc kèm các cách điều trị cho trạng thái cưỡng bức ép buộc, lo sợ và suy sụp.

Nhưng yếu tố lớn nhất trong việc thiếu cách điều trị hiệu lực sẵn có, Clark nói, là việc thiếu nghiên cứu. ""Hiện chưa có nhiều nghiên cứu về sự phát triển của nghiện việc và gần như không có nghiên cứu về mối liên quan giữa nghiện việc và những rối loạn bệnh lý."" Nghiên cứu của Na Uy là một trong những nghiên cứu đầu.

Cần có thêm nhiều nghiên cứu, bà nói. ""để nghiện việc trở thành một môn chính thống hơn là một từ thông dụng ngoài lề nói chơi của quần chúng. Nó đang có những kết cục có hại chính thức đến cuộc sống và hạnh phúc của con người.""

In pictures: Detroit's abandoned buildings,,,2011-05-13 12:58:48,"According to the latest US census, Detroit has lost a quarter of its population in the past 10 years. The decline has left many buildings, like the Woodward Avenue Presbyterian Church seen here, derelict. Here is a rare look inside some of the city's abandoned landmarks. All images provided by buildingsofdetroit.com.

More than 50,000 students passed through the doors of Cass Tech High School before it closed. Among its notable pupils were singer Diana Ross, carmaker John DeLorean, and former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick.

Clark Gable was the first person to appear on the screen of the 2,500-seat Eastown Theatre when it opened in 1931. It later became a concert venue with The Who, the Kinks, Yes, and Cream among others playing there. In the 1990s it became a venue for raves, before being taken over by a church group, and finally abandoned.

Opened in 1927, the luxurious Lee Plaza residential hotel offered a ""complete home life with all the detailed service of a great hotel added"" according to a 1931 brochure. It later housed Detroit pensioners, before closing in 1997.

The waiting room in Michigan Central Station is almost 100ft wide and 230ft long, with 14 marble pillars. During the 1940s, more than 4,000 people a day would cram into this cavernous space. Among those who arrived there were Presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin D Roosevelt, Charlie Chaplin and inventor Thomas Edison.

Originally a venue for jazz and big bands when it opened in 1928, the Grande Ballroom later became famous as a rock venue in the city. Among those that performed on its stage were Pink Floyd, Chuck Berry and the Velvet Underground. It closed in 1972 and has stood empty ever since.

Opening in 1900, the turreted Grand Army of the Republic building was built as a social spot for veterans of America's Civil War. It was later used for meetings of everyone from Alcoholics Anonymous to dance troupes. Suggestions of what to do with it have included bed and breakfast accommodation, offices and luxury flats.

Originally an ornate theatre and cinema - the lobby alone had marble archways and large crystal chandeliers - the Michigan Theatre showed its final movie in 1971, before becoming a rock venue, and finally a car park.
