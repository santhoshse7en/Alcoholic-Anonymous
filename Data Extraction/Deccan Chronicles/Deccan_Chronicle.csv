Alcoholics Anonymous: The helping hand for addicts,,[],2016-05-03 03:24:00,"What begins as social drinking turns into alcoholism for many, but there are many who want to come out of it.

Bengaluru: Sitting at one of the quiet corners of Stracey Memorial High School, a group of about thirty addicts gather late in the evenings to discuss one of the most debilitating issues of all ---alcoholism. What begins as social drinking turns into alcoholism for many, but there are many who want to come out of it.

""I was the General Manager at a company until alcoholism gripped me and I was forced to leave the job,"" says 46-year-old Gnaneswar, who has not touched any alcohol for the past six years. ""I haven't even taken a sip of beer in the last 6 years as I am completely out of it,"" says Gnaneswar, who is an active member of Alcoholics Anonymous, Bangalore and helps other alcoholics get rid of this problem.

This group is not a rehabilitation centre or an NGO, but just a fellowship of men and women who share their experiences, strength and hope with each other, so that they may solve their common problem and help others recover from alcoholism too. At the age of forty, Gnaneshwar became an alcoholic and was told to leave the house many times.

""For me back then alcohol was a religion and I would even lie to get things done my way. I would do it for money as well. All I cared about was drinking,"" says Gnaneswar. His addiction cost him his job, his family and his friends. ""I still remember the day when I was hospitalized and my father asked me to leave the house as he’d had enough. On the third day, a few people from this group met me and the rest is history!""

But he is not alone in the journey to get rid of this addiction. ""There are people who have not touched alcohol for thirty years and they help one another. But the first step is acceptance. “Only if the alcoholic accepts his condition will we include him into the group, where we don't charge anyone a single penny.""

There are 72 centres across the city, which conduct sessions from 7 pm to 8 pm and each centre witnesses around 30 to 40 alcoholics. ""We have teenagers and senior citizens attending our sessions,"" says Gnaneswar. Every single alcoholic who has fully recovered tries to reach out to others as well.","['alcoholism', 'touched', 'addicts', 'gnaneswar', 'leave', 'group', 'turns', 'helping', 'alcoholic', 'drinking', 'alcoholics', 'anonymous', 'alcohol', 'hand']","What begins as social drinking turns into alcoholism for many, but there are many who want to come out of it.

"AA reaches out to schools now, rural men in TN drink more",,[],2018-08-01 06:15:00,"Thanjavur: It will be startling to note that the age where someone gets their first taste of alcohol has reduced drastically over the past 12 years in India from 21 to 18 and is now at 13. This is no doubt a matter of concern. Coordinators of ‘Alcoholic Anonymous’, a support group to help people to come out of their drinking problem, said that AA is now holding public awareness meetings in schools also besides colleges because of of this startling report.

AA has even been suggested by courts as co-therapy or follow up counseling. AA is an International fellowship of men and women who have once had a drinking problem. It is a non-professional, self-supporting, non denominational, apolitical and available almost everywhere. Membership is open to anyone who wants to do something about his or her drinking problem.

As per statistics of union health ministry, Telangana stands at top among southern states when it comes to consumption of alcohol. 53.9 per cent of men and 8.8 per cent of women across Telangana consume alcohol. Consumption is higher in rural areas than in towns and cities.

Consumption of alcohol is also high in Tamil Nadu. In rural areas 47.4 per cent of men consume alcohol and in urban areas 46 per cent of men consume alcohol. With respect to women consumption is less with 0,5 per cent in urban areas and 0.3 per cent in rural areas. (In agitations against Tasmac, women are in the forefront in Tamil Nadu). Consumption of alcohol is the lowest in Kerala among southern states. 40.8 per cent of men consume alcohol in urban areas in Kerala and 32.8 per cent in rural areas according to ministry's statistics.","['schools', 'drink', 'areas', 'women', 'cent', 'aa', 'drinking', 'alcohol', 'tn', 'rural', 'reaches', 'men', 'consume', 'consumption', 'urban']","53.9 per cent of men and 8.8 per cent of women across Telangana consume alcohol.

"The chat room: ‘Not prohibition, rehab is the answer to alcoholism’",,[],2016-05-22 05:53:00,"Last week, Samrat Chadha, one of the head honchos at the UB Group, drove his BMW into an autorickshaw, injuring three people. After hours of negotiation with the police, he was made to take an alcometer test, which proved positive. With drunken driving incidents like these on the rise - a number of them fatal - and more and more states taking to the idea of prohibition, is it time for Karnataka to follow suit?

A counsellor for rehab inmates and long-time member of Alcoholics Anonymous rubbished the idea at once. Suresh (name changed) chose to remain anonymous, in keeping with the group's policy, but said, ""That's quite stupid. The state would lose out on a lot of revenue. And the bottom line is that it would only hit the poor man. The rich, like Samrat Chadha, will not be affected by it at all. They know how to procure alcohol and can afford to pay for it.""

Chadha, he said, exhibits definite signs of a drinking problem — ""He doesn't know his limits, clearly. This is the second stage of the disease, when the alcoholic begins blacking out. When they are under the influence, they have no idea what they are doing, lose their sense of judgment and don't remember it the next day.""

Today's lifestyle, Suresh explained, has a big role to play in these incidents. Drinking is now a celebrated part of our culture and is an almost inextricable part of meeting ""social commitments."" It's up to the individual, he explained, to know his limits. The effects, of course, are mostly visible among the wealthier sections of society - ""A man who doesn't own a car will end up in a brawl on the streets or at home. The principle is the same, though. You don't know what you're doing and the next day, you're wondering what on earth happened.""

Not everybody who drinks has a problem, of course and Alcoholics Anonymous has stats at the ready to back this. ""Out of a 100 people who drink, 10 are problem drinkers,"" Suresh said. ""Out of those ten, three will turn into alcoholics."" And it's unfair to blame the condition on anybody else, he added. ""The blame game can go on and on - your boss fired you, so you drink. Your wife didn't listen to you, so guess what - you drank! Every alcoholic has a thousand excuses to have a drink and it's upto him to come to terms with it.""

Still, the fact that money is easy to come by these days has played a major role in the drinking culture we see today. ""Everyone can afford to go out for a drink - or three. It's a part of office life as well - corporate companies need to spread awareness among their employees. Alcohol is a fashion statement.""

The onus cannot be lifted entirely from the government, even if prohibition is not the answer - ""I might be an A.A. member, but that doesn't mean I'm against drinking,"" Suresh remarked, with a laugh. ""Still, the government can spread awareness and work with groups like A.A. - who will help for free, by the way. We need more stringent rules in place."" Getting caught for driving drunk means a fine, yes, but that's the end of that and it simply won't do.

""Every time a case of drunken driving or domestic abuse brought on by alcohol is reported in the station, cops should know what to do. Sending people to rehab or to A.A. meetings for a stipulated time period should become part of the system. That's how things are done in the West and it works very well. But we, as a society, don't understand the meaning or the implications of alcoholism."" Far from recommending an A.A. meeting to a repeat offender, cops, he said, respond with, ""Did the wine shop invite these people to drink'? That's the kind of reaction we get, even though we don't charge any money for what we do.""

Very little government funding goes into long term plans, Suresh added. ""You have departments like the Welfare Board, which don't do anything. They're just a farce and completely politically motivated. If a little bit of the money allocated to them was put to the use for which it was intended, society would come a long way.”","['alcoholism', 'thats', 'chat', 'money', 'drink', 'dont', 'answer', 'know', 'aa', 'drinking', 'rehab', 'suresh', 'society', 'problem', 'prohibition', 'room']","Chadha, he said, exhibits definite signs of a drinking problem — ""He doesn't know his limits, clearly.

Pooja Bhatt will write on her struggle with alcoholism in tell-all book,,[],2018-03-16 00:07:00,"Filmmaker and former actress Pooja Bhatt is on a new journey — that to quit alcohol. By her own admission, she had been addicted earlier, but has been sober for a while now. She even spoke extensively about her struggle with alcoholism a few months ago.

Now, Pooja, who is a success story in herself, will soon be releasing her book, which will speak about her battle with alcohol, but she has clearly stated that this isn’t her autobiography.

Adds a source, “The book, which has still not been titled, will widely speak about her journey through drinking and alcoholism. While Pooja and her father have never been to rehab to quit alcohol, they’ve frequently been spotted at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, trying to talk to people on how to kick the bottle.”

Mahesh Bhatt famously quit drinking, after finding dirt on his face on a then-Bombay pavement 28 years ago, and Pooja quit drinking 14 months ago. She even took to Twitter to share the news of her having completed 445 days of sobriety.

“Thank you Lord for the courage to say NO and for the capacity to be able to start all over again if necessary. 445 days sober today & counting. Gratitude for the resilience and strength bestowed with every new step I take! #sobriety #recovery #claimyourjourney (sic),” she wrote.

Goa Minister Ramesh Tawadkar plans ‘cure’ units for LGBTs,,[],2015-01-13 13:30:00,"Panaji: Goa’s sports and youth affairs minister Ramesh Tawadkar on Monday said the government was planning to set up centres to administer treatment to the LGBT youths to make them “normal”.

Like Alcoholic Anonymous, we will have centres. We will train them and give them medicines too,” he said. The policy lists LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans-gender) community among the stigmatised groups that need attention.

“A detailed survey would be carried out on the LGBT community so that their problems could be addressed,” he added.

The BJP refused to comment on the statement. “I am not aware of the statement and in what context he made it,” said Goa BJP spokesperson Dr Wilfred Mesquita.

Got 'Drunchies'? That's why you're packing on the pounds,,[],2018-08-09 15:20:00,"If a person drinks five beers, it accounts for third of their daily energy intake. (Representational Image)

Drunchies, or the desire to eat salty, unhealthy foods after a night of heavy drinking, may be contributing to the obesity epidemic among college students, scientists say.

Researchers from University at Buffalo in the US decided to look at a sample of 286 college students to better understand how drinking affects what they eat, both that night and for their first meal the next day when, most likely, they are hungover.

""Given the obesity epidemic and the rates of alcohol consumption on college campuses, we need to be aware of not only the negative effect of alcohol consumption, but also the impact it has on what people are eating while they are drinking,"" said Jessica Kruger, an assistant professor at the University at Buffalo.

Research on the effects of drinking and diet is scarce, Kruger said, adding that eating more unhealthy foods following alcohol consumption is an often overlooked behaviour in traditional addiction research.

The inspiration for the study, published in the Californian Journal of Health Promotion, came from an ad researchers saw in a university newspaper.

""It said, 'Got Drunchies?' and had ads for pizza, tacos, and other fast-food places that were open late after the bars closed,"" Kruger said.

An average beer contains 150 calories. If a person drinks five beers, it accounts for third of their daily energy intake. Add two slices of pizza or a burrito to that at the end of the night, and it's a recipe for weight gain, she said.

""So, we dug a bit deeper and first figured out what the 'drunchies' were, and then decided this would be interesting to study,"" Kruger said.

Study participants were asked to complete an anonymous online survey.

Researchers found that drinking influenced study participants' dietary behaviours before going to bed.

All alcohol drinkers were more likely to eat something before they went to bed after drinking alcohol than in general before they go to bed.

Specifically, they were more likely to opt for salty snack foods and pizza. Healthy foods, such as dark green vegetables and other veggies they would ordinarily eat, were not as appealing.

Of particular concern, the researchers noted, was the fact that participants did not report drinking more water or other non-alcoholic beverages before bed.

That exacerbates dehydration, which may lead to additionally unhealthy food choices.

The following day after drinking, participants' dietary patterns varied from the night before. They were less likely to skip meals the morning after a night of drinking compared to a typical morning.

They favoured foods like pizza or tacos over milk and dairy products and grains, most likely because of the so-called hangover cures that get passed down to students and which entail eating foods that ""soak up"" the alcohol.

Dispelling these myths is one way to promote a healthy diet even after a night of binge drinking, Kruger said.","['thats', 'night', 'likely', 'pizza', 'participants', 'eat', 'youre', 'drinking', 'kruger', 'alcohol', 'foods', 'pounds', 'packing', 'university', 'drunchies']","and had ads for pizza, tacos, and other fast-food places that were open late after the bars closed,"" Kruger said.

UN chief Ban Ki-moon accuses India of intolerance with gay sex ban,,[],2015-01-13 16:57:00,"U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon addresses the media during his visit to the Sabarmati Ashram, from where Mahatma Gandhi had launched several anti-British movements, in Ahmadabad, India, Sunday, Jan. 11, 2015. Ban is in the country on a four-day

New Delhi: United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon has accused India of fomenting intolerance with its ban on gay sex amid uproar over a ruling party minister's plans to make homosexuals ""normal"".

Speaking on a visit to New Delhi, Ban said he ""staunchly opposed the criminalisation of homosexuality"" referring to India's colonial-era law that prohibits gay sex.

""I am proud to stand for the equality of all people -- including those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender,"" the UN secretary general said in a statement late Monday.

""I speak out because laws criminalising consensual, adult same-sex relationships violate basic rights to privacy and to freedom from discrimination. Even if they are not enforced, these laws breed intolerance.""

India's Supreme Court re-imposed a ban on gay sex in late 2013, ruling that the responsibility for changing the 1861 law rested with lawmakers and not judges.

Gay sex had been effectively legalised in 2009 when the Delhi High Court ruled that banning ""carnal intercourse against the order of nature"" was a violation of fundamental rights.

Ban's comments came on the same day that a state minister from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party announced his plans to make gays ""normal"" in the coastal resort state of Goa.

Ramesh Tawadkar, sports and youth affairs minister in Goa's state government, told reporters that he planned to open up centres on the lines of Alcoholics Anonymous to treat them.

""We will make them normal. We will have centres for them, like Alcoholic Anonymous centres,"" Tawadkar said, adding that the state would ""train them and give them medicines too"".

Tawadkar, a member of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), made the comments after releasing the state's policy on youth issues which listed lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders as a stigmatised group that needed attention.

His comments drew widespread criticism and ridicule from gay rights groups and social media with jeering remarks posted on Twitter.

Problem drinking starts before military deployment,,[],2016-05-08 11:57:00,"Just under 39 percent of the sailors and marines reported hazardous drinking before deployment, a study says. (Photo: Pixabay)

Binge drinking and alcoholism is a big issue in the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, and the problem may begin even before sailors and marines deploy, a recent study suggests.

More than a quarter of sailors and marines who were anonymously surveyed within two weeks before their deployment admitted to binge drinking regularly, and nearly 40 percent reported dangerous drinking. A small but significant number also reported that they had been drugged against their will.

Previous research has focused on the drinking habits of military personnel while deployed or after returning home. Little is known about drinking in the period before reporting for duty, the researchers write in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

That period could be a time of higher stress and people may drink more because they will not be able to drink while aboard ship, the researchers write. “This is a time of major transition away from family, friends and important social support networks,” said coauthor Dr. Braden Hale, program manager at the Department of Defense’s HIV/AIDS Prevention Program.

Hale told Reuters Health by email that screening for alcohol abuse before deployment could allow people to be identified and helped earlier. The study team used data on 2,351 male and female shipboard personnel collected between 2012 and 2014.

Participants gave anonymous reports about hazardous drinking, including how often they drank and how often they had more than six drinks at a time. They also answered questions about alcohol dependency, including physical cravings for it, and binge drinking, defined as having more than four drinks for women and more than five for men during a typical day of drinking.

The researchers also asked if participants had ever been “roofied,” or had their drinks spiked. Overall, 79 percent of the subjects were men and around 85 percent were in the Navy. Just over 12 percent were under the age of 21.

Just under 39 percent of the sailors and marines reported hazardous drinking before deployment. This was significantly higher for men, at 40 percent, than for women, at 34 percent. Thirty-six percent of those under age 21 had engaged in hazardous drinking.

Twenty-seven percent reported binge drinking. This too was more common for men, at nearly 30 percent, than for women, at 20 percent. Overall, close to 15 percent were dependent on alcohol: nearly 17 percent of men and 7 percent of women. Personnel between the ages of 17 and 20 were more likely to report being dependent on alcohol.

Few of the sailors and marines reported taking recreational drugs, but 7 percent had been given a drug against their will. The percentages were about equal between men and women.

“These findings confirm there is a culture of drinking, including underage drinking, among Marines and Navy members that needs to be addressed,” said Mary Jo Larson, a senior scientist at Brandeis University’s Institute for Behavioral Health who studies military drinking.

“The consequences include injuries, fights, car crashes and unwanted sexual contact, including rape,” said Larson, who was not involved in the study.

Larson noted that commanding officers are notified when service members seek treatment for drinking, which may discourage people who need help from seeking it.

“The take away is that the Navy and Marines must establish additional effective prevention programs, which send a strong message that those that need medical help can receive it confidentially,” she said by email.

In order to prevent short- and long-term harms from alcohol abuse, Hale calls for “screening, intervention and care before deployment for shipboard personnel who may be engaging in hazardous or dependent alcohol use.”","['starts', 'marines', 'military', 'deployment', 'women', 'drinking', 'alcohol', 'personnel', 'problem', 'men', 'sailors', 'reported', 'hazardous']","Just under 39 percent of the sailors and marines reported hazardous drinking before deployment, a study says.

Pregnant woman who drink could be charged with ‘crime of violence’,,[],2014-11-27 17:20:00,"London: A British court is to rule on whether a woman committed a ""crime of violence"" against her child by drinking heavily during pregnancy, in a case that has raised concerns about criminalizing mothers.



A local authority is applying to the government's criminal compensation authority for damages on behalf of a seven-year-old girl in its care who has severe alcohol-related disabilities.



Its lawyers have told the Court of Appeal that her mother was ""reckless"" in her behaviour by drinking up to half a bottle of vodka and eight cans of strong lager a day while she was pregnant.



While they do not suggest the damage was deliberate, they say she discussed her drinking with professionals and ""went on to take the risk"".



The case, in which a ruling is expected next week, has sparked heated debate over the dangers of alcohol and the rights of women and foetuses in a country where abortion has been legal since 1967.



Women's rights groups have warned that it risks opening the door to police action against pregnant women as is increasingly happening in the United States.



""The case is of profound social significance,"" said the British Pregnancy Advisory Service and Birthrights charities.



""If the court were to interpret the law as requested by the council, it would establish a legal precedent which could be used to prosecute women who drink while pregnant.""



However, some commentators say it is a no-brainer.



""What about the rights of the little girl in this case whose life is forever blighted because of what her mother did?"" wrote one furious writer in the Daily Mirror tabloid.



80 cases waiting in the wings



The Court of Appeal judgement will cap a five-year legal battle between the council and the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA).



CICA considers applications for damages involving behaviour that could constitute a crime, in this case the alleged reckless administration of a noxious substance to the foetus.



In the latest stage of the proceedings in December, a judge ruled in CICA's favour and said the foetus was not a person until birth and could not be a victim of crime.



This ruling is now being appealed, with 80 similar claims for compensation waiting on the outcome.



Neil Sugarman, one of the plaintiff's lawyers, denies the case could move Britain closer to prosecuting pregnant women.



""We are not for a minute suggesting that will or ought to happen here,"" he told AFP.



But he acknowledged the whole issue was ""fraught"" with complications, not least because drinking alcohol in itself is not a crime.



""Would it have been different if a woman had said she'd decided to take tonnes of salt and the salt had damaged the child?"" he asked.



'Would I have stopped drinking?'

The girl, known only as CP, has a severe form of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), an umbrella term which covers a range of disorders varying from reduced intellectual ability to heart and kidney problems.



But campaigners say it remains misunderstood and the British government's advice on drinking in pregnancy has been accused of being contradictory.



""No mother drinks intentionally to harm her child,"" said Susie Fleisher, who set up the FASD support group NOFAS-UK after her adopted daughter was diagnosed.



""A woman who has issues with alcohol should have support and not be thrown in prison.""



Linda, a 49-year-old from London, was drinking eight or nine cans of lager a day when she was pregnant with her two eldest children, both in their 20s now.



She had only heard about FASD in passing and says she was offered no support to give up alcohol.



Her first daughter was fine but her second was born with the telltale distorted facial features and now has trouble socializing, controlling her temper and concentrating.



""Telling a mum is not enough. They need to be helped and supported,"" said Linda, who asked to remain anonymous.



She opposes criminalizing pregnant mothers, but acknowledges that some custodial rehabilitation might have helped her.



""I was dependent on alcohol. I needed alcohol. I couldn't get through the day without it.



""Had I been warned of all the potential dangers and then sent home, would I have stopped? Probably not. Not without help.""","['support', 'say', 'drink', 'court', 'violence', 'pregnant', 'women', 'crime', 'rights', 'drinking', 'charged', 'alcohol', 'case', 'woman']","London: A British court is to rule on whether a woman committed a ""crime of violence"" against her child by drinking heavily during pregnancy, in a case that has raised concerns about criminalizing mothers.

"LGBT remark: Goa minister does U-turn, CM says colleague ignorant",,[],2015-01-13 22:07:00,"Panaji: With his remarks on medical treatment to the LGBT community creating a storm, Goa minister Ramesh Tawadkar made a U-turn on Tuesday saying he was ""misquoted"" while Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar sought to pour oil on troubled waters calling his colleague ""ignorant"".

""I was misunderstood and misquoted. I was not talking about the LGBT (youths) but about drug addicted and sexually abused youths,"" Tawadkar said as even TV news channels continued to air the footage wherein he was shown assuring medical treatment for LGBT youths to make them ""normal"".

""We will make them normal. We will have a centre for them. Like Alcoholic Anonymous centres, we will have centres. We will train them and give them medicines too,"" Tawadkar, Minister for Sports and Youth Affairs, had said on Monday while announcing the state's policy for the youth.

As Tawadkar's remarks drew flak from the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, Chief Minister Parsekar attempted to calm things down, saying the minister must have been ignorant about the issue and that their sexual preferences were ""natural"".

""He must be ignorant about the issue. They (LGBT) are natural. They don't need any treatment,"" Parsekar said.

He said the minister had himself clarified the matter and that ""there is no controversy"".

""Youth policy speaks about drug addicted youths and sexually abused youths as a focused group. There are provisions in the central government sponsored Social Justice Scheme for such youths which can be implemented in Goa,"" Tawadkar said.

He said when journalists asked him about LGBTs, ""I told them I am not expert on the issue.""

Though the minister today refused to acknowledge LGBT as a focused group, the youth policy document, already in the public domain, has mentioned them as one.

""Like in the case of other target groups such as juvenile offenders, drug afflicted youth, marginalised or migrant youth, geographically disadvantaged youth, a detailed survey would be carried out among state LGBT community, so that their problems could be specifically addressed,"" he had said on Monday.

On a day the Goa minister's comments on sexual preferences generated controversy, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon had opposed criminalising homosexuality, saying it breeds intolerance by violating basic rights to privacy and freedom.

""I staunchly oppose criminalisation of homosexuality. They violate the basic rights to privacy and freedom. These laws breed intolerance.

Campaign launched to 'understand' dating problems Indian women face,,[],2015-06-28 18:21:00,"New Delhi : In a bid to empower single Indian females looking for a serious relationship, to find the right partner, the first women centric app Matchify has launched a successful campaign to understand the challenges that women face while dating men.

The leg of this series dubbed #HasThisHappenedToYou, launched on Twitter, drew over 5,000 interesting responses from women.

Matchify, which has 2,50,000 downloads, understands that women experience too many things in the digital space especially from strangers, which obviously makes them uncomfortable. The campaign is an attempt to get women to open up about it and let the world know about their concerns.

Kaushik Tiwari, Head of Marketing, Matrimony.com which incubated Matchify, said that it turned out to be very interesting in understanding what women of today face and how they react to different situations in their life when dating men.

He added that Matchify app is women-centric and hence, understanding the problems and challenges a woman faces is of utmost importance at all times to enable us to provide safe and reliable options.

Sai Chithra, Business Head, said that some of the cool women-centric features of Matchify are 'Anonymous chat' that actually helps women initiate a chat in ""Mask me"" mode where the photo and complete profile details are kept anonymous. Only when they are comfortable, they can choose to reveal the identity.

However, as a product feature, women can initiate a chat directly with anyone (either anonymous or normal) while men can initiate a chat only in case of mutual like, added Chithra.

Chithra noted that the other feature 'React' helps women know if the profile picture uploaded is genuine or not by letting women ask men to upload instant ""selfies"" while on a chat.","['launched', 'womencentric', 'indian', 'chat', 'react', 'dating', 'campaign', 'matchify', 'problems', 'profile', 'women', 'understanding', 'anonymous', 'initiate', 'face', 'men', 'understand']","New Delhi : In a bid to empower single Indian females looking for a serious relationship, to find the right partner, the first women centric app Matchify has launched a successful campaign to understand the challenges that women face while dating men.

Binge drinking dramatically ups mortality rate,,[],2015-04-30 00:37:00,"Hangovers are inevitable when it comes to New Year celebrations, here's how you can banish them.

Washington: A new study has provided a link between drinking behaviors with the overall mortality rate.

A new University of Colorado Boulder study involving some 40,000 people indicates that social and psychological problems caused by drinking generally trump physically hazardous drinking behaviors when it comes to overall mortality rates.

The study showed, for instance, that participants who had experienced an intervention by physicians, family members or friends had a 67 percent greater risk of death over the 18-year study period, said sociology Professor Richard Rogers, lead study author. Those who reported cutting down on social or sports activities because of alcohol use had a 46 percent higher risk of death over the same period.

In contrast, issues like driving after drinking too much or engaging in other physically risky behaviors did not result in a significant uptick in mortality rates.

The new study also showed social risks of drinking, from losing jobs to having spouses threaten to leave, were equally or more strongly linked to mortality than physiological consequences of alcohol abuse like withdrawal jitters or becoming physically ill.

One of the most unexpected findings was that of those who identified themselves as light drinkers, consuming less than one drink a day, 48 percent reported having some problem with alcohol in the 12 months prior to the survey.

The research data allowed the CU-Boulder team to investigate the mortality associated with 41 separate drinking problems including drinking more than intended, unsuccessfully trying to cut back, driving a car after drinking too much, losing ties with friends and family, missing work with hangovers, drinking more to get the same effect, depression and arrests.

It was also found that 23 percent started drinking without intending to, 20 percent drank longer than expected and 25 percent experienced a strong urge to drink. For those who experienced a strong urge to drink over the past year, 19 percent were light drinkers, 40 percent were moderate drinkers and 57 percent were heavy drinkers.

Current drinkers who found it difficult to stop once they started had a 15 percent higher risk of death over the follow-up period; those who acknowledged going on a drinking bender during the past 12 months had a 54 percent higher mortality rate; and those who blacked out during the previous 12 months prior to the assessment had a 22 percent higher mortality rate over the 18-year study period.

The new study also showed those who reported attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in the past year had a 45 percent higher risk of mortality.

But those results likely are somewhat misleading in that some of those people could have recently have been diagnosed as alcoholics or were more likely to have severe health, social or legal problems, including required AA attendance. In addition, those who reported attending AA might have had increased risk of mortality due to smoking or may have had other substance abuse problems.

"Alcohol, substance abuse can lead to poor lifestyle choices",,[],2019-04-16 16:33:00,"College students, if subjected to even one negative habits such as heavy drinking or substance abuse, can end up living a life of mental distress, lack of sleep, low grades and poor lifestyle choices. (Photo: Representational/Pixabay)

Washington: A new study has claimed that college students, if subjected to even one among negative habits such as heavy drinking or substance abuse, can end up living a life of mental distress, lack of sleep, low grades and poor lifestyle choices.

""We used a robust data-mining technique to identify associations between mental distress in college students with substance abuse, sleep, social behaviours, academic attitude and behaviours, and GPA (short-term and long-term as reflective of academic performance),"" said Lina Begdache, an Assistant Professor at the Binghamton University, where the research was conducted.

""Positive behaviours such as abstinence from substance use, studious attitudes and responsibility toward work and family are reflective of a brain chemistry profile that supports mood and maturation of the prefrontal cortex of the brain. The latter matures last and supports impulse and emotional control as well as rationalization of thoughts,” she added.

In this study, which was published in Trends in Neuroscience and Education, a total of 558 students were asked to complete an anonymous survey on academic performance, daytime sleepiness, substance use, and mental distress.

Low mental distress in college students was associated with no substance abuse, responsible attitude towards learning as well as good academic efforts, high GPA (of above 3.0) and limited daytime sleepiness.

Mild mental distress correlated with borderline work neglect and with a marginal negative association with grade-point average.

Severe mental distress correlated with substance abuse (including excessive alcohol drinking), extreme daytime sleepiness, poor academic attitude, and low GPA.

The results demonstrate that manageable lifestyle factors contribute to mental health in college students, which become potentially cyclic events that may impact academic performance.

""These factors that are associated with mental distress in college students are controllable factors, meaning that proper education of students may reduce risk of mental distress on college campuses, which is on the rise,"" said Begdache.

She went on to say that it is important for young adults to recognise that one behaviour may lead to a domino effect. ""For instance, using drugs recreationally, abusing alcohol or using 'study' drugs not only affects brain chemistry but may affect diet and sleep, which may further alter brain function and brain maturity.”

“When young adults follow a healthy lifestyle (diet, sleep, and exercise), they are more likely to avoid drugs and alcohol, which supports a normal brain maturity, which is then reflected in a higher GPA and responsible attitudes toward learning, work and family, "" added Begdache.","['substance', 'students', 'abuse', 'choices', 'college', 'lead', 'brain', 'distress', 'poor', 'alcohol', 'academic', 'lifestyle', 'sleep', 'mental']","College students, if subjected to even one negative habits such as heavy drinking or substance abuse, can end up living a life of mental distress, lack of sleep, low grades and poor lifestyle choices.

A bad case of Viral,,[],2017-03-15 00:12:00,"The Viral Fever — or TVF — a trailblazer in the world of web series, found itself in the midst of a murky controversy on Monday. An anonymous author with the blog name Indian Fowler, accused TVF’s founder, Arunabh Kumar, of sexual harassment in a post that went viral on the Internet. A supposed ex-employee, she accused Kumar of molestation on various occasions. “Right from Pitchers to Tripling, I was molested. Be it in parties where Arunabh would try to lift me or would try and fall on me pretending he is drunk. One instance was the Ola deal.

The Ola team was meeting him and we were taking notes. He walks out of the meeting with some excuse and calls me for some notes. I walk up. He says its time we do a quicky. I am stunned (sic),” she wrote in a 700-word long post that went on to mention in detail her trauma as a TVF employee.

It went on to cause much outrage in the virtual space, with many viewers condemning the platform, and a few others calling the post a publicity stunt. When contacted, Arunabh chose not to respond to our message. Comedian Vipul Goyal, closely associated with the comedy collective, too, chose not to respond to our questions. Meanwhile, an alleged ex-employee, Aayushi Agarwal, came forward to testify against the channel. When contacted she said, “I worked for TVF for a year and three months and I was harassed by another colleague; it wasn’t Arunabh. Overall my experience was very bad as a woman. I hated working there and had to leave my job hurriedly.” She added, “I reported it to everyone there could be. My case was handled with such stupidity and callousness; nobody paid any heed. And it is only after I threatened to lodge an FIR did they come forward and fired the guy in question.”

As the post continued to be circulated, another young lady called Reema Sengupta, who has worked with TVF in the past came forward to support Indian Fowler’s claims. “I was shooting with him (Arunabh) in the TVF office, for a web series I was directing last year. In the middle of the shoot, he touches my shoulder tattoo and tells me he finds it sexy. After every other shot, he would come over to the monitor to see how the shot looks, but at the same time graze his hand against my waist. Do I wish I had retaliated immediately? Yes. I didn’t because the agency and the client would have both suffered. In hindsight, that was wrong and I’m sure they would’ve supported my decision. But today, I had to choose between keeping quiet and extending my support to a girl who has bravely spoken up. TVF can release as many ‘official responses’ rubbishing these claims as they’d like. This is my truth.”

Later, in an official statement issued by TVF, the collective said, “The article is completely ludicrous and defamatory against TVF and its team. All the allegations made against TVF and its team in the article are categorically false, baseless and unverified. We take a lot of pride in our team and in making TVF a safe workplace that is equally comfortable for women and men. We will leave no stone unturned to find the author of the article and bring them to severe justice for making such false allegations. It is our humble request that you do not share an unsubstantiated, unverified and anonymous article such as this. We would like to thank all our fans and friends for their continued support.”

There are others, however, who don’t want to jump to any conclusion without more concrete proof. City stand-up comic Kunal Kamra, for one, doesn’t believe Arunabh is capable of the allegations levelled against him. “I don’t want to believe anything till the anonymous author doesn’t reveal herself. I know Arunabh. I don’t believe that he is capable of anything like this,” he said.

In the past couple of years, the TVF has brought out several series including the hugely popular Permanent Roommates, Barely Speaking with Arnub, TVF Pitchers, TVF Tripling and Chai Sutta Chronicles among others.","['believe', 'article', 'tvf', 'bad', 'series', 'dont', 'team', 'post', 'arunabh', 'went', 'viral', 'case', 'forward']","The Viral Fever — or TVF — a trailblazer in the world of web series, found itself in the midst of a murky controversy on Monday.

Wine testing drive in Coorg after tourist’s complaint,,[],2015-07-07 10:01:00,"Bengaluru: Plan to enjoy this monsoon at Coorg? Think twice before buying the locally made wine! Based on a complaint lodged by an anonymous tourist from Bengaluru city, Coorg district excise department officials have launched a massive wine-testing drive in the district. The complaint was routed through the district tourism department.

It all started with a city tourist distributing home-made wines brought from Coorg to his friends in the city. According to this anonymous petitioner, immediately after consuming the wine, his friends fell ill. Attributing the cause of illness to the wine, he lodged a complaint with the Coorg tourism department, who in turn forwarded the complaint to the excise department which started a massive inspection drive across the district. Sources say, the reason for the illness was a high alcoholic content.

Confirming the developments, Coorg district Dy Commissioner of Excise Mr. Aziz Ahmed said that the department is trying to find the brand of wine which had the excess alcoholic content. “We are collecting the samples. The petitioner did not give us the exact details of the brand which caused the illness. The state government has fixed a maximum for the alcoholic content in wines. If we find a wine brand which has exceeded the limit for alcohol content, action will be initiated,” he said.

Meanwhile, sources in the state excise department have said that following the incident, locally made wines which do not have primary information such as name of the manufacturer, percentage of alcoholic content, brand name, validity period and manufacturing date are banned from the market.

“Coorg is known for its locally made wines. But the department will not allow a few to take any undue advantage. Our officials have already, banned wine brands which do not provide complete information,” said an officer.

"Healthy X’mas yums Bakey, Beku",,[],2018-12-13 00:06:00,"The mention of Christmas reminds one of all the gifts, decorations, sparkles and yums! About baking cakes, cookies, snacks and chocolates. From the days leading to Christmas to long after, many binge on delicious rose cookies, tassies, kal-kals, logs, marzipan and more that grandmas and mums make from scratch, and today the friendly neighbourhood baker is up for the task. But as yummy as this festive feasting is, all these are high on sugar and fat, leaving many perplexed about how they will curb the urge to gorge away. Sugar, refined flour, butter and chocolate — health buffs are already getting sleepless nights. The city has the perfect answer — This Christmas season, city bakers are are offering healthy goodies using a variety of natural ingredients like honey, jaggery, nut flours, seeds, oats, etc, so you can eat without guilt.

Chaitali Raizada, a city-based baker has two versions of the classic plum cake — the alcoholic and the fruity one (soaked in natural juices). She says, “The dry fruits for the non-alcoholic cake are cooked in fruit rind, juice and jaggery. I don’t trust store-bought flour. For my cakes, I use in-house milled almond flour. For those with a nut allergy, we use oat flour. I also do vegan cakes, and use cooking olive oil.”

City-based baker Trishala Ashok has many goodies being baked in her oven. “Every Christmas, we play Secret Santa and people send anonymous goodie boxes to loved ones. These are low-cal and healthy. This time, I will be making oat chocochip cookies, peanut butter truffles and ragi brownies. I have substituted white or brown sugar with jaggery and honey instead of artificial sweeteners,” says Trishala.

Arati Badgandi, a city-based doctor does not have time to workout, so eating right is very important to her. This festive season, she has opted for low cal goodies to keep a check on what she eats. She adds, “Healthy and low cal is the trend now. I have bought a lot of dark chocolate ragi brownies frosted with peanut butter, oatmeal and strawberry cupcakes. The surprising thing is that even though they are made unconventionally, they are still moist and taste good,” she says.

For Shruthi SA, who is known for her granola bars and chocolates, the agenda is simple, “I make a lot of granola bars, nutcrackers and healthy chocolates. Cinnamon and cloves are spices that are perfect for the festive season. Keeping this in mind, this time, we are making dark chocolate barks. I have used a lot of nuts and seeds and also chia, flax seeds and millet. So if you were to eat a 40 gm granola bar, your calorie intake would be close to 120 cal.”

Nutritionist Dr Aruna Vijay elaborates on this endless tussle about eating yums or going healthy, “It’s definitely going to be low calorie if natural substitutes are used. But it also depends on how they make it low cal. For example, if sugar is substituted with jaggery or honey then it’s definitely welcome. If they are going to use artificial sweeteners then that is a big no-no. We all know how our body reacts to chemicals. People who want to indulge in these low cal goodies should go ahead, and let go of a meal rather than eating it along with their three meals a day. Even the low calorie and healthy snacks should be used in moderation. They can have it for a day, and then go healthy from the next day.”","['bakey', 'healthy', 'jaggery', 'low', 'seeds', 'goodies', 'christmas', 'cal', 'used', 'beku', 'flour', 'yums', 'xmas', 'sugar']","This festive season, she has opted for low cal goodies to keep a check on what she eats.

Cox’s Bazaar: As Rohingya women struggle to access even the very basics such as food and water in Bangladesh’s overcrowded camps, a flourishing sex trade offers cash in times of desperation.

Four women entered the clean-swept mud hut, took off their black shawls and sat cross-legged on the floor. When asked if they sold sex, the women stirred uncomfortably and were silent. Later, after cups of tea, the question came up again.

The women caught each other’s eyes. Slowly one of them walked across the room to shut the door, another blocked the window. Darkness fell in the small, humid hut and voices turned to whispers.

“If anyone finds out what we do, they will kill us,” murmured 26-year-old Romida. More than 600,000 ethnic Rohingya, a Muslim minority in Myanmar, have fled attacks by the Myanmar army since late August, fleeing across to border to southern Bangladesh in the world’s fastest growing refugee crisis. In Kutupalong, the biggest camp, the sex industry is thriving. Many of the sex workers are longer term residents of the Bangladeshi camps, but the influx of tens of thousands more vulnerable women and girls is expected to fuel the trade.

“At least 500 Rohingya prostitutes live in Kutupalong,” said Noor, who works as a fixer, but many have lived for years in the camp which was established in 1992. “Recruiters now have their eyes set on the newcomers,” she added. UN agencies say they have no figures on the numbers of sex workers in the camps to make public.

“It’s hard to come by numbers and we don’t collect data on how many sex workers are in the camps,” Saba Zariv, an expert on gender-based violence at the U.N.’s population agency UNFPA told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

-Rumors-

A recent report from UNICEF, the U.N. children’s fund, UNICEF report said that in the chaotic, unorganised camps, children and youths could fall prey to traffickers and people looking to exploit and manipulate them. From tight-knit conservative Muslim communities, the Rohingya often turn a blind eye to prostitution. “People pretend that it doesn’t exist,” said Noor. “The girls meet their Bangladeshi clients outside the camps. They don’t sleep with other Rohingya. Our communities are tight and rumours could spread easily. Each girl wants to appear pure.”

Many of the prostitutes are children who eat no more than one meal a day and don’t attend school. They work secretively without even their parents knowing. Rena, 18, who has lived in the camp for the past decade was forced to marry an alcoholic two years ago. “He mistreated me and beat me,” she said. Her abusive husband ran and left her when she gave birth to her first son. Feeding her child became impossible.

“That’s when I decided to become a sex worker. I was only 16, but it was out of desperation. I needed money.” Fourteen-year-old Kamru, who also sells sex, arrived years ago in a previous wave of Rohingya refugees. She has never been able to attend school because her family is too poor. “The camp is all I remember. I grew up here, but I was always hungry,” said the teenager, who like all the women and girls did not want to reveal her full name.

Sex workers share common traits: poverty, abusive family members and lack of funds make them vulnerable enough to be trafficked into the camp’s sex industry. “If aid agencies can’t manage to provide people with their basic needs, the risk of trafficking grows – if we can’t establish a sustainable mechanism here and aid tires out, we could see trafficking levels rise,” said Lisa Akero, gender protection specialist at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

-Slipping into Prostitution-

Romida had been left hungry and malnourished and saw prostitution as the only way she could survive. “I told myself I’d do anything. I didn’t have a choice.” Her first client was a Bangladeshi friend who convinced her to have sex with him for 1,000 Taka ($12).

“He paid good money,” she recalled. “The going-rate is 200 ($2.50) and my fixer takes half of it.” The business largely operates by phone calls, with pimps informing the girls where to go and who to see. On average, Romida has three male clients a week – and daren’t risk taking on more for fear of being found out. “I sometimes travel as far as Cox’s Bazar city, which is a two hour drive. Whenever I leave the camp, I have to make up excuses. I pretend to be visiting relatives or taking a shift at the market.”

The Rohingya women meet men of all backgrounds – from university students to local politicians. In a brief phone conversation, Ali, a 23-year-old Bangladeshi student told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that he sleeps with prostitutes occasionally, but when he eventually marries he would expect his wife to be a virgin.

Most clients don’t use condoms, the women said. “I take birth control injections, but I worry about HIV every day,” said Romida. She has never been tested for sexually transmitted diseases.

-Safe Spaces-

Half an hour’s drive away from the muddy, chaotic camps, surrounded by green rice paddies, local charity Pulse has set up a safe house for refugees that can host up to 30 women. Due to open in the coming days, the dormitory-style apartment is newly refurbished and has a psychologist on site.

“The girls who come here might not want to talk about what is happening in their lives as they could be in danger,” said the shelter’s manager Kurshida Aktar, adding that all vulnerable women are welcome: victims of rape, single mothers and sex workers.

“We’re creating an opportunity for women to rebuild their lives, access basic needs, have an outlet to talk and receive job training,” said Aktar. But the four Rohingya women who agreed to speak were largely unaware of such services. “We don’t ask about it for fear of being found out,” said Kamru, the youngest of the girls.

As she walks outside the house, she slips into her black burqa, covering all but her eyes. “I have to take it off when I’m with my Bangladeshi clients,” she said. “But in the camp it’s my way to stay anonymous.”","['industry', 'dont', 'camp', 'women', 'bangladeshi', 'rohingya', 'struggle', 'vulnerable', 'food', 'booms', 'camps', 'sex', 'workers', 'girls', 'water', 'refugee']","Sex workers share common traits: poverty, abusive family members and lack of funds make them vulnerable enough to be trafficked into the camp’s sex industry.

Karaikal: The police on Thursday arrested 10 persons bel�o�n���ging to two different gangs for the alleged gang rape of a 20-year-old woman here on Tues�day night.

A search has been launched to nab four more accused who are absconding. Accord�ing to the police, the victim, working in a private company in Tiruvarur in Tamil Nadu, had accompanied her relative, Selvi (name changed) to meet the latter’s lover, Madan. Madan and Selvi left, leaving the victim at a main road in Karaikal.

Three persons, identified as Jayakanthan, Amir and Kasim, who spotted the victim standing alone, abducted her, taking her to a house in Lemaire Street in the town and raped her, then let her go. The victim made desperate attempts to call Selvi and Madan when another group of 10 men spotted her.

They promised to take the victim home, but they took her to a desolate spot and sexually assaulted her. The victim later managed to reach Selvi on the phone and narrated her ordeal. Both then lodged a complaint with the Karaikal police.

The police admitted the woman for medical examination and arrested 10 persons, identified as Irfan, Kasim, Amir Ali, Akbar Ali, Yusuf, Mubarak, Nassar, Madan, Ezhilarasan and Baburaj in connection with the incident.

Tornado that laid patriarchy bare,,[],2018-12-30 00:16:00,"Before every big, chaotic wave of #MeToo, there was a solitary “Me”.

Singular. Alone. Brave.

“Me” was not held together by a supportive hashtag at one end and a sweet, pink emoji at the other.

“Me” meant mustering courage that overwhelms and makes you tremble a little. “Me” meant deciding to stand up, and then raising your hand to point a finger at a boss, a mentor, a colleague, a teacher. “Me” meant claiming a moment in the world for yourself, to break your silence, to tell your story.

LONE VOICES

For Tanushree Dutta to unleash the second wave of #MeToo in India in September 2018, Lisa Rundle had stood up alone in Canada in 2010 to accuse her boss at Penguin, David Davidar, of inappropriate text messages, stalking and forcing his tongue into her mouth.

Three years before Vinta Nanda took to Facebook to talk of how the sanskari Alok Nath had raped her, a young employee of Phantom Films had accused Vikas Bahl, the director of Queen, of masturbating on her.

Years before journalist Priya Ramani accused M.J. Akbar, a former editor and till recently junior foreign minister, of inappropriate behaviour, a young journalist from Tehelka had accused Tarun Tejpal, her editor, of sexual assault, and the organisation of conspiring to “deal” with the matter quietly.

Before journalist Ghazala Wahab wrote a gut-wrenching account of being molested, repeatedly, by Akbar, there was Ruchika Girhotra, all of 14, taking on the might of inspector general of police S.P.S. Rathore in 1990, and paying for it with her life.

Exactly a year before the 2018 tide of #MeToo hit India, forcing Akbar to step down, Phantom Films to unravel, Alok Nath to get his wife to file a defamation case against Nanda, an Indian law student in the US, Raya Sarkar, had compiled a list of sexual harassers, molesters, creeps in academia so that the women who came after would know whom to avoid, how to navigate.

That 2017 spread-sheet, in which women known only to Sarkar had accused 73 men of sexual harassment, was the first wave of #MeToo in India — an act of “civil disobedience” born out of frustration at the systemic failure to protect women. It drew power and legitimacy from the 87 women, including Ashley Judd, Heather Graham, Daryl Hannah, Salma Hayek, Anjolina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow, who had called out Harvey Weinstein, the Miramax boss with six best picture Oscars, in the US.

THE SECOND WAVE

In just a year, all these women empowered the second wave of #MeToo in India which has been less a gentle ripple, and more a crackling, wild bonfire of vanities. #MeToo was now a concerted campaign against sexual abuse and the culture of impunity.

From the anonymous, often one-word accusations on Sarkar’s spread-sheet, women were now telling their stories in all its gory, traumatising detail — about how men they trusted and worked with had violated and sexually assaulted them.

If there was any shame, it was piled on the perpetrator.

It singed Bollywood, the art world, journalism, stand-up comedy, BCCI, politics...

Many names that came out were not surprising — Akbar, Alok Nath, Sajid Khan, Suhel Seth — to those who knew or had worked with them. Others were shocking. Rajat Kapoor, Kiran Nagarkar, Chetan Bhagat, Vinod Dua…

But there was no stopping #MeToo. The slogan that American activist Tarana Burke coined in 2006 had become a rallying cry, a baton that women were taking from one, carrying for a bit, and then handing over to another.

MASKS CRUMBLE

Overnight the carefully constructed public personas of several powerful men, their fiercely guarded reputations and liberal veneer cracked and then crashed to the ground, exposing them for the creeps and criminals they were.

The formidable editor and minister was now seen as a deviant who liked to welcome young women in his hotel room wearing a bathrobe, or just his unseemly briefs. A lecture from him on women’s empowerment would now forever be unpalatable.

The actor who embodied all that was pious and precious about the great Indian happy family was now known as an alcoholic and a serial molester.

Suhel Seth, the man perennially on screechy news channels heaping insults, was now the creep who groped women and shoved his hand down their tops.

The patriarchal edifice trembled a bit more when #MeToo hit the corporate world. Rahul Johri, CEO of BCCI, was called out. And then, Jammu & Kashmir DSP Shashi Thakur levelled allegations of sexual harassment at former additional director general of police, Alok Puri.

CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE BROKEN

Women breaking their silence, in some cases after decades, has been momentous, cathartic, troubling, profound.

Finding their voice and reclaiming some power has led to relief at no longer being complicit in protecting men who violated them. The response in certain cases has been gratifying.

In some professional spaces it has led to holding men to account for their behaviour, and some redistribution of power.

In Sweden, a sexual harassment scandal has claimed the 2018 Nobel Prize in Literature. In several organisations in India, inquiries by internal complaints committees (ICC) were initiated. In some instances men were asked to step down, film directors were dropped, film projects abandoned.

Vinta Nanda, who is just about coming out of the #MeToo whirlpool to catch her breath, says that since she was not brought up by her parents to stay quiet, speaking out has relieved her of the burden of silence.

Nanda says that what happened to her was at a party where she had had a few drinks, and was helpless. “Yet, after that I went from pillar to post telling my story. In 2004-5, my account was printed on the front page of a leading newspaper, everyone read it, yet there was silence.”

She says that the world at that time was not ready to listen. That there was a conspiracy of silence.

“There’s not a single soul in the industry who doesn’t know the Jekyll & Hyde that is Alok Nath. Everyone has always known what kind of a predator he is. Yet no one said anything. They were all pretending like nothing had happened”.

The reason Nanda decided to write her Facebook post in October, she says, was because “I just knew that I had support from this younger generation — who are fearless, anarchist. They helped me find my voice again.”

Dutta and Nanda in turn empowered others to speak up — about producer Gaurang Doshi, directors Sajid Khan, Rajat Kapoor, Dibakar Banerjee, Subhash Ghai, Vivek Agnihotri, singers Abhijeet Bhattacharya, Kailash Kher, Raghu Dixit, music director/singer Anu Malik, lyricist Vairamuthu, talent manager Anirban Blah, casting director Mukesh Chhabra…

THE GREY AREAS

Then came the messy #MeToo accounts, where seemingly there was consent. Despite the power equation, from outside, and often even to the perpetrator and the victim, these looked like consensual affairs. These accounts probed and challenged the concept of consent further.

Amrita Narayanan, a clinical psychologist and author who has edited an anthology of Indian writing on erotica, The Parrots of Desire, says that sexual harassment has very little to do with sex or sexual desire.

“It’s about wielding power. In mutual sex, there’s desire and affection. But pathological sexually harassers have no concept of the other person, of the women. In their sexual arena, it’s all about owning, exhibiting and exerting power — and because they don’t see the other, because they see the women as objects and themselves as the only subject, harassers talk of consent, consensual relations,” Narayanan said.

Thankfully, the reaction of men who have been accused of sexual harassment has not been homogenous.

Some have understood, empathised, apologised and taken a step back.

“But for men whose fragile masculine identity is built on power and the power of manipulation, #MeToo is scary, it’s very bad news… It’ll lead to a deep sense of chaos. So, push-back is natural,” says Narayanan.

US President Donald Trump, himself accused of 20 instances of sexual misconduct, said of Christine Blasey Ford, who had accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, “They destroy people. They want to destroy people. These are really evil people.”

Alok Nath’s wife filed a defamation case against Nanda.

Akbar filed a defamation suit against Priya Ramani, and after Pallavi Gogoi, a journalist now based in the US, accused him of rape, his wife, Mallika Akbar, accused the then 24-year-old of wrecking her family life by having an affair with her husband.

A leading psychoanalyst in India, Mallika Akbar chose to dismiss women who had accused her husband of sexual harassment because, according to her, they never “carried the haunted look of victims of sexual assault” and because they had “happily” wined and dined at her house.

FEMALE ENABLERS

Female enablers, perhaps the deadliest tool of patriarchy, are often recruited to divide and destroy any movement that challenges traditional power structures and privileges.

Like the old, fogey feminists who had questioned and sought to discredit Raya Sarkar’s list, this time around the protectors and enablers were out and about interrogating the women who had spoken up.

“Why did you go to the hotel? What kind of girl enters a room when a man in an underwear opens the door? I would have slapped and left. Why speak up now, after so many years?”

These questions didn’t just betray complete lack of empathy for the lived experience of most women in India, but also put the onus on the women.

Instead of questioning the boss who called employees to a hotel room, who molested young employees in his cabin, on the sets of a film shoot, these enablers wanted to know “what kind of women” were the victims of sexual abuse.

“Notice how the men have stepped out of the discourse, turning it into a women versus women fight,” says Nanda.

Speaking of the enablers, she says, “These women feel no power of their own. They have only felt it through men, they can’t feel it within themselves, thus the need to stand by powerful men who, according to them, are being vilified and pilloried.”

Susan Faludi wrote in her 1991 book, Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women, “The backlash is a preemptive strike that stops women long before they reach the finish line.”

American comedian Louis C.K., who has admitted to masturbating in front of several women, has started performing again. Brett Kavanaugh is a US Supreme Court judge. In India too, clean chits are being issued, many of the men accused by multiple women of sexual harassment are quietly returning to resume charge.

MEN & MALENESS

The famous American cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead, often credited with laying the foundation for the 1960s sexual revolution, said that since “maleness” is not absolutely defined, “it has to be re-earned every day, and one essential element in its definition is beating women in every game that both sexes play.”

Men beat women. At everything.

It’s ingrained. It’s believed. Its how the world must remain.

Because pivoted on this belief is the distribution of wealth, resources, power.

Mead also said, “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has”.

WHITHER JUSTICE

Many ask, what does justice for victims of #MeToo look like.

Is it simply that a “somebody” becomes a “nobody”?

No.

#MeToo is about truth and reconciliation.

Since there is no law which takes into account how pervasive, common, wide-spread sexual harassment is, no legislation that seeks to change and challenge something that is so normalised, justice in #MeToo cases, for now, depends on the response.

If there’s acknowledgement of the inflicted pain, hurt, trauma, if there’s remorse, if there’s an apology, then there’s closure and the women who have spoken up can try to move on.

But if there’s belligerence, denial, lies, aggression, attempt to intimidate and shame, then it’s not over.

Journalist-author Tushita Patel says that the reason she decided to write her account of sexual assault is because she “could not stand by and watch Akbar lie”.

The #MeToo accounts, often from successful, seemingly powerful women with a strong sense of self, have chronicled a history of men’s sexual violence and women’s powerlessness. And though there’s been a “sisterhood” bond never seen before, it’s not been easy.

It’s been intense, overwhelming. Not just for the women who have spoken up, and those around them, but also for those reading these accounts — especially the men and women who believed, and supported.

In social media posts about #MeToo revelations now, the etiquette is to issue a “trigger warning” in the beginning, because reading another’s account can be emotionally stirring, distressing. It can also trigger a reaction, making sexual abuse survivors relive their own trauma.

THE #METOO WARRIORS

India’s 2018 #MeToo owes a huge debt to all those who came before — from Bhanwari Devi to the men and women who took to the streets to demand justice for Nirbhaya in 2012, from the women who accused R.K. Pachauri of sexual assault and Mahmood Farooqui of rape, to Rupan Deol Bajaj and Raya Sarkar.

But #MeToo 2018 also drew its power and heft from the men and women who believed and supported it at a great emotional cost to themselves. Some may themselves have gone through sexual abuse and haven’t spoken about it, while others could not bear the injustice and decided to take up the cudgels on behalf of those who had.

Some #MeToo Enablers, Warriors sent personal messages of support, while others openly expressed their outrage and anger. They demanded action, held men in power to account. They argued, fought battles on Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, at seminars, on TV for those who had spoken up, and for those who haven’t yet.

As we celebrate the small victories while worrying about the gradual rehabilitation of serial harassers, and another wave of #MeToo ebbs, in the lull before the third wave, which I believe will be bigger, stronger, let’s raise a toast to the #MeToo Warriors — it's to them that #MeToo 2018 belongs.","['laid', 'metoo', 'patriarchy', 'power', 'india', 'women', 'bare', 'theres', 'accused', 'tornado', 'akbar', 'men', 'harassment', 'sexual']","And then, Jammu & Kashmir DSP Shashi Thakur levelled allegations of sexual harassment at former additional director general of police, Alok Puri.
