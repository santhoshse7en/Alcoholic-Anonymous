"Women alcoholics on the rise in Delhi, and across India","States like Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh have seen a rise in women drinkers. In some of these states, the proportion is higher than that of Delhi.",[],2017-12-10 08:05:00+00:00,"When a sexagenarian wobbled up to the podium at the Frank Anthony Public School in Lajpat Nagar on Saturday, clad in a brown saree, a beige button-down cardigan and sporting a bindi, like every other Indian grandmother you meet in India, the words out of her mouth seemed misplaced.

“I am Rukmini*, and I am an alcoholic”.

Rukmini, who has been sober since May 1995, is one of the 30-35 women who are part of the all female Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) group, Shakti, in Delhi, and played a major role setting up the group.

According to members of Shakti, the Delhi group has the highest number of women as compared to similar groups of other states. This raises the question: have the number of women consuming alcohol in the national capital increased?

Female drinkers in Delhi

According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), in the decade between 2005-2006 and 2015-2016, the percentage of men and women who consumed alcohol in India and the percentage of the male population in Delhi who consumed alcohol has reduced. However, the percentage of women in Delhi who consumed alcohol has gone up from 0.4% of the female population in 2005-2006, to 0.7% in 2015-2016.

Other states like Chandigarh, Goa, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh have also seen a rise in women drinkers, and in some of these states the proportion is higher than that of Delhi.

So what brings out more women in Delhi to seek help? Is it because it is easier to get it in Delhi than in other states? And are these women from all walks of life?

Has the consumption of alcohol increased? States like Manipur, Goa and Kerala have seen a rise in women drinke rs. In some, proportion is higher than Delhi. Have you had trouble quitting drinking, even though you have planned to do so?

Have people around you raised concerns about your drinking habits?

Do you drink re gularly, on an almost daily basis?

Do you start your day with a drink, or start shaking if you don’t?

Have you developed a tolerance for liquor, and find yourself needing more alcohol to get drunk?

Has your drinking gotten you into trouble? Either with the law, at work, your friends, your relationships, or family?

Have you found yourself drinking more than you had initially planned to, because you find it hard to stop once you have started?

Have you skipped work or school because of drinking?

Do you drink until you blackout?

Have you felt the need to quit drinking, because you feel that your life would be better? If you have answered yes to more questions here than you feel comfortable with, it might be time to reflect on whetheryou have a problem or not.

Stigma around alcoholism

For 55-year-old Neha*, who has now been sober for 18 years, drinking was a “private” affair.

“I would get sloshed. But I would do it in the privacy of my home because I did not want to be shamed for it. I was the mother of three daughters, and I felt people would question my morals, values and character if I got drunk in public. Men were allowed to drink. It was an accreditation of their masculinity if they drank. It is not the same for women,” said Neha, who had started drinking to cope with an abusive marriage.

According to Dr Samir Parikh, a psychiatrist at the Fortis Hospital, there are strong stigmas attached to all mental health issues, and alcoholism is no different. However, what sets it apart is that comes with the added baggage of a gender bias against women.

“I would go as far as to say that around 90% of the people who admit they have a problem and seek help are men. Even if a woman is ready to admit she has a problem, she may not get the help she needs because she will be shamed for it,” said Dr Veena Kapoor, former president of the Indian Association of Private Psychiatry in Delhi, and a practising psychiatrist in south Delhi.

It seems that the younger lot are able to accept the disease because of increased information. It may still be an uphill task for the older generation to accept the problem, as shown in the case of 26-year-old Liya, the youngest of the group, when she told her mother-in-law to be about her addiction.

“She jumped out of her skin. She kept telling me how they came from a ‘simple’ ‘good’ family. I don’t think she could even fathom it,” said Liya, who first started drinking at the age of 13.

Priya*, 29, had vowed that she would never touch alcohol after growing up watching her alcoholic father. However, when she was 17, her father sobered up, and Priya had her first taste of a cocktail – a mojito.

What had first started as a “social lubricant,” alcohol soon started to dictate her life. Priya hit rock bottom when she had a blackout and fell from the second floor balcony and had to be hospitalised.

She went into recovery when she was 23, and has not had a drink since. She now volunteers with AA and travels around to help create more awareness about the problem and the programme.

“It is not that Delhi has a bigger problem. I have been to north eastern states, where almost every second or third house has a female alcoholic. It is also because some of these states are matriarchal. In Delhi, I think we are just more accepting, which makes it easier for women to seek help. I remember my mother was not ashamed when I had to check in to rehabilitation centre. We did not shout it from the rooftops, but she was more concerned about my well being than what others would think,” she said.

For 37-year-old south Delhi girl Kritika*, who has now been sober for around two and a half years, the stigma is a matter of the past. “There is no stigma anymore, at least I have not faced it in my circles. You go to Hauz Khas Village right now, and you will see how many people are getting drunk. So people are used to drinking problems. Addiction is a pathological dependence on a substance. If anyone is going to stigmatise that, you are destroying other people’s lives,” she said, while admitting that she may be afforded the luxury because of her socioeconomic background.

"Narcotics Anonmyous helps kick drug addiction, one day at a time","Narcotics Anonymous is a non-profit, international community working for recovering addicts in over 60 countries.",[],2015-12-06 14:10:00+00:00,"He was only eight when his father handed him his first packet. His father was also an addict, a fact that he didn’t know then. The packet of drugs instead helped the father bond with his son.

Occasionally rubbing his palms and wiping sweat from his forehead on a December evening, he said that a major part of his life was spent feeling extremely depressed and vulnerable, even in his private space.

As a doctor, he said, he kept abusing drugs — in between treating patients — in order to create a façade of being normal and “staying sane”.

For him, it was not difficult laying hands on even the most restricted of drugs, thanks to his profession. That was till he found solace in Narcotics Anonymous after about 30 years of addiction.

Narcotics Anonymous is a non-profit, international community working for recovering addicts in over 60 countries.

“I knew I had to stop when I hit rock bottom at the age of 46. I was tired of pretending to be a person that I was not. I have seen psychiatrists and often had a feeling that I was going mad,” said the former drug addict with sweaty, shivering hands but a stern voice.

His eyes had drooped and he looked older than his age. But he decided to fight his addiction and kept at it till he managed to pull himself out of the pit after years of addiction. He failed several times. But every time he slipped, there was Narcotics Anonymous and people like him at the community who gave him the support and helped him get back up and fight.

For members of the community, Friday was just another day in their attempt to stay away from their addiction. Inside a small classroom at south Delhi’s Fr. Agnel School, Gautam Nagar, members sat in a circle, sharing stories of recovery from years of substance abuse — heroin, cocaine, hash, LSD, snakebite or whatever else that would come as a temporary ‘relief’.

“The best part about this place is that I do not have to worry about being judged. These people are as imperfect and messed up as I am. Everyone has a story which is similar to mine and this makes the ongoing struggle easier. One day at a time, but we are getting there,” said another member.

This member is a resident of Australia and finds time to attend Narcotics Anonymous meetings in whichever country he is staying at. Much like Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous also has regular meetings on scheduled days. At least four groups of Narcotics Anonymous hold meetings in different parts of the city, where professionals, students, working women and visitors to the city gather and talk about living without drugs for one day at a time.

On Friday — amidst overflowing emotions, a few breakdowns, laughs and some fits of anger — a ‘trusted member’ sat quietly in a corner waiting for his turn to share his experience.

After a moment of initial hesitation, he started: “I grew up in a perfect Indian family. So, like the scene in most middle-class families, whatever I did in life was never good enough for my parents. My entire life was a fight of trying to fit into their perfect world. But every time there was a rough edge left,” he said with an expressionless face, eyes glued to a corner of the room.

“When I joined college and started doing drugs with my group, it was the first time I felt that I fit in somewhere. It was like I belonged there. Years after when I came here, I somehow get the same feeling. It is like I belong here,” he said.

The meeting ended with a prayer where all the members held hands as if giving each other hope and confidence to choose life for another day. Because they were all like “square pegs in a round world” and somehow everyone just fitted in.

The destroyer of all that is… good,"Fire gives us warmth, but it also burns us. We use it to our advantage, but never get too close to it. Our sense of survival and self-preservation kicks in the moment it gets too close to us. How come that doesn’t happen with alcohol? Aamir Khan writes.",['Aamir Khan'],2012-07-01 23:11:00+00:00,"Fire gives us warmth, but it also burns us. We use it to our advantage, but never get too close to it. Our sense of survival and self-preservation kicks in the moment it gets too close to us. How come that doesn’t happen with alcohol? In fact, alcohol doesn’t even come with all the various benefits of fire, but in terms of its ability to destroy, I might say it is as devastating, if not more… certainly more treacherous!

Across the country, in every state, alcoholism has destroyed scores of families. It’s a disease, which may afflict one member of the family, but its symptoms, and the destruction it causes, spreads to the whole family. It contributes to domestic violence… it affects the education of children… it affects the ability of a family to spend on healthcare… causes unemployment… These are just a few examples of the collateral damage it causes.

When I used the word ‘disease’ to describe alcoholism, I was not using the word lightly. Today, studies have shown that it is in fact a disease and not a ‘bad habit’ that most of us perceive it to be. Some of us are potential alcoholics, and when such people start to drink, we find ourselves getting sucked into it more and more, and try as we might we are unable to come out of it. It’s like a whirlpool which sucks you in. Unfortunately there is no medical test available which can warn you of this.

There are four indications that you may be headed towards alcoholism. They can be easily remembered as the acronym, C.A.G.E. Cut, Anger, Guilt and Eye opener. Ask yourself the following four questions, one “yes” response suggests an alcohol use problem. More than one “yes” is a strong indication that a problem exists.

1. Cut: Are people who are very close to you, repeatedly telling you that you need to CUT down on your drinking?

2. Anger: Are you getting ANGRY and upset as a result of people close to you telling you that you should cut down on your drinking?

3. Guilt: Are you promising yourself that you will not go beyond a certain number of drinks today, and then once you start drinking you are unable to control yourself, and then the next day you feel guilty and upset with yourself for not being able to stick to your resolution?

4. Eye-Opener: Have you now reached a stage in your life when you sometimes need alcohol to start your day? You wake up in the morning and you realize that you are unable to start your day, unable to function, without having a drink.

Unfortunately, there is no medicine that can cure us of this disease of alcoholism. But there is an organization which can help us if we so decide, and that is, Alcoholics Anonymous. Alcoholics Anonymous is a worldwide organization, and it has so far helped three hundred million people all over the world. In India too they have many centers and are spread across the country. Following are their contact details. To reach AA by phone, call +919022771011. To reach AA by text message, type AAAA <space> your name, address and contact number, and send the SMS to 56363.

Of all the people who consume alcohol, not everybody becomes an alcoholic. In fact, as per experts, of all the people who consume alcohol in India, one in twenty, that is 5%, become alcoholics. But one in two, that is 50%, indulge in what is called ‘hazardous drinking’. So, you may not drink everyday, and you may not be an alcoholic, but every time you drink, you drink so much, that, you are no longer in your senses, and you cause harm to yourself and to others. Or, you may consume just one or two pegs and still behave in a hazardous manner… for example by driving a car after that.

How many times have I heard these lines said by a drunk person… “I’m not drunk, I can drive, I’m in my senses” … or, “ Chill yaar, don’t stress, I’ve had just two drinks, I am totally in control”.

Hello?!!!

Every drunk person thinks he is the cat’s whiskers and a superhuman in every way! Absurd! A car is like a killing machine in the hands of a person who has consumed even a little alcohol! And if you have decided to sit in the driver’s seat after consuming any quantity of alcohol then you should be treated as a potential murderer.

40-60% of all cases coming into Emergency rooms of hospitals in India are alcohol related! 35% of those are people who themselves have consumed alcohol, and 65% are people who have not consumed alcohol themselves but have been injured by someone else who has.

So guys, if we can live without alcohol… nothing better than that. But if some of us want to drink, then let’s at least be responsible about it!

When I was going through all the research material and interviews for this topic, I was completely shattered after watching the testimony of Mr. Sumir Anand. The tragic story of how he, and his wife Gitika, lost their 14 year old son, Curran, was really heartbreaking. It’s like a nightmare that every parent dreams a thousand times! The first thing I did after watching the testimony was to call up my children Ira and Junaid, who are 13 and 18 respectively, and I asked him to come home. I showed them Mr. Anand’s interview. And what I made them promise me then, is the promise that I think all of us ought to make to ourselves, and that is:

NEVER drink and drive! And, NEVER sit in a car when the person driving has consumed even one drop of alcohol! Make this a rule for life!

Jai Hind! Satyamev Jayate!

Rehan, Cough syrup addict

“I am an addict. I didn’t have issues when growing up. In fact, it was a happy, upper-middle class childhood. Neither was there any alcoholism in the family. My dad drank every day but in moderation.

It was on a school trip in my 11th standard that I tasted beer for the first time. I hated the taste. But I was still getting sloshed every single day. By my twelfth standard, most of my core group was using hash, grass and cough syrup. I looked down on every friend of mine who did drugs.About six months later, a new friend pushed me to try cough syrup. Nothing happened initially. I went home and that’s when it hit me. It was such a strong feeling, I couldn’t shake it off. I experimented with marijuana, pills, and alcohol – but cough syrup kept pulling me. At my peak, I was downing about six bottles daily. I hid it well and no one found out. It took me a long time to admit I had a problem. At one point, I told my dad. He said ""Buri aadat hai, bete, par choot jayegi."" I wanted to scream no, I’m reaching out for help.I heard about Narcotics Anonymous in 1995. At first I thought, this isn’t for me. I was sure I could quit on my own. My friend kept pushing me to attend the meetings. At one point, I accepted that I can’t fight it on my own. A year and a half later, I was clean.The first day was difficult. There were withdrawal symptoms. Now, it’s been over 12 years and I am a marketing professional. I have a beautiful wife, a two and a half year old daughter; there’s another baby on the way; I have a wide circle of friends; what more do I need, honestly?""I blame my addiction on the environment I grew up in. There wasn’t anything in particular. I was just a loner and stressed out for some reason. Normal people go from school to college to a job. I went from school to college to not passing out of college and doing drugs.I first smoked marijuana in my first year because I hated engineering. My parents wanted me to go into the Merchant Navy, another thing I had no interest in. So marijuana was awesome. It made my mind shut up for an hour or two. Slowly, I started using harder drugs.There came a point a few years later when I did not remember one moment from the next. I almost went senile. At the peak, I would wake up and just head straight to my peddler. He opened shop at half past eight. I used to be plonked outside at a quarter past. I became so pally with him that I used to even get drugs on credit, which is an amazing achievement.It was only a matter of time before my parents found out. Fortunately, they were very supportive. My mother asked me if I wanted to go into rehab and I instantly said yes.Less than two hours later, I was in rehab. But 15 days later, I ran away. I roamed around all day in Delhi scoring drugs and doing them in an auto. Four o’clock on a Tuesday morning found me on a strange Delhi road with no money to pay the autowalla. That’s when the sense of guilt and shame hit me and hit me hard.I didn’t want to go back into the rehab but I had no choice. It was there that I found out about NA. I was told that you can’t go back to your old life. I stuck around because I did not have anything to look forward to. I was empty and fearful.After I got out from rehab, I did stay clean. But I still kept coming to NA meetings. They gave me a platform to be myself. I made friends. People wore nice clothes; they were happy! For the first time in three years, I laughed.My life is so perfect now I could never have imagined it. I was always afraid of relationships but I got into my first one at an NA meeting. I’ve always looked forward since then, never behind. I’ve been clean for four years now. I love to play music, I love to write. I am doing all the things I really wanted to do. Today, I don’t need a reason to laugh. I just do.

Ruby, Drug addict

I came from a small town. There were a lot of problems in the family when I was growing up. Money was never enough; there was a lot of mental, physical, sexual abuse. I didn’t have a normal childhood.

I came to Delhi in my 11th standard, because I wanted to get away from it all. However, I still felt isolated. So it was in my first year that I had my first drink. I remember downing pegs of neat rum, puking and blacking out.It gave me an immense sense of relief from everything. I felt complete. I started with alcohol and in a few years, I was having it all. It was a fantastic relationship I had with drugs: I didn’t have to put any effort into it, I just had to ingest them.It was only a few years down the line that the downward spiral began. I lost my job; my boyfriend, also a junkie, left me; my health went for a toss; at my lowest point, I thought I was going to die and not be found till way later.I found out about NA in a dramatic fashion. I was reading a book which mentioned Alcoholics Anonymous and I thought, if there’s one for alcoholics, maybe there’s one for narcotics users. I went online and discovered there was one in Delhi very close to where I did my drugs! So I went to a meeting.That was the first time I discovered that addiction is a disease. For years, I had had fingers pointed at me – in our society, a woman doing drugs is worse than guys doing them. But then, I realised that while I was not responsible for the disease, I was responsible for the recovery. I kept attending meetings for a year. Sometimes, I would use before the meetings. But people said, it doesn’t matter, just keep coming, one day, the miracle will happen to you.And guess what? One day, it did. Over the last five and a half years, my life has changed completely. When I first stayed away from drugs for 24 hours, the relief was difficult to put in words. Today, I am a responsible person. I love my job. I take squash and salsa lessons. I have friends who I can share stuff with without being embarrassed. And my relationship with my family has never been better.Addiction is severe dependence on a particular substance. Some addictions can be dealt on one’s own, but heavy use of opiates, cannabis, alcohol and psychotropic drugs requires patients to be sent to a rehabilitation centre. This process has three phases:

Detoxification: To counter initial withdrawal and drastic mood swings, you need to detoxify the patient with vitamin supplements and lots of fluids.

Abstinence: The toughest part of rehab is to keep patients motivated to give up the addiction. You monitor their psychological behaviour and teach self-control. It is also important to make them confident so that they do not succumb again. Sometimes, group therapy is needed, and in severe cases, medication.

Maintenance: It is imperative to counsel friends and family on how to deal with a patient after he or she is out of rehab. Rehabilitation is successful when people around the patient learn to treat him or her with respect.

A patient’s success is dependent on her or his willingness to change. Some addicts require continual support.

Celebrities who overcame their addiction



Angelina Jolie: In 1998, Jolie confessed to doing “just about every drug possible”. Since then, she has become an Oscar-winning actress, a mother of six and even a UN Goodwill Ambassador.

Drew Barrymore: By 11, Barrymore was an alcoholic. By 12, she was doing marijuana, by 13 cocaine. She went to rehab twice and attempted suicide at 14. Today, she is an accomplished actress and producer.

Robin Williams: It’s hard to believe that the movie star and comedian was once a cocaine addict. But after the death of fellow comedian John Belushi, Williams checked into rehab.

But now it’s time to be less sexist as women alcoholics are suddenly tumbling out of the closet. According to Dr Nikhil Raheja, a Dwarka-based psychiatrist and therapist, alcoholism in women is growing at an alarming rate of around 10 per cent. “Even five years ago, we had no women patients,” he says.

At the Masihgarh Church in Sukhdev Vihar — where meetings for Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) are held regularly — there are 14 women who attend meetings now. And Dr Megha Hazuria Gore, clinical psychologist at Max Health Care, agrees that an increasing number of women are admitting to alcohol problem and seeking treatment for it. “Women today see drinking as a part of acceptable social behaviour,” she feels.

Teesta was an alcoholic for 12 years before joining the AA fellowship. Early on, as a newly-wed, her reason for hitting the bottle was a rapidly souring marriage to an abusive husband. “I drank for the high,” she says. Then, there came a time when she’d have blackouts: “I felt I would die without my drink."" Three years ago, she kicked the habit.

Vinita, 32, an ex-airline hostess, started drinking in her early twenties. “I’d finish a bottle of vodka in my room at night when everybody was asleep,” she admits.

It’s not just a bad marriage/love life or stress that’s making women take to the bottle. A case of social drinking gone wrong, Anjali, a naval officer's wife says the frequent cocktail parties are what made her take to liquor. “How long can you sip Coca-Cola wearing high heels?”

The lowest common denominators for these women seem to be: they belong to the upper middle class, are educated and have the money to buy the bottles.

Drink habits: A toast to the new cocktails,"In a large-sample study conducted in Karnataka, NIMHANS found that 65 per cent of the women who drink indulge in hazardous drinking at some point of time or the other, writes Amitava Sanyal.",['Amitava Sanyal'],2008-05-11 00:42:00+00:00,"A wife who drinks spirituous liquor, is of bad conduct, rebellious, diseased, mischievous, or wasteful, may at any time be superseded (by another wife). — Manusmriti

Though she is an alcoholic, Madhavi has not had to face the punishment prescribed by Manu. That’s because the 53-year-old from a Delhi-based Tamil Brahmin family hasn’t married yet. That did not ease her trauma though, some of which she will share again with her fellowship at the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) on May 17. It was on that date 13 years ago that she kicked the bottle. But her memories of being an alcoholic are still raw, as if they happened yesterday. She says haltingly, “Though I had been drinking for only four years, towards the end I was counting my days. I could not even hold a pen and sign cheques.” Her sister found out about AA, Madhavi emerged from her nightmare, and in 1997, went on to start in the Capital the country’s first all-women AA chapter. Today, this chapter attracts at least 10 women everyday, says Madhavi. Why such a low attendance? “Most of the women who stay sober stop coming regularly after 3-4 years, because almost all of them are married — and there is always a greater pressure on women to perform in the household. And we are hardly visited by women below the age of 30, though there are many ‘boys’ in the fellowship. It possibly has to do with the greater stigma that’s applicable to the unmarried woman.”

It’s also true that there are far less women than men alcohol drinkers in the country: roughly one woman to every four male drinkers. But the changing pattern of usage is worth a closer look. In a large-sample study conducted in Karnataka by the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences found that 65 per cent of the women who drink indulge in hazardous drinking at some point of time or the other (against 80 per cent of men). And that women seem to drink less in a positive frame of mind than men. But the drunken violence that’s often the result of such drinking is a preserve of men. Though the incidence of hazardous drinking is as high among the women of rural India as men, they end up being beaten up most of the times.

Shanthi Ranganathan, founder of TTK Foundation in Chennai, the country’s first rehabilitation centre, says, “This part of the country is full of self-help groups working on micro-credit. The financial independence these women get from the job is all wasted by their men who drink and then beat them up. Some have begun to understand the power of groups and are using that to shift out liquor shops.”

Molly Charles, former deputy director at the National Addiction Research Centre in Mumbai, says, “When the financial power equation changes, men either drink more or accommodate.” Here’s hoping that more opt for the latter.

Contentment sutra: how to make peace with yourself,"There will be some things in life that none of us can have any control over- from friendships running their course to your teenage kid hating you. But the sooner we come to terms with them, the more content we shall be, writes Seema Goswami.",['Seema Goswami'],2014-02-08 13:02:00+00:00,"Lord, grant me the strength to accept the things I cannot change; the courage to change the things I can; and the wisdom to know the difference.” This verse, attributed to St Francis of Assisi and later adapted by the American theologian, Reinhold Niebuhr, is now widely used by Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programmes, with the word ‘strength’ replaced by ‘serenity’ and called the Serenity Prayer. But you don’t need to be an alcoholic – or even a Catholic – to benefit from the sentiments expressed in this prayer.

All of us would be better off if we could see the difference between the things that we can change and those we can’t. And we would be much happier if we could make our peace with all the stuff that comes in the ‘can’t’ category. Because let’s face it, there are some things in life that none of us have any control over. And the sooner we come to terms with that fact, the more content we shall be.

So, what are the things you need to make your peace with? Allow me to list, in no particular order of importance, just some of them.

Some friendships will run their course



This is not anybody’s fault. It is just the way things are. Sometimes people grow apart for one reason or the other.

And when that happens, there is no point breaking your head over what went wrong.

Or even trying to recapture that lost intimacy. The only option is to accept the inevitable and move on without any bitterness or regret. Tell yourself that it was good while it lasted – and yes, that nothing lasts forever.

Your teenage kids will hate you

They will act as if your very presence is an embarrassment. They will fob off public displays of affection. They will treat your every pronouncement with derision.

They will spend ages in the bathroom, sulking and yes, hating you.

Until suddenly, one day, they won’t. They will want to hang out with you again, they will ask your advice and cuddles will once again be welcome.

Just stay the course. Normal service will be resumed soon.

You will turn into your parents

It is only a matter of time. It’s not just that one day you will look into the mirror and find your mother or father staring back at you (though that will happen as well). But that you will find yourself telling your kids the very things that your parents used to say to you (and which you swore you would never tell your kids). ‘Come home before it gets dark’. ‘Get up early and study’. ‘Wrap yourself warm before you go out’. ‘Eat something, for God’s sake’.

There will be more ‘doorway moments’ as you get older

If you are in your 40s, you probably know what I mean. Yes, the times you go through the doorway of your bedroom or living room looking for something. But the moment you cross the threshold, you forget what you were looking for. Recent research done by Professor Gabriel Radvansky of the University of Notre Dame has it that the act of passing through a doorway causes memory lapses. But we know different, don’t we? It’s the act of passing through several decades of our lives that really does the trick. You’ve just got to live with it.

The music of the day will begin to seem like senseless noise to you

And you will turn into the kind of music bore you always made fun of.

The sort who listens to the same bands and singers over and over again because he or she grew up with them.

As they don’t say, familiarity breeds contentment.

You will always have regrets

No matter what choices you make in life and no matter how right they seemed at the time, there will come a day when you start to wonder about the road not taken and whether you took a wrong turn along the way. Don’t freak out. This is a part of growing up and even – dare I say it? – growing old. And anyone who tells you otherwise is a lying sod.

Like in the case of other ""target groups"" such as juvenile offenders, drug afflicted youth, marginalised or migrant youth, geographically disadvantaged youth, a detailed survey would be carried out among state LGBT community, so that their problems could be specifically addressed, he said.

Suffering from the ‘Like’ me syndrome?,Angry that no one reacted to your new profile pic? Don’t get trapped into basing your self-worth on online approval. Many youngsters are battling with ‘Facebook validation syndrome.’ They spend a large portion of their day uploading pictures on various sites and regularly updating their status messages.,['Amrah Ashraf'],2011-11-12 16:08:00+00:00,"Gunjan Arora, a Delhi-based primary school teacher, is surrounded by close friends with grave looks on their faces. She looks uneasy and defensive. It looks like an Alcoholic Anonymous meeting, but is actually an intervention popularised by famous sitcom How I Met Your Mother.Gunjan is guilty of being addicted to uploading pictures on Facebook and Picasa. The situation is so grave that she wakes up in the middle of the night to upload new pictures and check comments on her older ones. Every new dress, dinner, or even a visit to a doctor, is documented on her Facebook page in pictures. After updating her status, she pings her friends to like it. Each picture, colour corrected and photoshopped, needs at least five comments for her to feel content or she feels restless. How did things get so bad? She doesn’t know. Her friends have decided to intervene and make her realise that she is basing her self-worth on the comments and likes of her friends, and in that process compromising on her self-esteem. Sadly, Gunjan uploaded pictures of the intervention too!This problem is not limited to Gunjan alone. There are many youngsters out there battling with ‘Facebook validation syndrome.’ They spend a large portion of their day uploading pictures on various sites and regularly updating their status messages. The fact that they compare their lives with that of others based on who went out partying more and the number of new friends others have, make it obvious that the need for validation is constant. Lack of real friends and conversations induces a sense of alienation and more and more people are falling prey to this problem. Interestingly, you are considered ‘cool’ and your life ‘happening’ if you upload more pictures and if your life looks like it’s going places virtually.""I feel that since most youngsters are living in virtual reality, they don’t have too many friends in real life. Obviously they feel a vacuum inside and base their lives on the acceptance of their virtual friends. You always want to be a part of a group; you want to belong somewhere and therefore you wear a mask online to look and sound like your peers so that they accept you,"" says U Vindhya, professor, psychology department, TISS, Mumbai.In fact, if you Google ‘Why people post pictures on Facebook’, you get 1,010,000,000 results. So, we’re not the only ones thinking about this, are we!Earlier, a dinner with friends or a movie with a loved one was all about spending quality time with each other. People chatted about their lives and of course pictures were taken for memories, but today the situation is almost bizarre. Even when one is out with a loved one having a cozy dinner, one is always wondering whether they should tweet a pictures of that perfect lobster or BBM friends about the party tomorrow.""Once a friend of mine tweeted about his plans of proposing to his girlfriend at dinner that night and completely forgot that she was following him. Obviously she got to know and was really angry with him for publicising their private moment but we couldn’t stop laughing about it. Show off!"" says Shaleen Singh, a BPO employee.People tinker away on their cellphones either uploading pictures on Facebook, commenting or waiting restlessly for comments. It is easy to spot the restless eye constantly looking at the cellphone to see if people have responded to his ‘awesome’ twitpic. ""It is very disturbing to see people like that. The constant need for approval and validation from friends and peers is alarming. I see so many girls and boys with a cellphone in their hands, glancing repeatedly at it,"" adds U Vindhya.Getting a response may be quite high on their agenda but what happens if the response if negative? It is almost catastrophic. ""We were out for dinner when a friend of mine realised that some of her friends had written nasty things about her new display picture. Not only did she refuse to eat anything, she picked a fight with them online and ruined dinner for all of us,"" says Robin Raju, a Mumbai-based PR professional.A recent study from the University of Buffalo in the US stated that women who post a lot of pictures on Facebook base their self-worth on appearance and crave approval. It went on to receive a lot of flak for being insensitive towards women, but one couldn’t help but accept that most social activity on the Net does have a lot to do with self-worth. Adding to this study, many psychologists feel that it is definitely not just a woman thing. Men are equally active and concerned about how they come across on the Internet.""It is utter rubbish to assume that only women are concerned about their social identity on the Internet.I feel men are equally concerned about it. It is preposterous to assume that women are vain and men are not. Whether it is about self-worth or not, that is debatable, but men and women are equally active on social networking sites and love to change their profile pictures to look better in the eyes of the others,"" says Farzana, a Mumbai-based psychologist.Psychologists feel that people need to start living their lives outside the ""realms of social networking."" No one’s asking you to stop posting pictures or relinquishing your online identity, but one needs to draw a line somewhere. Twitter on they say but don’t let the bird dictate terms to you. Don’t lose your identity in the ping-post, update-upload shenanigans of social networking sites.Recently, Demi Moore posted her nude picture on Twitter. Are we supposed to love your new skinny frame Ms Moore?Lenny Kravitz tweeted a picture of his nude rear. Salvaging his career, maybe!Courtney Love is quite infamous for posting scandalous pictures on Twitter and seeking comments from her followers.How can we forget Lindsay Lohan’s numerous nude attempts to grab attention on social networking sites.

Close brushes: Phil Collins says he nearly died from excessive drinking,Veteran musician Phil Collins says he was forced to quit drinking after he was diagnosed with a severe case of pancreatitis.

The 63-year-old says he began drinking heavily after stepping away from the music industry in 2010.



Collins' boozing became so bad, he began attending Alcoholics Anonymous (Aa) meetings and spent a week in rehab, but he did not take his problems seriously until he was diagnosed with pancreatitis, an inflammation of the pancreas, which causes internal bleeding and extreme pain.



Collins insists his problems began after his ex-wife remarried and moved from Switzerland to Miami, Florida with their two youngest children, reports contactmusic.com.

He said: ""I nearly died. I had pancreatitis... I'd retired to be with the kids... And really, retiring - well not working - and not having the kids, I guess left a big void... I was supposed to be an alcoholic... I went to meetings and I did try rehab - for a week.



“But I couldn't stand it. It was like being at boarding school. So I said to myself, 'I know what I need to do, I'm not a f*****g alcoholic... I was taking medication for this (tendon problems) and for all kinds of different little things. (The prescription pills) were not mixing with the drink, basically...



“The kids were getting a little worried and that's what made me worried... I found myself a great doctor here in America, and I went to a couple of specialists. And I don't drink any more. And I've never fallen off the wagon. I've just been lucky.""

"India's gay law breeds intolerance, says UN chief","Speaking on a visit to the capital New Delhi, Ban said he 'staunchly opposed the criminalisation of homosexuality' referring to Section 377, India's colonial-era law, that prohibits gay sex.",[],2015-01-13 11:26:00+00:00,"United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon has accused India of fomenting intolerance with its ban on gay sex amid uproar over a Goa minister's plans to make homosexuals ""normal"".

Speaking on a visit to the capital New Delhi, Ban said he ""staunchly opposed the criminalisation of homosexuality"" referring to Section 377, India's colonial-era law, that prohibits gay sex.

""I am proud to stand for the equality of all people--including those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender,"" the UN secretary general said in a statement late Monday.

""I speak out because laws criminalising consensual, adult same-sex relationships violate basic rights to privacy and to freedom from discrimination. Even if they are not enforced, these laws breed intolerance.""

The Supreme Court reimposed a ban on gay sex in late 2013, ruling that the responsibility for changing the 1861 law rested with lawmakers and not judges.

Gay sex had been effectively legalised in 2009 when the Delhi High Court ruled that banning ""carnal intercourse against the order of nature"" was a violation of fundamental rights.

Ban's comments came on the same day that a Goa minister, who belongs to the Bharatiya Janata Party, announced his plans to make gays ""normal"" in the state.

Ramesh Tawadkar, sports and youth affairs minister in Goa government, told reporters that he planned to open up centres on the lines of Alcoholics Anonymous to treat them.

""We will make them normal. We will have centres for them, like Alcoholic Anonymous centres,"" Tawadkar said, adding that the state would ""train them and give them medicines too"".

Tawadkar made the comments after releasing the state's policy on youth issues which listed lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders as a stigmatised group that needed attention.

Eureka! My space is online!,"If you are a regular on a social network, chances are that you feel disoriented without your daily fix, reports Vipul Mudgal.",['Vipul Mudgal'],2008-02-11 03:05:00+00:00,"If you are a regular on a social network, chances are that you feel disoriented without your daily fix. And if you are a victim of prohibition in office or load-shedding at home, the yearning can cause anything between angst and neurosis.

A teenager quoted in MIT Tech Talk sums up the trend succinctly: “If you are not on MySpace, you don’t exist.” The network clocked 45.2 billion page views in August 07, miles ahead of 17.4 billion page views of the entire world’s blogs put together during the same period. Rival Orkut has over 45 million communities on it and a relatively smaller Facebook boasts of 2.2 billion friends tagged in 1.7 billion user photos. A sizeable section of users on top global networks are Indians despite dozens of India specific sites like BigAdda, Yaari or DesiMartini.

<b1>After the Internet, free e-mails, messengers, user groups and chat rooms, social networks come as the next logical step. A typical user first logs in to create a personal profile and then simply hangs out there or joins others using scrapbooks, best buddies or likeness matches. On networks like Ning you create your own sub-sites like the wheeledones (for wheelchair users) or Gaxbeta (for ardent gamers). Raw food lovers’ sub site ‘Give it to me Raw’ has sub-sub-sites like Raw Humour, Raw Beauty or Yoga in the Raw. The matrix spans around a web of inter-connected nodes based on shared ties or values.

Social networking on the web is what it has always been, an elemental human trait. Societies have always revolved around networks of religions, castes, communities or kinships. The Internet has only added a virtual dimension to alliances like merchant guilds or trade unions. What has changed decisively is the ease with which ‘digital publics’ zip across barriers of time and space. For example, Alcoholic Anonymous or Bono’s anti-poverty network, One.Org, can easily overlap with, say, book lovers’ group Shelfari or the soccer community’s Joga.com.

Of late, social networks have made news for negative reasons. A Mumbai teenager got trapped through a fake Orkut profile and murdered by his own friends. A US teenager was shot dead by an uninvited guest at a teenage party publicized on MySpace. Another Indian student landed up in jail for vulgarising a girl’s photo online. But passions were really inflamed when the “We hate India” community posted objectionable stuff on a popular network. (Later, users of “We hate those who hate India” issued suitable rebuffs.) No wonder parents, governments and the media sometimes get anxious. The US is working on a proposed legislation, Deleting Online Predators Act (DOPA), which requires all federally aided schools and libraries to deploy Internet filters.

Social networks make great business sense. On-line ad spend has already surpassed broadband penetration in the US. The fact that in 2007 US Internet companies outperformed the broader stock market perhaps explains why global brick and mortar companies are out to lap up, or synergise with, them. Obviously, social networks are here to stay.

Never planned to quit smoking: Anonymous confession of nicotine addict,"Post World No Tobacco Day (May 31), here is an anonymous confession of a nicotine addict, or what everyone else calls a chain-smoker.",[],2015-06-02 18:47:00+00:00,"Post World No Tobacco Day (May 31), here is an anonymous confession of a nicotine addict, or what everyone else calls a chain-smoker.

I don’t have a terminal disease. I didn’t quit on my doctor’s insistence or my family’s emotional blackmail. I am not religious, so Godmen and evangelists are out of the question. The escalating cost might have had a miniscule role to play, but that’s it, as far as external factors are concerned. The truth is I never planned to quit.



Like all smokers’, my system, too, had become adept at clouding my judgment when it came to my own addiction. The rational part of my brain knew how bad smoking was. Yet, the other, crippled by a habit that I feel is widely underestimated, would always win. The logic is simple: smokers don’t consider themselves drug addicts. They are just in denial about a habit that’s eating them alive.

My journey began on an anticlimactic note. I had finished one too many packets at a party one night. My lungs weren’t in pain the next morning, but I found myself just tired and temporarily bored of the activity itself. So, I thought I’ll keep the daily number to three for a bit. I had one-and-a-half cigarettes the next day. The morning after, I was just going to light the first one of the day when I got busy with work. Usually, I would have let the world burn while I took those seven minutes off, but that boredom persisted. I knew I was coming back for that killer post-lunch smoke anyway.

On day two, I woke up unbelieving that I hadn’t smoked a single one the day before. My pack had eight cigarettes and one stub intact. “Good, I wouldn’t have to stop to buy a pack on my way to work,” I thought. The next two days passed in a similar manner; I missed the morning cigarettes because I was busy, and kept planning to have the post-lunch and post-dinner one, but just never found the right moment. Since I had no plans to quit, I didn’t feel the need to tell anyone that I hadn’t smoked in three days.

On day five, some friends realised I wasn’t lighting up as often, and asked me if I had quit. “Was I really quitting cigarettes after 10 long years?” I thought to myself. But before the pressure mounted, I copped out and said, “Of course not.” To be honest, I didn’t have enough faith in myself, and I didn’t want to cry wolf in case I didn’t last.

Day six came, and with it, arrived the withdrawal symptoms. Nothing can prepare you for these. My stomach churned. My head ached. I gnashed my teeth, and felt like the world was against me even when this decision was entirely my own. I snapped at everyone in sight. I started eating more. I put on weight. There I was thinking quitting was supposed to be good for me. Only the food tasted better. I knew day 14 was as far as I was going to go. So, I started easing myself back into regular life.

The first major test: I went out drinking. For those who are social, this is half the problem. People will ask you for a lighter, offer you drags, leave you holding on to their lit cigarettes, blow smoke into your face and laugh every time you say you don’t want one. It was like leaving an alcoholic in a wine shop. “You’re quitting or what?” they’d mock. “Of course not,” I’d say.

To combat the urge, I decided to hold a cigarette. It smelled tempting. I stood around smokers. Never once did I let my body feel deprived of it. I got through the night, and many more. I felt damn good because my abstinence was giving me the motivation I needed every day. My friends figured my plan, and started subliminally encouraging me to delay that ‘inevitable’ smoke.

People say nothing feels better than quitting smoking; that you’ll hate the cigarette once you succeed. But that’s not true. In the short run, the disadvantages of quitting far outweigh the advantages. And the long run always seems too far away to be bothered about it.

Even today, there are days when I crave it. I love it, and I always will. I lied to myself once when I started smoking, thinking I’ll quit in a few years. I wasn’t going to fool myself again. On May 31, I had been cigarette-free for 100 days. I had allowed myself a smoke on day 100, but I got lazy. Maybe I’ll have one today, maybe I’ll have one in the next year, I don’t know, because, in reality, I don’t ever remember quitting.

High court says IAF ‘irresponsible’ for confining corporal to psychiatric ward without consent,"The Delhi high court told the Indian Air Force that the Mental Health Act had made it clear a person cannot be forced to undergo treatment without his consent, adding that the IAF “cannot ignore the laws of the country”",['Press Trust Of India'],2018-07-12 20:42:00+00:00,"The Indian Air Force (IAF) faced the ire of the Delhi High Court on for confining one of its non-commissioned officers, a corporal, to a psychiatric ward for over two months, because he was an alcoholic and suffered from mental disorders.

A bench of justices S Muralidhar and Vinod Goel questioned the rationale behind the IAF’s decision, asking how it determined on a daily basis that the corporal still “craved for alcohol”.

The court also said the newly-enacted Mental Health Act made it clear that a person could not be forced to undergo treatment without his consent, adding that the IAF “cannot ignore the laws of the country”.

Terming the conduct of the IAF “irresponsible”, the bench wondered how many of such cases there might be, which were yet to be highlighted.

“How were you determining on a daily basis that his craving for alcohol had not gone down? What tests were conducted by you? This is completely irresponsible. We wonder how many such cases are there.

“This is a clear case where a man is saying he has been detained without consent. Under the new Mental Health Act, you cannot force him to undergo treatment without his consent. Then how are you pumping him full of drugs? We do not know who should be proceeded against,” the bench said.

It added that the IAF needed to be reminded not to interfere with a person’s liberty as “short of chaining him up, everything else was done here” and directed that the corporal be produced in court tomorrow.

According to the IAF, represented by the Centre’s standing counsel, Ripudaman Singh Bhardwaj, the action against the corporal was taken on a complaint from his wife that he turned violent after consuming alcohol.

Bhardwaj said the corporal, Kriyad Yogesh Bhankhariya, had alcohol dependency issues for which he was initially treated in the psychiatric ward of the Army Base Hospital here and thereafter, in June, he was shifted to the medical centre at the Tughlakabad Air Force Station.

The court said if the non-commissioned officer (NCO) was an alcoholic, then the IAF ought to have sought the help of the “Alcoholics Anonymous” on how to deal with the matter as any psychiatric would confirm that confinement of a person was advisable only in extreme cases.

“It is worrying, the manner in which you have approached the situation,” the bench told the IAF.

The court was hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by the 30-year-old corporal’s father, claiming that his son was being illegally confined at the Army Base Hospital.

Read for yourself what the critics think of the film.Mayank Shekhar finds the plot of the film confusing. He begins his review ridiculing the plot and says, ""This is a film on the dangers of alcohol addiction, subsequent loss of voice, and the end of a musical career."" He further clarifies, ""Alcoholic Anonymous and similar agencies that work on alcohol dependence issues should ideally co-opt this picture for their public service message. But they may not be quite satisfied with this effort.""Claiming to portray the sins of fame, Aashiqui 2 shows Aditya Roy Kapur as the arrogant famous singer who loses his career. For all the loss and sins of fame, the audience will not know the cause or the story of the protagonist's downfall.Shekhar also writes, ""It is a film about the transient nature of fame. The ideal subject could have been the original Aashiqui’s lead actors Rahul Roy and Anu Aggrawal themselves. BBC did a lovely documentary on the ""one-film wonder"" Roy. I met Aggrawal a couple of years ago, her face destroyed by a motor accident, her thoughts still pinned to her glorious past, she almost made me cry. Few people are likely to understand this tragic phenomenon called fame more than those who work in Bollywood that cruelly measures success and worth of artistes almost every week.""Why do I always feel that a lot of such characters should be seeing therapists rather than having films made on them? If this went on for any longer, I’d need to see a shrink too.**Mohit Suri has tried a ""terribly tried and tested"" method. Saibal writes that this 'old' plot does not have anything new to offer, ""Even the lead actors aren't newcomers, so do not expect them to inject any freshness.""Chatterjee further writes, ""The film is obviously meant for a youth audience, which is probably not the easiest segment to inveigle. Aditya Roy Kapoor, in his first full-fledged lead role, exudes the kind of confidence that borders on airiness. He is fine in the lighter moments, but when the drama turns intense, the chinks begin to show. There are situations in the plot that simply aren’t convincing enough, and the young actor can do little to extract something of significance out of them.""The film has sadly stirred up an old story filled it up with even older cliches and the lead pair perhaps does not have the ability yet to perform to cover up where the script lacks.Fluffy and flaky, Aashiqui 2 is simply not peppy enough to paper over its cracks. It does not strike any chords. There aren't too many highs in its hackneyed saga of songs and sighs.*1/2Madhureeta finds the movie pretty entertaining. She writes for her review, ""The real lyric of this story is their romance, pulsating with passion and intensity - on high notes and 'higher spirits'.""Aashiqui 2 does not hold any resemblance either to the 1990 film Aashiqui (to which Aashiqui 2 is claimed to be a sequel) nor can we spot any inspiration from Amitabh Bachchan-starrer Abhimaan. Mukherjee writes, ""Suri's musical love story doesn't bear much semblance to the original 'Aashiqui'; instead it finds its own rhythm.""As for the acting, ""Aditya is likeable in mushy moments, he shows intensity in flashes but sometimes loses grip. A mature role like this demands a lot, nonetheless, it's a good effort.""This could be good soup for the lovers' soul - with a dash of old-world flavour.***1/2The film certainly rides on high hopes with a title as Aashiqui 2, reminiscent of the 1990 film Aashiqui. Shomini writes, ""To make a film with the title 'Aashiqui 2' is not an easy thing as this name carries a baggage of superhit songs and innocent romance.""The film seems to have some misplaced direction as well, Sen writes, "" A beer bar has pictures of Lata Mangeshkar, Manna Dey on its walls. Okay then."" She further says that the movie is completely a predictable romantic film.Moving on to acting, Sen writes, ""Shraddha Kapoor looks beautiful throughout the film. But her performance is..well..too flat..But it's Aditya Roy Kapur who shines as the self destructive super star Rahul Jaykar.""Watch it for the shining star - Adita Roy Kapur.Sengar believes the film could have turned out better with a little more of an intelligent treatment. Resham writes, ""Remaking the 1990`s hit, Aashiqui, was a bright idea, given the adulation for the film still exists in the hearts of the audience. But sadly, Aashiqui 2 has not been given the kind of treatment that a classical on-screen romance should have been given.""The film also fails to even stand up to its title - Aashiqui (romance). Resham writes, ""Aashiqui 2 is quite a clean film unlike the ones that are churned out by the Vishesh Films` factory these days but the quintessential romance element is missing here.""Switching to acting skills of the artists, ""The passion between the lead pair is weakened mainly because of Shraddha Kapoor, who can neither emote nor act to intensify the romance. Instead, it is Aditya Roy Kapur who has tried to make things work in the film by being as real as possible while speaking his lines. He puts in genuine efforts to ignite the much-needed spark of passion between him and his on-screen lady love.""Aashiqui 2 must be watched only for three reasons: a) If you love Aditya Roy Kapoor; b) If the songs are of your liking; c) Just out of curiosity. Otherwise, watch the one starring Anu Agarwal and Rahul Roy and save money.**1/2Going by the reviews, Aashiqui 2 has little to offer if you are looking for a fresh story or awesome cinematic experience. However, Aditya Roy Kapur's acting seems promising. Watch the film, if you must, for Aditya Roy Kapur.Have you watched the movie yet? Share your experience with us.

Review: Doctor Sleep,"Thirty-six years after introducing readers to Danny Torrance and a precognitive ability he came to call ""the shine,"" Stephen King is back with another creepy tale featuring the now adult Dan, a young girl named Abra and a mysterious group of soul-sucking creeps known as the True Knot.",[],2013-09-25 13:27:00+00:00,"Consider this the sequel you never knew you were waiting for, but will be very glad it arrived.



Thirty-six years after introducing readers to Danny Torrance and a precognitive ability he came to call ""the shine,"" Stephen King is back with another creepy tale featuring the now adult Dan, a young girl named Abra and a mysterious group of soul-sucking creeps known as the True Knot.

Read ""The Shining"" first if you haven't already, but don't worry if it's been a few years or decades. King opens with a chapter called ""Prefatory Matters"" and deftly catches readers up with that novel. He begins ""Doctor Sleep"" with Dan starting fresh in New Hampshire after years of trying to outrun his demons. ""His mind was a blackboard. Booze was the eraser,"" writes King. Yes, he's an alcoholic like his late father, but unlike that mallet-wielding madman, he's finally ready to utter those words demanded by Alcoholics Anonymous: ""I need help.""

He finds it in part by becoming a mentor to 12-year-old Abra, whose shining is stronger than his own and who needs some protection from the voices and visions she can't always turn off in her head.

Here King has a little fun with pop culture's current obsession with vampires. Turns out those caravans of motor homes on America's highways or parked in a circle at a campground are nothing but a front for undead demons who survive by inhaling the ""steam"" that telepaths and seers like Dan and Abra give off.

They've been around for centuries, hiding in plain sight, and feasting on folks who shine.

The leader of the True Knot is one of King's best baddies in years - Rose O'Hara, aka Rosie the Hat - a 6-foot beauty fond of wearing a top hat and hellbent on sacrificing Abra for the survival of her species. King's a master at writing characters you love to hate. Rose is like Drago in ""Rocky IV,"" sneering and overconfident, and you can't wait for the inevitable showdown with Abra.

There are plenty of twists and turns along the way, and it all ends up at a familiar place in the Colorado mountains where Dan Torrance never thought he'd return. In keeping with tradition, King sprinkles in plenty of insider references to his fictional universe (Jerusalem's Lot is a favorite hangout for the True Knot, for instance) that will leave fans smiling.

Bottom line: If you loved ""The Shining,"" you'll love catching up with these characters. King is in fine form, making you laugh, grossing you out and spinning a tale that keeps the pages turning. If you've never read King, there are better starter novels in his canon, but you could do a lot worse than a double feature of ""The Shining"" followed by ""Doctor Sleep.""

Yoga: Body and beyond,Corporate whizkids relax with yoga. Patients recoup with it. Weight watchers slim down with it. Worriers chill with it.,['Suma Varughese'],2004-08-16 12:23:00+00:00,"Corporate whizkids relax with yoga. Patients recoup with it. Weight watchers slim down with it. Worriers chill with it. Sages find God with it. The age-old Hatha Yoga system has found new popularity

A T-shirt legend popular in the West goes thus: ""Whatever the question, the answer is… more yoga.""

Yeah, man! From an esoteric science practised in secluded ashrams among a handpicked group of gurus and their acolytes to being brandished on a T-shirt in California is a pretty good gauge of the distance yoga has travelled in the last century.

Today, statistics reveal that yoga is the most widely practised exercise system in the world. One out of eight Americans practises yoga and three lakh people in the UK do likewise.

Hollywood stars like Madonna and Kate Winslet are dedicated yoginis, and it is one of the few terms in the Indian spiritual lexicon that MS Word passes without drawing a red line under.

In the West, yoga and meditation are virtually treated as panaceas to a whole host of physical ailments, including heart conditions ever since Dr Dean Ornish proved that a regimen of yoga, meditation, group therapy and a change in diet could reverse heart conditions.

Books and CDs on the subject abound and websites on yoga are legion. In India, statistics are hard to come by, but every yoga teacher confirms that more and more people, particularly among the younger generation, are turning to yoga.

Collegiate Phiroza Jamula is learning a one-month teacher's training course at the Yoga Institute, Mumbai.

She probably speaks for her generation when she says: ""College life is very stressful because of the pressure to do well, and to handle relationships at home. Through yoga I have learnt how to balance my life.""

Bhumi Trivedi is in her last year of college and simultaneously doing a 7-month teacher's training course in the same institute and is even more emphatic about its benefits in her life: ""Yoga has made me realize that there is much more to life than to eat, drink and be merry. I used to enjoy going out and eating good food. Now, I prefer spending time with my family. Yoga brought more awareness and clarity in me, and my asthma cleared up.""

At the other end of the scale is nonagenarian Sitadevi Yogendra, wife of Shri Yogendra, founder of the Yoga Institute. At 91, she is slim, spry and full of life, all of which she attributes to a regimen of yoga and a simple diet.

Says she: ""I have no complaints. Even my memory is quite good. People should do yoga instead of waiting until they fall sick.""

Institutionalization

Yoga is being taught in schools and colleges. At the Yoga Institute, a hundred school students from the Arya Vidya Mandir were listening attentively to a discourse by the institute's attractive and dynamic Dean, Hansa Jayadeva.

In addition to spending a day at the Yoga Institute, these students learn yoga regularly at their school. Hansaben, as she is called, shows me a sheaf of grateful letters by principals of other schools, acknowledging workshops conducted by the institute and asking for more.

The Bihar School of Yoga (BSY) in Munger is doing sterling work in introducing yoga to children. The Bal Yoga Mitra Mandal is an organization run under their auspices in which children teach other children the intricacies of yoga.

Initially, the children are trained in yoga in their respective schools. Then a select few are trained at BSY as teachers. They return to their schools and conduct classes of their own!

Yoga is an elective subject in all ICSE schools, and Bombay University offers a diploma in yoga.

Spiffy corporate training programmes on stress management revolve around yoga in such companies as Essar and L&T, while Crisil and Infosys have introduced yoga to their in-house fitness programmes.

Clubs, gyms and spas now routinely have yoga in their menu. Jetking Infotrain Ltd., a company that runs technical courses, particularly on computer education, sends all their students for a sponsored two-day workshop at the Yoga Institute, while faculty members are required to attend a seven-day workshop at the same place.

Its CMD, Suresh Bharwani, is an ardent yogi who attributes his focus and concentration to the discipline.

Asanas for beginners Practise on an empty stomach. Wear loose clothing. Spread a yoga mat on the floor. Begin with any warm-up routine. Vajrasana: Knees on the ground, heels apart, sit on the upturned soles of the feet, keeping the body erect and hands on the knees. Paschimotanasana: Sitting with legs together but stretched, bend the trunk forward, trying to touch the knees with the forehead and the feet with hands. Sarvangasana (shoulder stand): Lying down, raise the legs and the waist up straight, balancing the entire body on the neck and the shoulders with hands supporting the small of the back. Halasana (plough posture): In Sarvangasana, bend the legs backward so that eventually the toes of the feet touch the floor behind. Bhujangasana (cobra): Lying face downward, keep the hands on the ground, and raise the trunk as much as you can. Shalabhasana (locust): Lying face downward, keep the chin on the ground and raise the legs, with thighs supported by hands. Ardhamatsyendrasana (twist): While sitting, with left leg folded on the ground, move the right foot next to the knee and twist the trunk and head to the left. Then, reverse the legs. Padahastasana: While standing, bend forward without bending the knees, moving the head towards the knees, and hands trying to touch the floor. Shavasana: Always end with this relaxing position. Lying prone on the floor, keep the legs apart, a foot between the two feet, and arms a little away from the body. Keep eyes closed. While doing asanas, keep the movements slow and flowing. Never overdo beyond your capacity. Stay in a posture as much as you can before returning to the rest position.

Says he: ""In 1979, my father died suddenly. I went to Jayadeva Yogendra, the head of the Yoga Institute, and asked him, 'Yesterday, he was wearing nice clothes, and today, where has he gone?'""

Since then a philosophical understanding of death has gone hand-in hand with a robust zest for life. The yogic training has increased the effectiveness of his staff members. Says he: ""When they return from the workshop many are so grateful that they fall at my feet.""



Jetking, the Rs 39-crore company, with 60 centres across India, takes a 10-minute break every day, across the board, in which everyone chants Om.

""I link our prosperity to the cultivation of right values,"" says Bharwani.

Hospitals are using yoga as a way of helping patients recover not just physical well-being but also to inculcate a positive attitude. I visit the Indian Cancer Society in Parel.

Here, cancer patients are rehabilitated not just in terms of coming to terms with their condition but given livelihood opportunities. They are also taught yoga by teachers from the Ambika Yog Kutir.

It is a moving spectacle to see these patients, some emaciated, others visibly scarred, closing their eyes and folding their hands reverentially for the opening prayer.

Dr Satish Pathak, a surgeon and the moving spirit behind the initiative, says: ""Many of the patients are healthier and more energetic since we started the programme four months ago.""

This is an assertion which the Director of the Society, Kalpana Venkataraman, enthusiastically endorses.

Says Dr Pathak: ""If a child is not given the right sanskar, he becomes a vagabond. Similarly, through yoga, we are trying to give sanskar to the vagabond cells that are cancerous.""

Alka Ghandat, 28, looks like a 10-year-old, a phenomenon caused by the brain tumour she battled which stunted her growth.

She giggles as she admits: ""Earlier, I used to feel nervous. Yoga has helped me overcome that.""

Santosh Purab, who has just recovered from an operation for cheekbone cancer, says: ""After the operation I used to feel very tired. Now I feel fresh.""

Fresh is a word most patients use to express their state of being. Many have been rid of colds, acidity and depression since. The Yoga Institute runs a cardiac workshop for patients with remarkable results.

Reveals Hansaben: ""The change in outlook is the main cause for the healing. The 32-year-old son of one of our heart patients died recently of an accident. Earlier, he may have suffered another heart attack. But today, he is philosophical and has accepted the son's death, and only feels grateful for his own life.""

AIDS patients have been helped by the institute's former students in America, while slow learners and the physically challenged have all benefited from using yoga.

At the Kripa Foundation De-addiction Centre in Bandra, run by Father Joe Perreira, a student of BKS Iyengar, addicts are taught yoga and meditation besides the 12-point Alcoholic Anonymous Programme. The results are excellent, for the Centre boasts of a recovery rate of 69 per cent.

Father Joe also teaches yoga to a group of largely Christian practitioners.

At all nature cure sanatoriums, such as Jindal's farm in Bangalore, yoga is considered part of the regimen. It is also closely aligned to ayurveda. Most spiritual ashrams and meditation programmes include some aspect of yoga in their regimen.

For instance, the popular Art of Living course employs a series of pranayamas.

Siddha Samadhi Yoga of Rishi Prabhakar uses a combination of pranayama, asanas, natural food as well as the higher reaches of mind control and spiritual realization.

Brahma Vidya, another popular programme, uses a series of healing breaths coupled with affirmations and meditation.

It would be correct to say that the two disciplines underwiring India's spiritual civilization are yoga and its ally, meditation. The two together form our most popular export item, and are perhaps the premier transforming agents in the world today.

Says management consultant Kartik Vyas, who started his training career with a yoga-based workshop: ""People are looking for greater direction and purpose in life. They are realizing that solutions cannot be piecemeal. The answer is yoga, which does not neglect any aspect of our lives and integrates it. It is also non-sectarian.""

Adds Parmanand Aggarwal, secretary of Kaivalyadhama in Mumbai: ""Today, yoga is necessary for practical life. Modern medicines carry side-effects. Yoga not just takes care of the body but also the mind.''

A complete routine If you cannot find time to do yogasanas, Surya Namaskar is a good substitute, as it takes a few minutes only. Surya, the sun, is the central source of energy in our solar system. Its warmth, brilliance and purity takes the form of vital life energy on Earth. Surya Namaskar, or Salutation to the Sun, is a sequence of 12 asanas, to draw in peace, harmony and strength in the body. In the initial stages, try to coordinate the steps with breathing. Once you are comfortable with the flow of the asanas, awareness of the chakras and mantra recitation can be incorporated. You may start with three rounds and gradually build up the stamina for 10 to 12 rounds. Practise at the pace you feel comfortable with. If you feel tired at any stage, rest. Gradually your system will gain strength and you will be able to perform these exercises almost effortlessly. Ideally, these exercises should be performed early in the morning, exposing your body to the sun’s rays. Surya Namaskar helps fight ageing and rejuvenates the entire body. Its practice also nurtures the higher emotions of love, peace and compassion. The practice of Surya Namaskar 1. Exhale and fold your hands in front of your chest. 2. Inhale deeply and raise your hands up and stretch backwards with your eyes open. Hold for a few seconds and gently move into the next step. 3. Exhale and bend down completely to touch the floor with the palms of your hands. 4. Inhale and bend the left leg while stretching the right leg backward with your toes and knees touching the ground. Look up. 5. Retain the breath, move the other leg back and lift both knees off the ground. The heels, hips, head move in one line, in a push up position. 6. Exhale and bring your body to the ground. Only eight parts of the body—two feet, two knees, two hands, chest and forehead—touch the ground. The abdominal region is raised. 7. Inhale while slowly raising your trunk, straighten the arms and bend your head backwards. 8. Exhale and form an inverted ‘V’ as in step 5. 9. Inhale and come down into the posture at step 4, bending the right leg and stretching the left. 10. Exhale and raise your body into the bending position as in step 3. 11. Inhale and raise yourself completely, stretching backwards as in step 2. 12. Exhale and bring your hands down. This concludes one round of Surya Namaskar.





Origins

There is a fascinating myth about the origin of yoga, which is popularly attributed to Lord Shiva.

According to the book Shiva, An Introduction by Devdutt Patnaik, Shiva was very disturbed by the state of Brahma's world, rife as it was with avarice, envy, hate and misery, with only a few glimpses of pleasure to keep creatures moving from life to life.



Railing against the maya that ensnared man in an eternal cycle of birth and death, he vowed to find a way out. Repairing to Kashi, he strove to control his mind, and to rise above the illusions of life and penetrate its underlying truth.

Through this tapasya emerged yoga, the system that yokes man with his creator through rising above the pleasures and pain of material life and earning him eternal salvation.

Sitting under a banyan tree, facing the south, Shiva freely gave of his knowledge to all who yearned for moksha.

It is said that apart from creating the other seven limbs of yoga, he manipulated his body into 8,40,000 ways, each representing a different bird or beast, which form the body of yoga asanas.

Shiva is also known as the Adi Guru and is saluted by all yogis. That yoga is of ancient origin, there is no doubt.

In the ancient civilization of Mohenjodaro, dating back to 2300 to 2000 BC, there is a sculpture of a man sitting in meditation. It has been mentioned in the Rig Veda, considered to be the oldest sacred text in any Indo-Euorpean language.

But its modern form owes much to the sage Patanjai who codified the yoga philosophy and practices under the title Yoga Sutra around 200 A.D.

Yoga, semantically, means to yoke (yug) one thing to another; it links the body, mind and spirit, and finally God.

Such a broad definition means that yoga stands for any technique or technology that integrates and brings together man and God.

Thus under this broad umbrella term come the three self-realization measures mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita: Karma Yoga, Jnana Yoga and Bhakti Yoga.

There is also Mantra Yoga, Laya Yoga and Tantra Yoga. Closer to our interest is the classic path of Raja Yoga and Hatha Yoga.

Raja Yoga, the royal path, is the practice of the ashtanga (eight limbs) yoga prescribed by Patanjali in his Yoga Sutras.

These eight limbs together move the practitioner from the adoption of a moral code (yama and niyama) to the practice of physical exercises (asanas) and breathing (pranayama), leading to the higher realms of controlling the mind through the practice of pratyahara, (withdrawal of the senses), dharana, (one-pointedness), dhyana (meditation), and finally samadhi (union with the divine).

Raja Yoga is a comprehensive programme for self-realization that has seldom been bettered and is comparable with the Buddha's eight-fold path.

One of the key differences between the two, however, is the inclusion of physical exercise, asanas, in the former.

For the casual observer and even practitioner of yoga, it is this aspect that dominates attention.

The identikit picture of a yogi is, after all, of someone tied up in intricate knots. Such an idea does not do justice to the profound thought behind a discipline that is considered one of the six mystical paths of Indian philosophy.

The others being Sankhya, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Vedanta and Mimamsa. There is, however, one form of yoga in which asanas take pride of place and that is Hatha Yoga. Ha stands for the sun and tha for the moon.

Together, they represent the flow of breath in the right and left nostrils. The left is traditionally associated with the moon and is connected with the pingala, one of the three premier nadis that spiral up the spine, orchestrating the flow of prana in the body, and the right with the ida, the second of the nadis. These two coil around the central nadi, the sushumna.

Hatha Yoga is the preparatory stage for the movement into the majesty of Raja Yoga, but it can also be seen as a full-fledged spiritual path in its own right.

Through control of the prana, the vital energy in the incoming breath and the apana, the outgoing breath, as well as through the practice of asanas, bandhas (locks), mudras (seals) and kriyas (cleansing practices) that compose the discipline, one can reach a state where the breath itself stops.

This stage, called Kevala Kumbhaka, occurs only when the prana enters the sushumna and the mind is steady. In the Hatha Yoga Pradapika, a 17th century classic text on Hatha Yoga, written by Yogi Swatmarama, there is a likeness drawn between the aim of Raja Yoga, chitta vritti nirodha, the stilling of the mind, to Hatha Yoga's stilling of the breath.

Both occur only when the practitioner is purified and ready for enlightenment. Kundalini Yoga is an extension of Hatha, which also propels the aspirant towards self-realization.

A package of special breathing exercises and asanas help the ascent of the Kundalini shakti (the legendary serpent power considered to be the index of spiritual awakening) up the sushumna all the way to the sahasrara (the crown chakra).

This is considered to be the state of enlightenment, the physical equivalent of the state of samadhi which is the apex of Raja Yoga. In this article we are concerned with the domain of Hatha Yoga, its popularity and growth, its various derivatives, its practice and practitioners.

A vast field of study in itself. And the reason for its selection is not out of lack of respect for Raja Yoga or a deprecation of the full potential of the yogic path, but because it is worthwhile looking at Hatha Yoga too, which has seen a worldwide popularity.

Hatha Yoga is said to have its origin in a discourse by Shiva to his consort, Parvati. It is the most popular form of physical exercise in the whole world, particularly in the West where it is considered in many pockets to be primarily a physical exercise for body betterment.

Even within the framework of this limited understanding its benefits are manifold. It tones and limbers the body by stretching muscles. It regulates weight and sustains youthfulness.

Says Uma Ghaisas, a teacher at Mumbai's Kaivalyadhama yoga centre: ""I lost 10 kilos in the first year of doing yoga 16 years back, and I have not regained that weight.""

It maintains health and dissolves disease. Jehangir Palkhivala, who has been teaching Iyengar Yoga for many years, reveals that he has managed to heal patients of many ailments including thyroid problem, chronic lower back pain, diabetes, all kinds of enlargements and even the regeneration of the body, such as turning grey hair black.

Says Palkhivala: ""My most satisfying case was that of two young women, recently married who had a problem called endometriosis, which is a painful condition of internal bleeding. Both agreed to go on urine fasts, eat only raw food, and do specific asanas. In two months, their condition had cleared up.""

Says Ramchandra Surve, a trustee of the Ambika Yog Kutir, a Thane-based yoga centre which teaches yoga free of cost and has 45 centres: ""We have had good results with blood pressure, migraine, sinus, and dysentery.""

Dr Pathak furnishes a summary of the condition of their cardiac patients which indicates that 63 per cent have achieved over 50 per cent relief in their condition.



Almost all practitioners report some physical benefit, most common being clearing up of cold and coughs, relief from headaches and migraines, sinusitis and asthma.

Says Sarla Barolia who is doing yoga for the last 10 years at Kaivalyadhama: ""I had a cyst and heavy bleeding, all of which has stopped. Today I feel very healthy.""

It also controls stress.

Julie Baruah, a teacher in King George School, Dadar, and doing a month-long teacher's training course at the Yoga Institute, acknowledges: ""My anger is a little in control. I now remain calm at least the first two times after my children get into mischief. Even they have noticed it and they ask me: 'Why have you become a yogi?'""

Kiran Shukla, a housewife doing the same course, admits: ""Earlier, my concentration was very low and everything, including the maid's absence, would flummox me. Now, when I get stressed, I do breathing exercises.""

Falguni Shah, a young teacher at a school called Kangaroo Kids, used yoga to emerge from depression. Says she: ""Earlier, I used to be impulsive and impatient. I have much more self-control now.""

And it leads to a higher level of awareness and peace.

Mahesh Ramchandani, a writer for magazines and TV serials, says: ""There's a newfound calmness and peace within me, which has transformed the way I do things and how I relate to people.""

Mita Naik, a nutritionist, believes that yoga has awakened her spiritually and boosted her confidence levels. She adds: ""I can handle any situation today. My mother, who is a diabetic, suddenly found her blood sugar dropping to the extent that she became catatonic. My dad was petrified, but I handled the problem without getting disturbed.""

Yoga's uses are virtually endless. It can help with pregnancy and with menopause.

Says freelance journalist Sameera Khan, who learns Iyengar Yoga and has recently given birth to a baby girl: ""I did yoga almost right through my pregnancy and it helped me tremendously.""

It can help handle the stress at work as well as control the deleterious effects of spending long hours peering into a computer console. It can help build relationships and create harmony within and without.

Says Palkhivala: ""It's very satisfying when I hear one of the practitioners saying 'I've changed the way I speak to my mother-in-law.'""

In short, yoga can help transform every part of a human being's life, and if enough people do it, it can transform the globe. So perhaps doing yoga is a social duty you owe to the Universe!

Hatha Yoga practices

Hatha Yoga consists of asanas, pranayama, bandhas, kriyas and mudras.

Asanas: These are the physical postures of yoga. There is an unlimited variety to draw from. Each yoga school will have its own repertoire unique to them.

According to the Hatha Yoga Pradapika, asanas make one firm, free of disease and light of limb. It is achieved by eliminating the rajas guna that creates instability and fickleness of the mind, and the tamas guna that creates heaviness in the body.

Asanas also activate various nerve centers, that brings balance to the body and, more importantly, the mind.

In her book, the Keep It Simple Series (KISS) Guide to Yoga, American Shakta Kaur Khalsa adds that the inclusion of conscious breathing with the asanas circulates energy and blood and brings balance to the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.

Asanas are grouped according to their stance, i.e. sitting, standing, lying down, etc. Different asanas create different effects, and therefore each condition has to be treated with specific asanas. This includes not just the treatment of physical ailments but also to generate specific qualities of the mind.

Management consultant Kartik Vyas runs a workshop on the four sattvic values of dharma (laws of life), gyan (knowledge), vairagya (detachment) and aishwarya (self-efficacy) which he substantiates with specific asanas.

Pranayama: Pranayama is the art of conscious breathing. Breath control is the key to the control of prana, or subtle energy, that coasts through our system and is the source of our life force.

When we control prana and direct its flow, we can consciously move it away from the senses and towards the inner landscape.

Thus we can consciously overcome our attraction to and repulsion of the material world, and rein in the wavering, fluctuating mind. The yogis understood that the mind and the breath pattern were intimately connected.

Anger and strong emotions generate agitated and quick breathing. As the breathing gets longer and slower, the mind calms down in equal proportion. Through pranayama, the mind learns to become still.

By slowing down the breath, the yogi extends his life expectancy, for he expends less energy. There are three stages in pranayama.

The first is the rechaka, the exhalation, then the puraka, inhalation and the kumbhaka, retention. It is advisable to make the exhalation longer than the inhalation, and many pranayamas lead with exhalation.

Kumbhaka is the retention of breath between the inhalations and exhalations and should be practised cautiously. As the practitioner becomes more comfortable with the idea he should increase the period of retention.

All teachers emphasise that pranayama must be learnt by a teacher or it can have deleterious effects. There are various types of pranayama. One of the most elementary is anuloma viloma, or alternate nostril breathing.

Here inhalation happens through one nostril and exhalation through the other, alternating the nostrils with each breath.

Another is Ujjayi. Here you contract your glottis so that the breathing happens from behind your throat, making a guttural sound.

Ujjayi is a tranquillising breath, which soothes the nervous system and calms the mind.

Bhastrika, also called the bellows breath, requires one to breathe rapidly and forcefully. The other breaths are surya bheda, sitkari, sitali, brahmari, moorcha, and plavini.

Bandhas: Bandhas, meaning locks, are movements that contract the muscles internally, helping to re-channel prana, and generating concentration and internal heat. These are advanced yogic practices and require the guidance of a teacher to practise.

The Mula bandha (root lock) contracts the perenium and perineal muscles, located between the anus and genitals. The Uddiyana bandha (diaphragm lock) is focused on the navel which is drawn inward and upward.

The Jalandara bandha, or neck lock, draws the chin towards the throat. The Maha bandha, or great lock is when all three are applied together.

Kriyas: The kriyas are six cleansing practices that clean the body internally. These are dhauti, basti, neti, tratak, nauli, and kapalabhati.

Dhauti requires a long strip of clean cloth, about 15 feet long and four fingers broad. Slowly swallow it according to the instructions of the guru. Start with a span and increase by a span daily.

Draw it out again.

This practice cures asthma, splenetic diseases, leprosy and other diseases brought on by phlegm. Basti takes care of digestive problems and increases the body's digestive fire. It is a form of enema.

Water is drawn into the anus through a small bamboo tube, retained for a while and discharged. Neti takes care of respiratory problems, purifies the skull and enhances sight.

It is a most useful practice in these days of heavy air pollution. Using a neti pot, that has a long nozzle, lukewarm salted water is poured through one nostril and taken out from the other and vice versa.

Tratak means to focus on an object, usually the flame of a candle, without blinking, until tears appear in the eyes. Tratak removes all illnesses of the eye and also eliminates sloth.

Nauli is done by looking down at the feet, and turning the intestines to the right and to the left, with the slow motion of a small eddy in the river. It increases gastric fire, enhances digestive powers and destroys all diseases caused by vata, kapha or pitta.

Kapalbhati is the rapid inhalation and exhalation of the breath, which is excellent for respiratory problems.

Caution: Bandhas and kriyas must be learnt and practised under expert guidance.

Mudras: Like other aspects of Hatha Yoga, they also regulate the flow of prana. These powerful but gentle finger movements can heal diseases and create valuable positive states of mind. Mudras use the principle of acupressure by pressing specific parts of the hand for specific effects.

In Gyan mudra, for instance, you press the thumb and index fingers, while keeping the other three fingers upright. Its practice ensures mental peace, concentrations, and sharp memory. It cures insomnia and dissipates tension and depression.

Apan vayu mudra: Fold the forefinger down and touch the mound of the thumb. Bring together the tips of the middle finger, ring finger and the thumb. Keep the little finger upright. This position regulates complications of the heart.

In a severe heart attack, if administered within the first two seconds, it can give relief.

Pran mudra: Bring together the tips of the ring finger, little finger and thumb lightly. Keep the other two fingers upright. This mudra enhances the life force and helps improve eyesight.

Apan mudra: Join the tips of the middle and ring finger to the tip of the thumb. Hold the forefinger and little finger upright. This mudra provides relief from urinary problems and eases difficulty in labour and delivery.

Who can do yoga?

Just anyone can! Age and physical condition are no bar, for yoga believes in adapting itself to the practitioner.

Besides, its slow, gentle movements, while providing internal strength and pull, make it accessible to most people. Yes, some of its movements are challenging and require flexibility but the whole idea behind yoga is to build up the flexibility over time, at a pace adjusted to individual capability.

If you wish to learn yoga, it is best to join a class, instead of trying to learn through a book at home. Yoga is tricky because of the focus on the breath even while doing asanas and you might damage yourself if you do not learn the discipline well. A class will also force you to be regular.

We all know how easy it is to slip and default when we do it at home. Stay with a class until you have sufficient proficiency and have learnt to enjoy its benefits too well to give it up before going solo.

Yoga is usually practised early in the morning or in the evening. Avoid eating anything for at least two hours before practice. Eat only half-an-hour after practice. Drink plenty of water after a session, because it will help eliminate the toxins that are stirred up.

When practising at home, choose a calm secluded spot with plenty of light and air. Stay with the practice. Don't give up. Its benefits, as practitioners will testify, are precious and can take you all the way to self-realization!

‘My 15-year-old son hit me. Am I bad parent?’: Let’s talk about teenage violence,"In Part 2 of our series, #LetsTalkAboutTeenageViolence, torn between maternal love and violence, a mother dreads she might end up as a newspaper headline that screams ‘Mother killed by son’.",[],2018-03-20 07:48:00+00:00,"I do not want to become another newspaper headline that screams ‘Mother killed by son.’ I do not want to see my husband kill himself. I am desperately trying to save my son from turning into a hardened criminal.

For the last 18 months, my husband and I have been suffering at the hands of our 15-year-old boy, who abuses us physically and mentally each time we refuse to give in to his unreasonable demands.

Which mother would like to call the police to report her own son? I was forced to call the police on multiple occasions. In January, a mere refusal by us to buy him a new smart phone led him to smash his old mobile on my forehead.

He then rained blows on my face with both fists.

Part 1 | Let’s talk about teenage violence: ‘I am a 15-year-old accused of murder’

I narrowly escaped turning blind in one eye and needed several stitches on my forehead. I always saw my son as an innocent boy, but there was not a hint of regret or guilt in his eyes. He abused us in front of the police team.

Our son turned 15 in December. He drinks alcohol regularly and takes our car out for joyrides. He has crossed various lines. He has procured a fake government identity proof and wants to build a future using fake mark sheets.

I am afraid that my teenage son’s violent behaviour may soon lead to serious offences. His behaviour has shattered the false notion I nurtured that juvenile criminals belong only to the poorer classes of society. He studies in one of the best schools in Delhi and lives with us in a tony South Delhi address.

Our son is an only child. I love him dearly but I must confess that I have thought about having him arrested and not bailing him out.

I am a desperate mother who is not sure of how to deal with her teenage son’s violence.

Our son was not always like this. Two years ago, he was a cycling enthusiast who also excelled in football and basketball at school. He did well in academics at the prestigious school.

Today, his bicycle gathers dust in one corner of our duplex home. He has replaced his cricket and football teammates with a bunch of older boys who give him company in illegal joyrides and drinking sessions. He has not studied a word in several months and hardly attends school any more.

Should we move our son to a hostel? Will that help discipline him? Questions keep popping into my head; the answers to which are always elusive. He found out about the hostel plan and threatened to harm us. At home, he uses violence as a way of getting what he wants. Other members of the extended family shield their children from our son, now seen as a bad influence.

We are a well-to-do business family. We have struggled and worked hard to live the comfortable life we lead. In a city where nuclear families are the norm, we live in a joint family along with my husband’s parents and his brother’s family.

Our son is our flesh and blood. Did we contribute to what he is today? We brought him up with great love and gave him all he wanted. Maybe we are guilty of not drawing any lines; of not striking the right balance, of not teaching him the value of money.

How do children suddenly turn on their parents? The problems with our son began to manifest themselves in mid-2016. Till then, he was a good student but in class eight, his marks started dropping from the 90s to the 50s. I checked and found that he had not been attending school regularly. He had also left the cycling club he had enrolled in and had begun drinking.

At home, he doesn’t take no for an answer. One violent tantrum gives way to another. He has started smashing the crockery and breaking mobile phones. Had he fallen into the wrong company, we asked ourselves, and moved him to another school.

Our son has turned more aggressive. He is still years away from getting a valid driving license, but our Honda City car has become his. He drinks and drives. My husband can smell alcohol in the car.

I am worried that he will soon be in an accident that could hurt him and others. I live in constant fear of my husband being booked for letting a minor drive. In November last year, he crashed into another car. We managed to get away by paying off the other driver and spending Rs 2.25 lakh to repair our car. I know it is only a matter of time before he crashes into another vehicle.

When we confront him, or try to deter him from driving, he doesn’t think twice before beating us up. Left with little choice, I arranged a driver for him. The two have now become a team and our son won’t let us change the driver.

We pay Rs 500 every day for petrol expenses. In addition, our son takes between Rs 40,000 and 50,000 as monthly pocket money that is spent in pubs with friends.

At night, he uses a spare key to sneak out of the house to go meet his friends. I don’t know what he is up to. May be I should hire a private detective. I am emotionally drained. Our son uses us as an ATM and the house as a hotel.

He refers to his father as ‘yaar’. My husband is a mild-mannered and kind man and our son exploits that. I try to put up a brave front and counter him but am afraid of his thrashings. My husband has even contemplated suicide.

We have knocked on several doors to try and help our son.

Senior police officers have given us a patient hearing and have instructed the local police to counsel him. Our son refused to visit the police station, compelling the officers to visit our home instead. He sweet talks the officers into believing he is a victim of high expectations from us.

We have taken our son to counsellors and psychologists in the city but that hasn’t helped either. Last November, we convinced him to get admitted into the psychiatric department of a top private hospital for 10 days. Within two days, our son was back to his violent ways.

His teachers appear happy he doesn’t attend school regularly because they feel they have less trouble to deal with. The teachers are afraid of complaining about him. He has been involved in violence at school where he has beaten up other students and got beaten himself.

I am constantly haunted by the question: have I been a bad parent?. I don’t know the road ahead. Should we be blamed if someday he is caught for a crime? I am helpless and scared of ending up as a newspaper headline.

"Global Vice Index: Cigarettes, alcohol cheapest in Luxembourg, most expensive in Ukraine","Americans had to fork out over $200 more for a basket of so-called vice goods last year versus 2016, with only New Zealand seeing a bigger increase.",[],2018-04-04 15:56:00+00:00,"The cost of maintaining a drugs, booze and cigarettes habit got a lot more expensive in the U.S. last year, rising the most of almost anywhere in the world, the annual Bloomberg Global Vice Index shows.

Americans had to fork out over $200 more for a basket of so-called vice goods last year versus 2016, with only New Zealand seeing a bigger increase. The gauge compares the share of income needed to maintain a broad weekly habit of cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, amphetamines, cocaine and opioids across more than 100 countries. Doing so eats up more than a third of the average weekly paycheck in more than three quarters of the economies tracked, the index shows.

The gauge is purely an economic indicator, not a judgment about morality or legality. Nor does it track gambling, prostitution or other illicit activities.

Vice is cheapest in Luxembourg, where the cost comes in at less than 10 percent of the $2,071 average weekly wage, which is the highest in the world. The Bahamas, Switzerland, Iceland and France round out the top five for affordability.

Vice is cheapest in Luxembourg, where the cost comes in at less than 10 percent of the $2,071 average weekly wage, which is the highest in the world. The Bahamas, Switzerland, Iceland and France round out the top five for affordability.

By contrast, Ukrainians must spend 13 times their weekly salary for the same fix, making it one of the costliest places for those making local wages. Pakistan, Nepal and Burkina Faso also score near the top for higher prices. The vice indicator uses U.S. prices as the global benchmark. At 54 percent of pay, or $617, U.S. ranked 38 in terms of affordability, compared with 17 a year earlier.

Online Sales

In absolute terms, the gross weekly cost exceeded $1,000 in only three countries: Japan, New Zealand and Australia. By comparison, an equivalent basket ran less than $100 in 21 mostly tropical countries, including the Dominican Republic, Ghana, Congo, Colombia, South Africa, Guatemala, Kenya and Myanmar.

While laws remain a key factor for narcotics prices, those dynamics may be in flux as more drug sales move online. The new avenues make some drug markets less risky as they let users “buy drugs with a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, and have their purchases delivered to them in a concealed manner,” the United Nations 2017 World Drug Report says.

“Something like Bitcoin has appealed to dealers because it’s anonymous,” said Jonathan Caulkins, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and former co-director of RAND’s Drug Policy Research Center. “Banking creates a trail that they don’t want.”

Shadow Economy

Vice prices tumbled the most in Iran, Norway and South Korea, all of which saw the weekly tab for the basket of drugs, alcohol and tobacco fall by more than $200 from the prior year.

The difficulty in collecting data on illegal activity means survey responses often have a lag, which makes comparisons harder. As a result, nations with missing data weren’t included in the overall index and those with data had wide estimated ranges.

This year’s Bloomberg Vice Index also included the size of the “shadow” drug economy in different regions by approximating the retail value of narcotics seized by law enforcement.

Like other businesses, retail-wholesale pricing dynamics and supply-chain management are the keys to efficiency. “A shadow economy, or underground economy, is run as an efficient business like the official one,” said Friedrich Schneider, an economics professor at Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria.

Competitive Cannabis

On markups for narcotics prices, “cannabis markets tend to be more competitive in most countries, especially because it is frequently produced locally,” according to Manolis Galenianos, an economics professor at Royal Holloway University of London.

“Cocaine and opioids, by contrast, have to be imported from abroad, which requires a much higher level of sophistication and is, therefore, done by only a few organizations,” leading to more concentrated markets and higher markups, Galenianos said.

Bloomberg’s vice basket tracks average retail prices for: A pack of cigarettes, popular and premium A bottle of alcoholic beverages including beer, wine and spirits A gram of amphetamine-type stimulants, including methamphetamine and/or ecstasy A gram of cannabis, including marijuana hashish resin and/or cannabis oil A gram of cocaine, regardless of salts, paste or base forms A gram of opioids, including heroin and/or opium.

Data are sourced from the UN, World Health Organization, World Bank and International Monetary Fund.

Why an openly gay PM such as Leo Varadkar is an impossibility in India,"There are no openly gay politicians in India, mainly because non-normative sexual or gender orientation is considered a death knell for one’s career",[],2017-06-03 13:42:00+00:00,"January 2015, Dublin, Ireland: The country’s health minister Leo Varadkar has just made history by coming out as gay on a live national radio broadcast. “It’s just part of who I am…it is a part of my character,” he says, months before Ireland votes in a landmark referendum to legalise same-sex marriage.

January 2015, Panaji, India: Goa youth affairs minister Ramesh Tawadkar has just declared setting up “gay cure” centres to deal with homosexual youth. “We will make them normal. Like Alcoholic Anonymous centres, we will train them and (give them) medicines,” he says.

India woke up on Saturday to celebrate the success of Leo Varadkar, the son of a Mumbai doctor who rose to become Ireland’s youngest prime minister. But among the adulations showered on the 38-year-old lies one deliberate omission: The shameful way in which Indian society and political leadership treats it Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender (LGBT) population.

The challenges of living queer in India are well documented. LGBT folks are shut out of our education and employment institutions, and pushed out of housing and public spaces. To be out or present non-normatively is to often invite ridicule, bias and outright violence. And if one is poor, or lower-caste or disabled and is queer, they stop existing not just in collective memory but also for public policy.

But a far more insidious form of discrimination flies under the radar: The refusal of our political leadership to discuss, let alone reform, India’s outdated laws that outlaw homosexual people and criminalise the lives of LGBT folks.

Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code has been on the national agenda for at least a decade and half now, since activists approached the Delhi High Court to read down the provisions of the colonial statute. But in these 16 years, not once has the government of the day or the political leadership taken up the cause of people who are among the most marginalised sections of society.

In 2013, when the Supreme Court sounded out Parliament to read down section 377, the political leadership ducked. Two years later, a majority of lawmakers blocked even any discussion on a bill brought by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor to scrap the section. Despite intermittent comments by leaders of the ruling party, and apparent attempts at sounding progressive, little has moved on a basic human rights issue that most parts of the world have resolved. The government seems content on passing the buck to the judiciary, apparently paralysed by the fear of offending sections of the population obsessed with cows.

This toxic concoction of opportunism and apathy is why a Leo Varadkar is impossible in India – an ironic situation considering we regularly elect repeat offenders, people accused of rape and murder who blithely suspend investigations against themselves when in power. We look the other way when suspects, even convicts, enter Parliament. As a nation that seems to have little problem with leaders accused of embezzlement, corruption or murder, a person being gay should be the least of our concerns.

But there are no openly gay politicians in India, and the few transgender representatives have found it difficult to break into larger than a local arena – mainly because non-normative sexual or gender orientation is considered a death knell for one’s career.

Varadkar has presented himself as any other politician to be judged on the merit of his policy -- and there are problems, say, with his position on immigration reform or housing. But in that appraisal, his sexual orientation is increasingly faint as a factor —something unimaginable in our society.

Varadkar’s election isn’t an event to celebrate for Indians. It is a moment of introspection on how we have systematically disenfranchised a section of our country. Leo Varadkar only has his father to be grateful to, not his country of origin that would have made him a criminal. Thank god he left India.

Workaholics anonymous,"I have never been in favour of addiction of any kind, be it a substance (including tea and coffee), habit or even gadgets. But as the saying goes 'diye tale andhera', I didn't realise that my work was gradually turning into an obsession and I was transforming into a hardcore alcoholic, workaholic that is. Parminder Kaur writes",['Parminder Kaur'],2013-07-09 10:11:00+00:00,"I have never been in favour of addiction of any kind, be it a substance (including tea and coffee), habit or even gadgets. But as the saying goes 'diye tale andhera', I didn't realise that my work was gradually turning into an obsession and I was transforming into a hardcore alcoholic, workaholic that is. Believe me, workaholism is a form of extreme addiction, a progressive disease with very detrimental bearing on one's physical and psychological well-being.



Literally speaking, a workaholic is the one addicted to work, not a hard worker rather a compulsive worker. A workaholic can't sit idle, relax and just be. Being busy is the drug that gives him/her a high. Not working induces guilt pangs, resentment and self-wallowing. Just like other addictions it has its symptoms and red herrings. For better understanding of this ailment, let me play my story in flashback (yes filmy style).

I jumped on to the job wagon right after graduation, as I was keener to earn than learn. Soon I was flying high on wings of financial independence; yes that's the initial stage of this addiction. Next was the adrenaline rush begot by resolving crises, meeting project deadlines and achieving job targets. Still, I was a borderline case and dared to take a break and even experiment with a vocational change.

Marriage and a baby brought along more responsibilities and from a workaholic perspective, more challenges. Personally and professionally, I had many roles to live up to and each one became by dope for further addiction. As if not enough, I pursued my master's degree in this melee. Multitasking is not bad but when it becomes the only benchmark of your worth, then it spells trouble.

Finally, work was getting better of me. Holidays made me anxious and bored. I needed something to do all the time, even at the cost of my health and mental serenity.

And then something happened that changed my life, for better or worse, both in fact. I was almost immobilised by a massive disc prolapse and the workaholic in me was forced into a prolonged rehabilitation. Was it destiny or my doing? After all I had been ignoring the forewarnings. What followed was unbearably painful, physically and emotionally. Even a drug addict is weaned off drugs gradually but here I was, not able to even walk properly let alone work. Thanks to family support and therapy, the physical pain subsided and I got back to a better though restrictive lifestyle.

Now I had a bigger demon to fight, the withdrawal symptoms of this unsolicited de-addiction. I suffered terrible mood swings, feeling guilty of not doing anything worthwhile. But then, this cloud too had a silver lining.

For once I was not running a race and living life at my own pace, spending quality time with loved ones. I rediscovered my passion for writing and found the joy of selective working rather than compulsive. The rehabilitation process still continues for me.

Lesson learnt: Work we must, for that is worship and imperative also in today's competitive world. But life sustains and flourishes on balance, not excesses. Only you can decide what your threshold is. Slow down or burn out? Make a choice before it's too late.

Unnamed ‘Oxygen Thief’ become self-published success,"The fair-skinned man with the hoodie and dark ski cap sits on a bench outside McNally Jackson Books in downtown Manhattan, where neither patrons nor employees seem aware that he’s the author of a work so in demand at the store that it’s often out of stock.",[],2016-05-24 12:46:00+00:00,"

The fair-skinned man with the hoodie and dark ski cap sits on a bench outside McNally Jackson Books in downtown Manhattan, where neither patrons nor employees seem aware that he’s the author of a work so in demand at the store that it’s often out of stock.

Known to his growing fan base as “Anonymous,” he has given us one of the more unusual self-published successes: “Diary of an Oxygen Thief,” a 147-page fictionalized memoir, or autobiographical novel, depending on how much of this story of a recovering alcoholic and the damage he has inflicted and absorbed you care to believe.

“It has an unusual negative space,” says the author, who on email uses the names Tom Wilkinson and Stanley Easyday and prefers to be identified as O2Thief. “It couldn’t be more naked, but at the same time ... ‘Who the hell is it?’ I think it’s a very powerful place to write.”

Some books catch on immediately, others take their time, but “Oxygen Thief” has really followed the scenic route. First published by the author in 2006, the book has slipped on and off the charts ever since, apparently dependent on the occasional tweet or other online comment. “Oxygen Thief” has been such a homegrown operation that the author not only served as his own editor and cover designer, but has also sold the book in the streets and would personally ship it to retailers, sometimes taking on orders for thousands of copies.

His workload is about to lighten. This year, “Oxygen Thief” cracked the top 20 on both Amazon.com and iTunes, enough to interest literary agent Byrd Leavell and eventually a publisher, Gallery Books, a pop culture imprint of Simon & Schuster that plans to release an e-edition this week and a paper version in mid-June. (Film rights have been acquired by Gotham Group.)

“I monitor the Amazon top 100 regularly, and while many self-published titles make a brief appearance there, a persistent best-seller commands special attention,” said Gallery executive editor Jeremie Ruby-Strauss, whose authors have included Tucker Max, Ace Frehley and Grace Jones.

Douglas Singleton, a buyer and manager at McNally Jackson, said the store has sold more than 200 copies of “Oxygen Thief,” the in-house record for a “consignment order.” Asked if he has met the author, Singleton said he wasn’t sure. He thinks the man who delivers copies of “Oxygen Thief” is the book’s writer, but it’s been a couple of years since he’s seen him.

“We’ve often talked about the mysterious nature of the person who drops off the book,” Singleton said. “I have an email address for him and sometimes I’ll contact him and say we’re sold out and we need another 20 copies. And I get no answer back. Then I’ll be walking behind the register one day and there’ll be 20 copies. And one of my co-workers will say, ‘Someone dropped off a bag and said it was for you.’“

Mainstream recognition does not mean you will learn more about him, beyond what he includes in the book. Anonymous authors, even ones who meet with reporters, don’t do book tours. Ruby-Strauss is counting on social media (the author himself has a website, http://www.02thief.com , and Twitter feed, @02thief) and expects that he will give telephone interviews.

“The book has such an underground feel to it, a nontraditional promotional campaign focusing on these elements makes perfect sense,” the editor said.

As his readers would assume and his accent suggests, the author says he is a native of Ireland, who has lived everywhere from London to Minneapolis, but has spent the past decade in New York. Like the narrator of his book, he has spent much of his professional life in advertising. He declines to give his exact age, but says — plausibly — that he’s at least 40.

The author had never attempted a book before “Oxygen Thief,” but wanted to give it a try, unsure if or why anyone would care about a man who begins his tale by confiding, “I liked hurting girls.” The first half reads like a variation of J.P. Donleavy’s “The Ginger Man,” the comic saga of a ne’er-do-well and the affairs ruined by his own design. The gods strike back in the second half as the O2Thief falls for a photographer identified as Aisling and eventually learns — or thinks he learns — she is using him for a book about relationships.

“We can’t be sure this really happened,” the author explained. “It’s like a Hitchcockian story — his view of the world.”

“When I started the book, I understood immediately why it had captured the spirit of the times,” Ruby-Strauss said. “I continued reading, and I discovered it was not the book I thought it was; then I finished reading, only to find my latter revelation was also incorrect. I felt unsettled about the whole thing for several days, which struck me as very promising.”

Self-published best-sellers often debate whether to sign on with a traditional publisher, whether the loss of independence is compensated by the security and resources that enable them to focus solely on writing. The O2Thief is happy to try it both ways. He will continue to be his own boss for his next two volumes: “Chameleon on a Kaleidoscope,” released in 2012 and yet to attain the popularity of “Oxygen Thief,” and the upcoming “Eunuchs and Nymphomaniacs,” inspired by what he calls “an inherent incompatibility between the sexes.”

He’ll consider deals for those books only if “the demand for them also becomes insatiable.”

Punjab’s narco terror: Booming business of pvt rehabs run by ex-addicts,"After every crackdown on the drug menace, windfall at private rehab centres, yet no takers for those run by government",[],2017-05-02 08:52:00+00:00,"“You have to be a drug addict to know the mind of a drug addict.” The words of Amanjeet Singh ring true as private rehab centres run by former addicts have proliferated in Punjab.

A hockey player in his college days, Amanjeet got hooked to smack in the company of friends and had to undergo rehab at Kharar in Mohali. Now, he runs a private rehab centre, Growth Foundation, in Ludhiana. He is also the president of Punjab State Drug Counselling and Rehabilitation Centres’ Union.

HIGH CHARGES AND FACILITIES

The Growth Foundation charges Rs 20,000 for the first month and Rs 15,000 for every subsequent month to wean addicts off drugs. Amanjeet claims the money takes care of food, lodging, sports and gym facilities. For the high charges, he blames the strict guidelines for private centres. “We have to follow the guidelines set by the Punjab and Haryana high court. We have an ambulance, cook, two kitchen helps and a counsellor with masters in social work degree for every 10 patients,” he says. Presently, his 35-bed rehab centre has 25 inmates.

On the outskirts of Rampura Phul, a nondescript town in Bathinda district, a palatial house with yellow flags stands out. Guarded by a German Shepherd and an Anatolian Shepherd, it is from where Adarsh Foundation, an offshoot of an NGO by the same name in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, is running a rehab centre since 2010. The family of its 33-year-old owner Anurag Dwivedi still lives in Varanasi.

Dwivedi himself took to smack in 1997 in Varanasi and went to a rehab centre. “After I came back, I decided to help to other addicts,” he says. He charges Rs 15,000 for first month and Rs 10,000 for subsequent months from families of addicts. “Only those addicts come to the private centres who can afford the treatment,” he says.

COUNSELLING CLASSES

Though he cannot speak in Punjabi, Dwivedi makes do with a former inmate and is now qualified enough to take counselling classes at the basement — its walls full of inspirational quotes on shunning drugs. Among the 25 inmates at his centre, the youngest is a Class-10 student from Bathinda who took to “chitta” (heroin) with friends. “I stayed with the older boys in the school. We went to Mullanpur in Ludhiana to buy heroin. I used to buy mobile phones and sell them at high price to be able to buy 10 grams of heroin for Rs 2,500 a gram. Soon, I became a courier. I had chitta in the morning and Corex syrup in the afternoon. I have given hell to my parents and two sisters. I want to leave drugs and appear for my Class-12 exams,” he said.

Rajat Sood, who runs New Life Rehab and Counselling Society at Phillaur, too had stayed at a rehab for 13 months before his heroin addiction could be cured. His centre with 35 beds presently has 24 inmates. Rajat charges Rs 18,000 for the first month and Rs 10,000 in the subsequent months. “At de-addiction centres, they put addicts on drugs such as Buprenorphine for long periods of time. It also has withdrawal symptoms. So from one addiction, they put them on another. We wean them away through sports and counselling,” he says.

BRISK BUSINESS FOR PVT CENTRES

The business model for the mushrooming private de-addiction and rehab centres is simple. Private psychiatrists running de-addiction centres refer patients to the rehab centres and vice versa. The business gets brisk every time the state government launches an open crackdown on drugs.

But Amanjeet denies private centres are reaping a windfall out of state’s drug problem. “It’s not just a business interest. There is also social interest involved. Drug addicts start losing feelings, sense of spirituality, guilt or introspection. Having been through that journey, we understand their psyche and counsel them through our own life experiences,” he says.

As president of the union, he claims it is not easy to run private rehabs. “We are bombarded by inspection teams of the health department, court and our licences are not renewed for years. As many as 40 licences are pending with the health department. We are also coerced by the police to share contact details of our patients. The day we shut shop, the situation in Punjab will get worse. Government rehabs are run by employees with no personal commitment. Parents do not trust leaving their sons there as drugs can be sneaked in for a tip by the guards,” he says.

TALES OF HORROR

But private rehabs have their own tales of horror. A 28-year-old youth from Gobindpura village in Bathinda admitted at the de-addiction centre of government civil hospital in Bathinda last week said he had lost his job with a company running water treatment plants in villages after he had started injecting two grams of heroin per day. “I went to the Adarsh Foundation’s rehab centre for five months last year. I have developed a disc problem after the frequent beatings,” he said.

Another 27-year-old, also a heroin addict, went to a private rehab at Baghapurana in Moga. “I was there for six months. We were not allowed to meet our parents and we were beaten with belts if we complained of withdrawal symptoms. Once they had tied cloth on our mouths and put loud music on while beating us. But even our families were not too keen to take us back,” he said.

NO PATIENTS AT GOVT CENTRES

Yet the government rehabs do not get patients. The plush 50-bed government rehab centre on the outskirts of Bathinda town wears a haunted look. It has three counsellors, four security guards and just five patients on March 25, when HT team visited the centre. With a gym, LCD, basketball and badminton courts, it charges just Rs 50 a day. “The government de-addiction centre at Bathinda refers patients to us. We cannot force patients to stay against their wishes. Some leave when their parents come to visit, some even try to run away,” said one of the counsellors there.

NOT ALL FORMER ADDICTS HAVE SET UP SHOPS

Some like Gurdeep Singh, who got addicted to smack as early as in Class 7 at Ferozepur, are now working as volunteers for Narcotics Anonymous. The special task force on drugs set up by Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh too wants to rope in Narcotics Anonymous. But Gurdeep Singh says they cannot compromise on the clause of confidentiality. “I too went to a rehab at Muktsar to cure my smack addiction. Addicts want to share their success stories as well as failures only with addicts. The government wants us to hold meetings at every village. We are too small in numbers to do so. But we can help them create awareness through posters and pamphlets. We cannot allow any outsider to be a part of the meetings. Only an addict can understand what he has lost,” he said.

"Taking leftover antibiotics is injurious to health, here’s why",A recent study shows that giving saved antibiotics to others fuels rising rates of antibiotic-resistant infections.,[],2018-11-03 11:09:00+00:00,"We have all been there — taking leftover antibiotics to save a second trip to the doctor. However, a recent study has found that giving saved antibiotics to others — within and outside the family — fuels rising rates of antibiotic-resistant infections. The findings will be presented at the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) National Conference & Exhibition.

Senior author Ruth Milanaik, said the study results show an “alarming” percentage of parents in a national sample report sharing or borrowing antibiotics, a practice called prescription diversion. “This is dangerous not only for those given antibiotics that weren’t prescribed for them, but for entire populations of people who some antibiotics may no longer help when the bacteria they target become resistant to them,” said Dr Milaniak of New York’s Cohen Children’s Medical Center.

For the study, an anonymous online questionnaire was distributed to a national sample of 496 parents though Amazon Mechanical Turk. Nearly half (48.2%) of the parents reported that they had kept leftover antibiotics rather than properly disposing them. Of those, 73% subsequently diverted them to siblings, unrelated children, and unrelated adults — sometimes months after the antibiotic was originally prescribed — all without physician consultation. Parents also used the leftover antibiotics themselves.

Among other findings:

* The most common form of antibiotics diverted was liquids (80.4 percent of parents whose children were prescribed them) and drops (73.8 percent), compared to creams (69.7 percent) and tablets (55.6 percent).

* The dosage of antibiotic that was administered was typically the prescribed dosage, even though the recipient of the antibiotic had changed, or was estimated based on the age of the child.

*Overall, 16 percent of participants stated that they had given their child adult medications.

Dr Milanaik said more effort and resources need to be invested in educating families about how antibiotics work, that they aren’t necessary for all illnesses, and the medical risks of taking antibiotics without consulting a health provider.

“Although the discovery of antibiotics has revolutionised medicine, it is imperative that clinicians emphasise the importance of use and dispose of these medications properly to make sure they remain an effective tool against infectious diseases,” Dr Milanaik said.

Theatre should not be used as a stepping stone for Bollywood: Mahesh Bhatt,"Veteran filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt has an opinion on mostly everything in life, and is never scared to air them either. In the capital recently to attend the premiere of the stage adaptation of his 1989 film Daddy, Bhatt bares his heart on Bollywood, theatre, artists, and much more.",[],2014-08-06 16:23:00+00:00,"Veteran filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt has an opinion on mostly everything in life, and is never scared to air them either.

He was in Delhi recently to attend the premiere of the stage adaptation of his 1989 film Daddy. One of Bollywood's most critically acclaimed films, it mapped the life of an alcoholic trying to kick the habit with help from his daughter. A few months ago, another Bhatt classic, Arth, too was adapted for theatre by Delhi-based artist Imran Zahid.

Speaking about the role, Imran said, ""I read up about people who are fighting addiction and watched the film twice or thrice.""

Speaking to HT, Bhatt said he loved the idea of adapting popular films to a theatre audience. ""Taking a story or experience (of a certain film) to another medium (theatre) only adds to the 'immortality' of the work,"" Bhatt said. He added that it was Imran Zahid's idea to revisit the film with a completely different perspective.



Zahid had also essayed the role of Kulbhsuhan Kharbhanda in the stage adaptation of Arth. He had earlier also acted in Bhatt's production The Last Salue, and hails from Asmita, Delhi-based Arvind Gaur's theatre group.





Imran Zahid in a still from the play Daddy where he essyaed the role of Anand Sarin -- a role that Anupam Kher did in the movie.

When asked if he has any plans to adapt Saaransh or Zakhm similarly, Bhatt said, ""I do not deify my own work. I am not too hung up if someone wants to recreate it. I do not think any irreversible damage will be done if someone recreates it in a way I did not want or I had not thought of. People ask me why do I allow. My answer to them is that I don't care.""

He added, ""I don't think Zakhm can be adapted, because it's a personal narrative and deals with catharsis on a very large canvas. I wonder if there is enough bandwidth in the construct of theatre to capture all of it. The narrative depended a lot on juxtaposing past with future, from the bedroom where the child battles his emotional burden to the streets where the riots happend. I guess it is too large a canvas.""

""Saaransh too was larger-than-life and I doubt there could be stage adaptations. Swayam, a movie I made with Waheeda Rehman, is the story of a woman who is self-sufficient at a ripe old age because she had two daughters who felt obliged to look after their mother after the husband died. It is a dignified story of the life of this woman.That might be the next one.""

Bhatt claims that he was ""not at all involved in the adaptation"". He adds, ""I just came like all of you and saw the work at the premiere. I am not a great theatre critic."".

Talking about the nostalgia of revisiting a classic he made 25 years ago, he said, ""Two anonymous people I ran into an airport told me that Daddy changed their lives. That makes a difference. And theatre is one route through which we could achieve some kind of 'immortality'.""



When asked if theatre artists are getting their due in the film industry, Bhatt said, ""I dont think cinema is the only place where they move to. Theatre should not be used as a stepping stone for Bollywood. Manoj Bajpayee, Om Puri, Naseeruddin Shah and many others have given a lot to the film industry. Om Shiv Puri was the first person to come to cinema from theatre. I think the National School of Drama has given a lot to Indian cinema. TV is also another medium. Sadly, television is seeing an all-time low now.""

Does he plan to mount any film with his protege, Imran Zahid, any time soon?

""You see, there are the heats, the quarter finals, the semis and the finals. Imran has certainly qualified for the heats. Let's see if he makes it to the finals. I cannot lower my strandards for him. I did not do that for my daughter.""

The play will be staged again in the national capital on August 24. It will then travel to Bangalore, Kanpur and other small cities like Jamshedpur, Ranchi and Patna.

Traders in Uttarakhand feel heat as liquor sales miss target,"With the current financial year coming to an end, several liquor shop owners across the state are having a hard time to fill the government coffers",[],2018-03-16 22:18:00+00:00,"With the current financial year coming to an end, several liquor shop owners across the state are having a hard time to fill the government coffers.

A liquor retail shop license holder in Nainital district said he was a tense man these days.

“For small investors like me, liquor is a loss making business. I am not able to sell the stock and the excise department forcing me to collect more quota as pay the fee,” said the trader who prefers to remain anonymous.

The BJP government had set a target of ₹2,310 crore revenue from the liquor business this year. So far, it has collected ₹2,100 crore.

With two weeks remaining before this financial year comes to an end, the target is unlikely to be achieved.

Excise minister Prakash Pant said the year has been a challenging owing to the Supreme Court directives to remove the liquor shops from the national highways.

The order was later relaxed for Uttarakhand and other hill states.

“We are roughly sort of ₹150 crore from the set target. But I am satisfied. The targets were scaled up and it will further stretch to ₹2,500 crore in the coming financial year,” the minister told Hindustan Times.

The government has also principally agreed to introduce the e-auctioning for the allotment of liquor shops. Pant said e-auctioning will ensure fair play in the business.

“Earlier the lottery system for the allotments of shop was adopted. But e-auctioning will altogether a different ball game. The shop will go the highest bidder. It’s a win-win situation for everyone” Pant said.

The government claims that e-auctioning of shops will also break the monopoly of “syndicate”.

However, there is no clarity whether government will also increase the retail price of different brand of liquors in a bid to fill the coffers.

“Increasing retail price will not help as a large number of cheap liquor is already being smuggled from Haryana into state. On the other hand, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand at present has similar price rates,” said a senior sales executive of a major liquor brand.

The minister agreed smuggling is pinching the industry and coffers. He, however, denied that anti-liquor movements erupted earlier were “genuine”.

According to industry insiders, people consume anything between 52 to 55 lakh cases of liquor every year in the hill state. A case comprises 12 bottles.

Jolie and Pitt abruptly announced their separation at the end of 2016. The split was followed by intense media speculation - rumours of child abuse and negligence were floated and there was an acrimonious custody battle over the couple’s six children.

According to the source, things are still not quite sorted between the two and they ‘can barely sit in the same room together’ even though they’ve attended joint therapy sessions with the kids.

"Wanted to write about routine, habit and ruptures in both: Anjali Joseph","Anjali Joseph, author of The Living, speaks about getting to know her own characters, connecting with readers, and the controversy about Amit Chaudhuri’s review of her novel.",['Saaz Aggarwal'],2016-04-09 14:06:00+00:00,"Some years ago, I read Saraswati Park, Anjali Joseph’s debut novel, aloud to a friend, once a librarian but no longer able to read. We both admired its literary skill, and did not feel it needed more action. This is relevant because critical reviews at the time complained that nothing exciting happened in the book and it, therefore, was not a good one. We wondered what these people would have said about Jane Austen if they were reading her for the first time, and congratulated ourselves smugly when Saraswati Park went on to win the Betty Trask Prize, the Desmond Eliot Prize, and in time, the Vodafone Crossword Prize too.

With The Living, Anjali Joseph has surpassed her skill of saying so very much with so very few words. During the course of this interview, I also realised, with growing horror, that I’m the long-suffering mother of the person with whom Ms Joseph was accosting young men outside a bakery to find out more about haathbhatti. A coincidence, I promise, but in the interest of full disclosure and all.

Why footwear, why these particular cities?

For me, the impetus to write a novel comes in two forms. The primary one is an image; the secondary is an idea or a question. For Saraswati Park I had an image of a man at a secondhand book stall in Flora Fountain in Mumbai, looking for books with marginal notations just before evening rush hour. And I knew I wanted to write about the daydreaming, book-reading, middle-class Bombay where I’d spent my early years and where my parents and grandparents had lived. For this book, I had the image of a man making a pair of chappals. I’ve been wearing Kolhapuris since I was a child. The first pair I had was brought for me by my grandfather from a work trip to Kolhapur when I was three or four. I still wear Kolhapuris all the time, and find them both beautiful and practical, and I knew I wanted to write about the idea of daily work, of craft, and of some of the parts of life with which fiction deals less frequently: routine, habit, and ruptures in both. I also had an image of a woman in Norwich, originally in a place called Lion Wood, which appears in the novel. I realized she worked in a shoe factory, a profession that’s now anachronistic but which used to be one of the main trades in Norwich, where I was living when I started writing this novel.

Love is Always Right and Other Musings review: A handy map that makes navigating through life easy

Author Anjali Joseph’s new novel The Living.

Could you describe the reader you were writing for?

I don’t really know, but I did want to write a book that plausibly might carry the voices of these two people – the kind of working class people who don’t consider themselves especially interesting and wouldn’t see their lives as the stuff of fiction. I am more interested in those lives than in the apparently exceptional or heroic, and I suppose my larger project is to illuminate the beauty of all of our lives, even (especially?) in their humdrum moments: everyday magic.

Read: Kanishk Tharoor | Of storytellers and storytelling

Then you’re not writing for a particular reader as some writers say they do?

I don’t think about anything other than the writing while I am writing. The reader-writer connection does matter to me – as a reader to begin with, and also as a writer. It’s a small miraculous thing, the possibility of connecting with someone you may never meet. It’s a real connection.

I enjoyed your poetic translation of Akashvani. Any examples I may have missed because I didn’t have the context?

I did use a few bits of Norwich speech, though Claire, the first narrator doesn’t talk in full Norfolk dialect, since she’s grown up in the city. ‘There was weather’, for example, means ‘The weather was bad’. I was also inspired by some of the things I’d seen when growing up in England in the mid and late 1980s: canned Alphabetti Spaghetti, for example, or corner shops. Those things are part of the furniture of the novel.

Did you find your characters changing as you wrote, or did they stay true to your early conception of them?

Arun was initially more sarcastic, less tender, less nagging; Claire’s relationship with her son is something that became much warmer than I’d initially predicated. The process of writing a novel involves getting to know characters: their facades and what’s inside.

Any interesting stories about the research you did to get all this together?

I spent a week in a shoe factory in Norwich, in January a few years ago. The people who worked there were generous with their time and attention and let me watch them work, and chat to them as they did; I found out the things I would rather not make up, like what it feels like when the bells go for breaks, or how the light falls at different times of day; how the shop floor, as it’s called, smells when the roughing machines come on in the morning. I also visited Kolhapur and nearby Miraj twice. Once I met chappal makers, thanks to the kindness of Vinayak Kadam of Adarsh Charmodyog Centre in Kolhapur. Most of the chappal makers work at home so I went around their houses with him and watched them work a little, and talked to them. The second time I visited, I wanted particularly to do two things. One was visit a country liquor bar in the area where the chappal makers live and work, because I knew Arun, the second narrator, had been an alcoholic for many years.

The other was to find a small temple in a field that I’d dreamt of his visiting as a child. It was good that I went to Kolhapur because I realized that unlike Bombay it doesn’t have that many country liquor bars; government authorized country liquor is sold by certain people in certain areas, and then illegal, much cheaper and stronger haathbhatti is sold as home brew. A kind young man, a non-drinker himself, helped me find some haathbhatti when I accosted him outside a bakery one evening and asked where the country liquor bars were. He was worried my friend and I would get into trouble so he chivalrously escorted us to buy haathbhatti, then pleaded with me not to make a regular habit of drinking it. And the next day, while we were aimlessly driving around in the morning, we found the temple in the fields, basically as a gift.

I was going to say, ‘Hmm why so much sexual activity!’ but also wanted to note my appreciation of your female interpretations of the sexual act.

Sex is a big part of life, isn’t it? For Claire I think it represents a new opening out of her life after a long period of essentially mourning the teenage relationship that resulted in and ended with the birth of her son. For Arun I think it represents one of the few unregimented parts of his life. Everything else – work, marriage, eating, sleeping – is somehow inevitable. He loves his wife; he loves his family. But the randomness of unplanned extramarital sex creates a rupture in that, and brings both a sense of freedom and sadness and guilt. I’m not sure what to say about a female experience of sex in general. I think for Claire there’s an experimental quality to the relationships she has. In her youth love was simple, but it ended. In her thirties, it’s not so simple for a while, but she also has a few transgressive encounters with a much younger man, her son’s friend, and there are no repercussions from that. That idea, which somehow seems normal for a male character, is something I found interesting. Part of the matter-of-factness of these characters and the lives they lead, in which time is parceled out in units that they make, is expressed in this experience that at times sex is just sex. At other times, of course, it brings emotions: wonder, surprise, grief.

Sexual acts in the public domain invariably describe men as experiencing mindless enjoyment whereas Claire does seem capable of thought during the process, could that be a feminine statement?

I don’t know. Now that you say it I seem to remember Molly Bloom doesn’t stop chatting to herself during sex either. Perhaps it is a type of mind, not a gender-based difference?

Amit Chaudhuri gave The Living a rave review in The Guardian and a disgruntled reader wrote in to say that, as your former teacher and mentor, he must be biased.

I was glad and grateful to read the review – it was written by one of my favourite writers. I hadn’t asked for it to be written, or tried to influence what it said. Huffington Post wrote about the incident and asked for my response, but I didn’t see why I should engage with accusations levied in anonymous emails. In any case, it’s for a reader to flip through the book and decide if it seems to speak to him, or her.

"Denied rights and treatment, HIV patients still fight stigma",Discrimination is rife at both government and private hospitals but it gets difficult to fix the responsibility as patients stay away from filing complaints.,"['Shruti Tomar', 'Rhythma Kaul']",2017-10-30 07:37:00+00:00,"On October 5, a 27-year-old HIV positive woman hanged herself from a pipe in Hyderabad’s Osmania General Hospital after being denied admission, which is given free under India’s National AIDS Control Programme (NACO).

In another incident last month, doctors declared a 24-year-old pregnant woman admitted to Tikamgarh district hospital in Madhya Pradesh a ‘human bomb’ after she tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

The confidential pathology report was leaked by the lab technician, and within hours, everybody from the doctor to the nurse and the ward boy refused to treat her. She finally delivered twins, who died within 30 minutes of birth, unattended on the ward floor.

Following media reports, a staff nurse and the lab technician were suspended and a show-cause notice was issued to the civil surgeon.

“It’s really unfortunate that doctors and supporting staff shy away from their duties. We will ensure that incidents like Tikamgarh are not repeated. Hospitals are provided enough resources for treatment, such as protection gear,” said Pallavi Jain Govil, health mission commissioner, Madhya Pradesh.

But providing protective gear is clearly not enough. “We have a (monitoring) committee in every district headed by the district collector but I haven’t noticed a proactive behaviour by anybody, including hospital administration, on how to train staff to treat people living with HIV,” said Madhya Pradesh AIDS control society joint director Savita Thakur.

Deja vu

Free counselling, testing and treatment has helped India lower new infections to 80,000 a year, which have stabilised HIV numbers at 2.1 million, shows UNAIDS Report 2016, yet ignorance around this once feared infection persists.

Epidemic fact sheet New infections from HIV have almost halved in India over the past decade, but decline has to be greater to end AIDS by 2030 New infections from HIV have almost halved in India over the past decade, but decline has to be greater to end AIDS by 2030

Over the past three years, at least a dozen people living with HIV have been denied treatment at government hospitals in Madhya Pradesh, and hundreds more across the country.

In Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly district last year, an HIV positive woman delivered a stillborn after a hospital in neighbouring Badaun refused to treat her because she didn’t have Rs 2,000 to buy gloves for the hospital staff.

Discrimination in both government and private health centres and hospitals is rife across states, say people living with HIV and AIDS (PLHA). “Paramedics and nursing staff and in some cases even doctors often refuse to take care of HIV+ patients,” said Swapan Mallick (name changed), who has HIV and works with Bengal Network of PLHAs.

Sensitisation affects quality, which varies widely across government hospitals in the same city, with those with NACO’s voluntary counselling and testing centres (VCTC) usually better equipped to treat PLHAs.

“For example, even within Kolkata, patients feel at ease in N R S Medical College and Hospital that has a VCTC centre, but face stigma from a section of nursing staffs and paramedical staff in other teaching hospitals like R G Kar Medical College and National Medical College,” said Kallol Ghosh, founder-director of OFFER, an NGO that works with children with HIV.

Legal situation

In April this year, the Parliament passed the HIV and AIDS (Prevention and Control) Bill, 2017, that guarantees equal rights in medical treatment, admission to educational institutions and jobs to people living with HIV/AIDS, but the Act is yet to be notified.

If an HIV positive patient is refused treatment at a government health facility, then the patient can move court, but the same doesn’t hold true for private hospitals till the Act is notified.

“Under Aarticle 14 of the Constitution people have right to equality and health, and the person can move court if treatment is refused in a government hospital,” said Raman Chawla, lawyer and HIV-activist.

“Nothing much can be done if a private hospital refuses treatment, till the HIV law comes into force. Once the law is implemented, it will also cover private health facilities,” said Chawla.

“Rules and regulations are to be drafted before it gets notified. The process is on,” said a senior Union health ministry official, who did not want to be named.

Filing complaints is a must. In the case of the Telangana woman hanging herself, for example, the sister told the media that the woman was denied hospital admission but did not file a police complaint. Police registered a case under Section 174 of the CrPC (suspicious death).

The hospital has denied the charge. “There is no question of denying treatment to the patient, even if a person is in advanced stage of HIV infection. The investigation will reveal the truth,” said Osmania General Hospital superintendent Dr GVS Murthy.

But errant doctors seem to be a step ahead. An officer in MP State AIDS Control Society who looks into complaints against doctors and para-medical staff said on the condition of anonymity, “I have seen that doctors prepare their reports so smartly that it’s difficult to fix responsibility on them.”

Along with the law, what are needed are sensitisation workshops for medical staff. “Instead of mass media campaigns, what is needed is intensive sensitisation campaign among health professionals in government hospitals,’ said Mallik.

Prince Harry treated Vegas party-goers to his crown jewels,"Prince Harry, who recently made headlines for his bare-assed antics at a Las Vegas hotel, was happy to leave his crown jewels on display as he frolicked with babes in his V.I.P. suite, it has been revealed.",[],2012-08-31 19:04:00+00:00,"Prince Harry, who recently made headlines for his bare-assed antics at a Las Vegas hotel, was happy to leave his crown jewels on display as he frolicked with babes in his V.I.P. suite, it has been revealed.

According to new reports from the US, the 27-year-old boozy royal paraded around starkers for a “long time” at his X-rated Las Vegas bash.

An anonymous source said Harry “didn’t seem to care what he did” at the strip billiards party that went on to make headlines around the world.

Nude Prince Harry

The Royal Family was left reeling when his nude snaps were leaked online amid claims that fellow revellers were snorting cocaine.

Now pool party babe Melissa Vagner has broken her silence to claim that the prince was already on the rampage two nights before the scandalous snaps were taken.

The 32-year-old met Prince Harry at the Encore Beach Club on August 18.

“Harry had two things in his sights, Grey Goose vodka and women,” the Daily Star quoted her as saying.

“His eyes were like little radars pinpointing girls around the pool and then trying to talk with them, or get them in his cabana.

“He couldn’t stop himself. He stopped by a group of girls on pool side where we were stood up and looked over at us and smiled,” she said.

Melissa said he yelled “I am going away so this is my last chance to party. So that is what I am doing”.

“He did not mention he was in the Army or was going to war. You could tell he was on his way to getting obliterated,” she added.

"Temple of charity: A roof over the head, balm for their souls, patients get it all in PGI gurdwara","Bedridden for over a year at the on the campus of Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Sangeeta Sharma, 32, beams a peaceful smile. The semi-paralysed single mother, who is suffering from kidney ailments and a fractured hip bone, is used to living with illness without any family support, but it’s the thought of her three children that had been driving her insane.

The semi-paralysed single mother, who is suffering from kidney ailments and a fractured hip bone, is used to living with illness without any family support, but it’s the thought of her three children that had been driving her insane. Today she is at peace as the gurdwara has agreed to take the custody of her children.

Established in 1980s, the gurdwara is the last hope for many patients like Sangeeta, who come to the PGI for treatment from far-flung areas, and find themselves stranded with little or no resources.

It was a year ago that Sangeeta, a resident of Rishikesh, who had suffered partial paralysis following a brain stroke, came to the PGI for treatment. She did not expect any support from her abusive and alcoholic husband, but to her dismay, her family also slammed their doors on her.

It was then that the gurdwara opened its gates for her and her three children.

“They spend around Rs 15,000 per month on my medicines and take me for tests. They have taken the responsibility of my children as well and are funding their education,” says Sangeeta, who has decided to give their custody to the gurdwara instead of their father. “I can finally die in peace, “she sighs.

Simran, her 10-year-old daughter, is besides herself with excitement as tells you how she will be shifted to a new hostel with her sister. “They will give me new books and bags. It will be fun,” she beams.

Like Simran, Anchal Dhiman, 15, too has been given a reason to smile by the gurdwara. The last two years have been a nightmare for this teenager. “My mother is undergoing spine treatment at PGIMER since 2014. Instead of taking care of her, my father left us. Because of stress, my hemoglobin fell to 3 and I was also shifted to PGI,” she recounts. Anchal had to leave her studies and take care of her mother. “We used to spend the nights at Gol market on the campus. It was a horrifying experience,” she recalls.

But the gurdwara changed all that. “The bad days seem to be over. We have a roof over our heads, and they’ve also got me admitted to a school. My life is back to normal,” Anchal smiles.

They are not the only ones benefiting from the gurdwara’s generosity. The education of several other children of poor patients is being supported by a businessman, Inderpreet Singh Chadha, fondly called baba.

Chadha funds medications worth Rs 10 lakh for around 500 patients every month. They include 90 kidney patients and 250 cancer patients. Chadha has also started a monthly pension of Rs 1200 for 35 renal transplant patients. Around 40 women whose husbands died in PGIMER also get a pension of Rs 1,000 a month.

The businessman first visited the gurdwara with his friend who was undergoing treatment for liver cancer. “I noticed an elderly woman crying and urging her son to leave. She told me that as she could not afford the treatment, she would prefer to die in the gurdwara,” recalls Chadha. “I could not stomach the fact that people were dying for want of medicine. So I decided to provide medicines to the needy from my family Trust,” he said.

Chadha decided to focus on educating the children of patients when he saw them wandering aimlessly. Shikha, a wheelchair-bound teenager suffering from cancer, joined hands with him by starting evening classes for them. “While she would teach them, I would get them to stay on by giving them biscuits,” says Chadha.

Shikha is no more, but the example she set inspired him to get such children admitted to government schools in Sector 15 and 12. At present, more than 70 children are studying in these schools. A few children are also taking professional education from PU and other universities. The evening classes started by Shikha continue, thanks to two teachers hired by Chadha, who is now building dorms for girl students.

There are many other philanthropists like Chadha who are associated with the gurdwara. For instance, Hakim Singh supplies it with milk and vegetables. Owners of Sigma Pharmacy organise a biweekly langar. And owners of Park Plaza donate 36 litres of milk every day.

Gurdwara Partakh Darshan has been coming to the rescue of patients and attendants from far-flung regions for more than two decades now. Large number of these patients are suffering from chronic diseases like cancer and kidney failure, which makes treatment a very expensive affair.

Nearly 2,000 people take shelter at the two serais of the gurdwara and over 4,000 people are served langar every day.

“The gurdwara is running on donations by the people. There are many donors, who are associated with it for years, and then there are anonymous good Samaritans,” says Tarsem Singh, a sewak at the gurdwara.

"Family is a cartel, its objective is to overcome the state","A family is a cartel, it has always been so. Its objective is to overcome the State and provide an unfair advantage to its young.",[],2015-07-12 22:50:00+00:00,"As we know, a spouse is the person who would be the chief suspect in the mysterious death of the other spouse (unless the deceased was linked to Vyapam). The writer Elif Batuman, in a review of ‘Gone Girl’, described marriage as “an abduction”. Over a decade ago, the cartoonist Michael Shaw raised the question in a cartoon, ‘Gays and lesbians getting married — haven’t they suffered enough?’

The defamation of marriage is often wise, but no amount of artistic brilliance can so effectively insult what marriage leads to and holds — the core family. When it works, there is no team like a family. In circumstances that endanger its survival a family can even be deadly.

The hit Tamil film of the season, ‘Papanasam’, which is a remake of a Malayalam film, is about a regular family lolling in simple joys until one day when they are faced with an extraordinary situation from which they have to extricate themselves. The two leads Kamal Haasan and Gauthami are in the real world lovers who have expressed contempt for the idea of marriage. In the film, he is a cable-operator and she his content wife, and they are a small town sexually active middle-aged couple. They have two daughters, one a child and the other a young woman. Circumstances force the young woman to commit a crime, and the family has to work together to destroy the evidence.

For commercial reasons, the victim of the crime is despicable. Even if he were not, many of us would be on the side of the cable-operator’s family as it breaks several laws to save itself. Also, this would be the only time most of us would love a cable-operator.

Families usually do not require one of its own to commit a crime to become a team. In many small ways, every day, they are just that. And like wild animals, they thrive in captivity. Most people find happiness, even appreciation, only in a family or a portion of a family. In the world outside they are nothing, they are treated as nothing. And they treat the world that surrounds their home merely as a place where they forage for food. In fact, most people derive the conviction that they are virtuous purely from how they are at home, how they love their own. The Dursleys, for instance, are a good family, if they are not seen from Harry Potter’s point of view. Much love in that house when Potter is at school.

Families were always vital to individuals but in the recent times, across the world, there appears to be a reverent acceptance of the fact. It is increasingly hard for the wild to remain wild and keep a family too. The reason why a particular beast of the middle class who survived well until the last generation is increasingly endangered — the delinquent alcoholic head of the family. The circumstances of women have changed and they can now kick such men out, however fascinating they might be as characters. Also, an underrated force in male reformation is the fact that old men recede and the new men do not wish to be their fathers.

A family is a cartel, it has always been so. What are known as traditional family values are compensations for the failures of the government. The objective of a family then is to overcome the State and provide an unfair advantage to its young. This was, until recently, done by a network of relations often living in the same house. And the young appeared to respect the old because the old were useful. The same reason why a poor man’s son is more likely to rebel against his father than a rich man’s son. As the society prospered the family discarded its peripheral relations because they were not required, but the smallest efficient unit is still the nuclear family and not the individual.

The Indian society is not a contest between individuals but between families. Increasingly, even in the United States and Britain, this is the case because unfair advantages, even in those nations, have become extremely lucrative. The income gap between lowbrow jobs and jobs that require higher education and social contacts has become vast even in the developed world.

But what about the charms of a solitary life, a life saved from the “abduction” of marriage and all that follows? Only a fraction of those who fantasise about such a life are equipped to live this way. The rumoured beauty of a life outside family is to an extent a result of the disproportionate influence that artists, who may love solitude as much as they claim, have had over popular anthropology.

Also, the frequency of the lone protagonist in stories is caused by a flaw in the first draft — in the first sketch of characterisation the central character is most often solitary because the other characters with whom he or she would interact are yet to be formed. The interaction between characters is a difficult part of story formation and often the flawed solitude of the protagonist survives the future drafts. And there is the matter of sheer convenience. When a story is not about a family, it would greatly help the plotting to make the protagonist a loner.

All through this, in the real world for whom these stories are written, most people crave to be in families. That way they would not be anonymous, and they would have a witness to their days. And they would be in the care of a deadly team.

Is art the new meditation?,"The arts class has moved to a bar near you.

It’s 4pm on a muggy Saturday afternoon in Bandra-Kurla Complex. The PizzaExpress outlet bears a desolate look, except for the Paint Party group at the far end of the restaurant. The plates, napkins and cutlery have been put away, and replaced with canvases. The tables are covered in plastic sheets.

Fifteen apron-clad participants are busy painting their version of A Walk in the Rain (a couple kissing in the rain against a vibrant backdrop), an acrylic artwork made using a knife and paint brushes by an anonymous artist. It’s a familiar-enough work, which gets reproduced on everything from cushions to wall paintings.

The instructor, a commerce student and a self-taught artist, is doing the rounds, checking each person’s canvas and giving tips. In between brush strokes, the participants sip on lime juice and take bites of pizza — the perks of being in an eatery. They also click photos of their works at various stages. At the end of the session, a group photo is taken of the participants with their works — the photos are uploaded on social media to give the participants bragging rights.

For Oindrilla Purohit (42), a communications faculty member at Whistling Woods International, this was the first time she picked up a paintbrush since she was a kid. “It is a good way to unwind and connect with yourself,” she says. Nigel Ebenezer Griffiths (32), a real estate sales professional, tells us it’s his birthday tomorrow. “I gifted myself this session. This is my first painting ever,” he says proudly, showing us his work.

This three-hour-long session is a far cry from the art class in school, one where you were scolded for not drawing a straight line or colouring outside the lines. And it also makes art — always perceived as a lonely, solitary pursuit — a tool to bond with people.

Mumbaikars can’t seem to get enough of such sessions. Apart from Paint Party (which organises two to four such events every month), there are groups like Paintstorm and Paint the Town (which hosts monthly sessions) and Bombay Drawing Room (three to four sessions a month).Venues like Artisans’ in Colaba and experiential groups like Seek Sherpa and BlueBulb also offer art sessions for beginners.

Such art meet-ups are being held at prominent eateries across the city such as Café Zoe, Chaayos, Jamjar Diner and Social. They see an average turnout of 20 to 30 people per session, a feat that few art galleries can pull off on a regular basis.

The themes are familiar — pop culture icons like Darth Vader (from Star Wars) or music bands like The Beatles, reproductions of The Starry Night (Vincent Van Gogh’s masterpiece) or even the scenery of a haiku.

The painting clubs

One of the frontrunners of the paint-and-dine concept in Mumbai was Paintstorm. Started in July last year, its founders are graphic designer Prerna Chhabria and marketer Viren Chhabria, along with fashion designers Aanchal Bubber Mehta and Sanjana Bubber. “The options for creative recreation are virtually non-existent in Mumbai. These events are great for family bonding, reunions, dates, or for those new to the city,” says Prerna.

Divya Chadha (34), a wedding planner, who attended a Paintstorm session, recalls how the session took her back to kindergarten. She also made a friend during one of the sessions and now, they attend events together. “We give a unique spin to each of the subjects we draw. For Darth Vader (the session held on Sunday), we made floral headpieces,” she laughs.

Paintstorm was followed by The Bombay Drawing Room (October 2015) and Paint Party (November 2015). Snehal Patil (28), founder of Bombay Drawing Room, an architect and a self-taught artist, says she wanted to create a space where participants could “shed the anxiety of making mistakes”. Paint Party, run by software engineer Pinky Panjwani and ex-advertising professional Mala Sharma, is modelled on the paint-and-dine sessions held globally.

While Paint Party charges between Rs 2,000 and Rs 2,500 per person (inclusive of materials, food and non-alcoholic beverages), Paintstorm and Bombay Drawing Room charge upward of Rs 1,500 (exclusive of food and beverages). “Our sessions are held during the slow hours at eateries. People pay for food and beverages, which is good for the restaurant, and we get space in return,” says Sharma.

Claim to fame

While art and art galleries are often projected as catering to a select audience, informal sessions such as these are for everyone. Most groups are clear that the primary purpose is to unwind, and there is no judgment or criticism imparted to the participants. “The idea is to spark creativity and entertain. So we don’t get technical,” says Sharma.

But in the absence of feedback and critical evaluation, are you actually making art? Curator Jasmine Shah Varma feels that such sessions may be the first step in developing a deeper interest in art: “The quality might vary in each session and there is no set curriculum, so it’s hard to assess. But it can be a stepping stone for amateurs who may eventually read books on art, attend exhibitions, and speak to curators. I am all for it if it makes art accessible and fosters curiosity.”

These painting sessions are also in keeping with global trends. Over the last few years, the concept of mixing food, drinks, painting and socialising has become a bit of a micro-phenomenon internationally. Boston and New York have dedicated paint bars (step-by-step painting lessons meets Guinness on tap). Los Angeles has the Paint and Sip Studio. London has its share of art pop-up painting workshops where people with no prior experience come together to recreate an artwork.

Art that heals

The big draw, though, isn’t just the opportunity to paint without the pressure of producing something impressive. These sessions stem from the idea of art as a form of escape or therapy, even a psychological return to childhood. And that has led to a slew of workshops on mindfulness in art.

In May, Kunjal Shah, an art therapist from Inner Space Counseling, hosted a session at Artisans’. Termed as A No Eraser Art Therapy workshop, it encouraged people to face up to their reality while creating intuitive art. “Art helps people who are unaware of inner conflicts explore them without revisiting painful details,” says Shah. At times, she admits, art can work better than a psychotherapy session in dealing with issues.

“Art therapy is helpful for people who have been through traumatic experiences. Trauma is stored in isolated portions of the brain in the form of images. Art therapy helps access those images and start the process of healing,” says psychotherapist H’vovi Bhagwagar. Painting also stimulates the release of endorphins (pain-relieving neurotransmitters) and dopamine (stimulates the brain’s learning process). “These chemicals boost your mood and alleviate depression, anxiety and other negative emotions,” explains Bhagwagar. Perhaps that explains the high participants talk about following a session.

Fill in the blanks

Coinciding with the rise of painting clubs, there has been a parallel interest in colouring books for grown-ups. A more intricate and elaborate counterpart to the colouring books of your childhood, these have become a craze globally (Nielsen Bookscan estimates that 12 million books were sold in 2015 in the US, a sizeable jump from 1 million sold in 2014).

While Secret Garden: An Inky Treasure Hunt and Colouring Book set off the trend globally, India now has local variants. Artist Sujaya Batra released an illustrated version of Khalil Gibran’s The Prophet this year, while Good Earth and Penguin India teamed up to release Baagh-e-Bahar, a Mughal-inspired colouring book for adults.

Nimish Shah (31), fashion designer, who runs the label Shift, is a fan of the Baagh-e-bahar book. “I have two left hands. For me, this book was an impulse buy. It was brought as a mocking exercise, thinking ‘I will never do something like this’. Once I got started, I was hooked. It’s always there on my coffee table now. When I am babysitting or just bored, this is what I turn to.”

At a time when people’s attention spans are at an all-time low and socialising conjures visions of people huddled together browsing their phones, art might just be the game changer.
