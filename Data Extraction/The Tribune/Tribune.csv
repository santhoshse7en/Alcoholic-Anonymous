"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,[],2000-08-08 00:00:00,"HEALTH Alcoholism is a disease like cancer or diabetes

Tribune News Service CHANDIGARH, Aug 7  The representative of the Disha group of Alcoholics Anonymous, who came with an invitation for their first anniversary meeting, which was held here yesterday, was quite specific. No photographs, no surnames. We just want to spread some awareness in the public about alcoholism. The common man has to know that alcoholism is a disease like cancer or diabetes or any other. And is very much curable . However, the disease is much misunderstood, thanks to the harsh judgements passed by society. Hence the stress on anonymity. Therefore Press is welcome at any A.A. open meetings or similar gathering of recovered alcoholics. The only restriction is a request not to disclose the name or take photographs of any A.A. member. Yesterday's meeting, in Indira Holiday Home was a revelation, at least for a non-alcoholic. First and foremost, it is important to understand that alcoholism is a disease. As Sidhu, once alcoholic and now sober army man, while speaking about his experiences said,"" The only difference is that, unlike any other disease, the entire family gets affected by it. Therefore the result is totally devastating."" Incidentally, this army man is also a former national sports champion. An alcoholic is like a tornado, who rolls through the lives of others. That is why, Al Anon, the fellowship of the families of alcoholics is equally important. As it is through sharing of personal experiences, members gain insight into dealing with their own situation. Nimmi, a member of the Al Anon revealed,"" I learnt after attending Al Anon meetings that I am not responsible for my husband being an alcoholic. All this while, I was crucifying myself that my husband was drinking because I was not beautiful or may be good enough for him. This immature attitude resulted in my social and family life. It was after I joined the Al Anon that my focus shifted on myself."" This is what the Al Anon group does, through sharing a common bond and a realisation that their lives have been affected by another person's drinking, the families of the alcoholics learn to share experience, hope and strength. Mahi, a daughter of an alcoholic, too learned through the programme to stop comparing her father with those of her friends. "" I stopped hating my father for one. I was asked, by someone in the programme, that if your father was suffering from cancer would you still treat him badly? This changed the entire perspective. Through sharing, I learnt that my father was a sick man and I have to stop punishing him."" All this while, when the families are gaining confidence through self help, the alcoholic following some simple steps is on his way to recovery and sobriety. In his endeavour, his fellow alcoholics help him and so do some professionals. Dr A.K. Malhotra, Head of the De-addiction Center, PGI, while presenting the clinical aspect of the disease said that a sober cannot understand the problems of an alcoholic. "" Medical treatment amounts to only 10 per cent in the road to the recovery. Here lies the importance of the A.A. fellowship. The alcoholic learns to speak out and also evaluate what he has said. After all they and only they know what the illness feels like."" Actually the pledge of an alcoholic sums it all up :"" I am responsible, when anyone, anywhere reaches out for help. I want the hand of A.A. always to be there. And for that, I am responsible.""

When she hits the bottle...,"TheTribune: Today, globally India shows the third largest increase in alcohol consumption in the last 20 years, up by 52 per cent. In 2012-13, the India Centre for Alcohol Studies (INCAS), a government research body, had predicted that alcohol consumption among women in the country would grow by 25 per cent in the next five years, higher by 15 per cent than the overall rise projected for the industry.",['Tribune News Service'],2016-07-31 00:58:00,"Families may be ready to go all out to help an alcoholic son but often find it tough to admit that the daughter has a problem

Linda Chhakchhuak

Today, globally India shows the third largest increase in alcohol consumption in the last 20 years, up by 52 per cent. In 2012-13, the India Centre for Alcohol Studies (INCAS), a government research body, had predicted that alcohol consumption among women in the country would grow by 25 per cent in the next five years, higher by 15 per cent than the overall rise projected for the industry.

Among the key reasons for this exponential rise in alcohol consumption, particularly among urban upwardly-mobile women, is the misplaced notion that they are ‘cool’ and ‘liberated’ if they raise a glass. Whereas having the freedom to choose and breaking gender stereotypes are vital for women's agency, this need not necessarily extend to asserting the ‘right to consume alcohol’. Of course, predictably, liquor manufacturers have latched on to this popular perception of 'liberated womanhood' and they are not just launching but also aggressively marketing new variants of alcoholic drinks targeted specifically at women. Indeed, leading brands are not hesitant to concede that their markets have expanded, thanks largely to this growing trend.

Unfortunately, the ‘good times’ only lead to not-so-good-times for many who start off as recreational drinkers but soon become habitual. As is the case with addicts around the world, according to Alcoholic Anonymous India (AA-I), women here, too, find it difficult to say, “I am an alcoholic”, words, they believe, are the first step towards dealing with this addiction. In the north-eastern states, while it's easy for women to buy a drink, it's difficult for them to find a de-addiction facility that caters to their needs. In fact, gender bias rears its ugly head even here, as families are ready to go all out to help a son but are only too eager to ignore, deny or hide a daughter's problem.

Recently, in a first for the Northeast region, the AA-I set up the Shillong Women's Fellowship, a platform for women who want to give up their addiction. At the launch of this critical service, Father Joseph H. Pereira, founder of Kripa Foundation, which offers rehabilitation to those affected by chemical dependency and HIV/AIDS, emphasised that “alcoholism is a disease and not a sin to be condemned”. He observed, “There are so many people who are afflicted with this disease and many have succumbed to it. Yet, the shame and negative stereotype associated with this condition doesn't allow people to come forward and deal with their addiction.”

For women battling chemical dependency, a term often used interchangeably with substance abuse, even admitting to addition is difficult, let alone confronting it. Sister Rose Paite, a member of the General Service Board (GSB) of the AA-I, who has worked on the issue of sobriety for women for the last 13-odd years, explained that the situation in the north-east states is dire because women, and the society at large, is in a state of denial.

Calling alcoholism a “hidden epidemic”, she fervently wished their efforts would soon question this dangerous status quo. Sister Paite is the convenor of the movement for helping Women in Recovery for Sobriety that hopes to encourage the creation of similar AA-I fellowships for women across the region.

Both Father Pereira and Sister Paite strongly recommended the need for a “holistic method” like the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) method, which is based on a 12-step programme, as there was no “chemical solution for chemical dependency”. “The medical model has totally failed. There is nothing more powerful than the AA method,” they asserted, adding that if one has gained sobriety, they must not keep it to themselves but share the experience with others.

As it is, the odds are stacked against women, be it socially or medically. Said Sister Paite, “Parents would like to spend much on sons, but when it comes to daughters, they say they do not have money.” Explaining the medical dimension, Dr Harsh Udawat, Chairman of the GSB of the AA-I, iterated that alcohol consumption was more risky for women than for men. “Alcoholism is a progressive disease and there is no real cure for it. As a doctor, I have seen innumerable cases and can definitely validate the fact that there is nothing really very good about alcohol. Naturally, it does come down to one's personal choice and there cannot be any denying that, but exercising caution is crucial when it comes to drinking. In any case, the death rate among alcohol dependent women is 50 per cent, which is 100 per cent higher than in men,” said the doctor, who is also a gastroenterologist in Jaipur, Rajasthan.

Besides the experts, there were quite a few women from Mizoram and Delhi, who came forward to talk about their experiences and share their ideas on motivating those battling alcoholism to seek support. Stating that the programmes under AA “had come to their rescue”, they wanted many more to understand the value of the sisterhood they shared being part of an AA group. “As an alcoholic, I felt that I was on the verge of dying,” related one, while another spoke of how she had “decided to put my best foot forward to help others”.

The woman, who led the group from Delhi, explained that there were 30 women associated with them, “all sober and recovering”, ready to talk about their experiences with their “sisters”. For women from Mizoram and Meghalaya present at the meeting, it was “cathartic” to come face-to-face with those who had benefited from the AA approach and hear them speak openly about addiction on a public platform.

“Clearly, without sustained medical and psychological intervention to deal with their problem, women alcoholics are setting themselves for a downfall,” cautioned Sister Paite. This disturbing reality motivated her to initiate the Shillong Women's Fellowship so that it's easier for women to come forward and seek a helping hand. “I want the women from the Northeast to fearlessly work on their sobriety issues,” she urged. Under the Shillong Women's Fellowship, recovery meetings are slated to be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays at the Don Bosco Youth Centre in the city. While there is no fee for AA membership, an absolute must is the yearning to change.

Women are natural fighters — they can speak up against discrimination, they can stand up to problems. If they are leading movements to bring about and enforce prohibition in several states, overcoming alcoholism cannot be insurmountable for them. — WFS","['sister', 'bottle', 'paite', 'come', 'alcoholism', 'alcohol', 'hits', 'cent', 'alcoholic', 'aa', 'women', 'aai']","Indeed, leading brands are not hesitant to concede that their markets have expanded, thanks largely to this growing trend.

How about a life beyond Patiala peg! For those wanting to kick the bottle, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is the answer. The AA, which has a worldwide fellowship of over 3 million recovering from alcohol, is celebrating its 60th anniversary in India on May 5.

A ray of hope for the still-suffering alcoholics, the AA has about 300 groups with over 20 in Chandigarh, Mohali, Panchkula, Jalandhar, Batala, Amritsar, Hoshiarpur, Dasuya, Kurali, Ambala, Karnal and Dehradun. Now, the plan is to make the 60th anniversary celebrations a big affair by launching a sustained campaign against alcoholism as the “people’s movement” and help problem drinkers lead a normal life.

Giving a blueprint, an AA representative said the members shared their experiences, strength and hope for the recovery of the still-suffering alcoholics.

Alcoholism has been identified as a disease (as declared by the World Health Orgainsation) with no cure but could be controlled ‘one day at a time’ by the AA’s simple programme which was being underlined at the meetings.

The AA is a fellowship of men and women who get together to work out a common solution to the problem. The only requirement for the membership is the desire to stop drinking. There is no fee. Any alcoholic wanting to quit drinking can contact the Chandigarh Fellowship at the AA helpline 94170-37358.

The AA was started in 1935 in New York (USA) by two alcoholics, who wanted to quit drinking. It is now a worldwide institution and exists in over 185 countries with more than 3 million sober members.","['quit', 'drinking', 'million', 'problem', 'wanting', 'life', 'toast', 'stillsuffering', 'raising', 'aa', 'worldwide', 'fellowship', 'alcoholics']","The AA, which has a worldwide fellowship of over 3 million recovering from alcohol, is celebrating its 60th anniversary in India on May 5.

"Poor me, don’t pour that drink...","TheTribune: AAP MP Bhagwant Mann put alcohol right, left, front and centre in our drawing rooms, chilled with guilt and drowned with apologies with a hangover of repentance.",[],2019-02-04 06:37:00,"Lakhinder Jit Singh Vohra

AAP MP Bhagwant Mann put alcohol right, left, front and centre in our drawing rooms, chilled with guilt and drowned with apologies with a hangover of repentance. Better late than never. Alcoholism is a progressive disease of the mind, an allergy of the body, and a spiritual malady.

The first step in overcoming an alcohol addiction is admitting being powerless and that life has become unmanageable.

I am a recovered alcoholic. My date of sobriety, as it is called in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), is the last time I took a drink — November 24, 2013. I distinctly remember the time and place where I was, when I consciously put the glass down saying enough is enough. My body simply could not take the two or three double Patiala pegs of Double Black Johnnie Walker on the rocks every night. I am sure that if I had not stopped, like many others we hear or know, I would have been dead by now.

A big part of alcoholism, which we often lose sight of, is the people in your life, who aid and abet — the enablers. It could be a coterie of so-called well-wishers, the freely flowing booze at political fundraisers, weddings, bootleg brands behind closed doors, one-for-the-road Army brats. It could also be family members who turn a blind eye and never acknowledge a drinking problem, or show tough love so the alcoholic gets help.

Mann, in a brave act, had showed up with his mother and announced that he was giving up. But for many alcoholics, the cause of drinking is deep-rooted in family and early childhood trauma, lack of an emotional connection with parents or siblings, or family pressures that justify an escape to solitude and drinking.

However, faith in the Almighty; seeking professional help, such as a mental health professional; staying away from booze-filled occasions; clearing out the liquor cabinet… is more tough than half-admitting at a political rally that you are promising to quit, even though you claim you do not have a drinking problem.

In India, you have to be half-apologetic and give many explanations to near and dear ones why you stopped drinking or how bad the drinking problem had gotten! You are made to feel guilty even for quitting! What most people do not realise is that an alcoholic has to say no to the first drink because like most other normal drinkers, once he takes the first drink, he is powerless to say ‘no’. For him, one is too many and one thousand is never enough.

Hope Mann was not trying to draw sympathy in the election season.

Like they say in recovery — poor me, pour me a drink.","['poor', 'drinking', 'problem', 'dont', 'say', 'stopped', 'pour', 'alcoholic', 'tough', 'family', 'professional', 'powerless', 'drink']","My date of sobriety, as it is called in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), is the last time I took a drink — November 24, 2013.

God, grant me the Serenity, to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can, and Wisdom to know the difference... chants out the motley crowd, Aisha, (27) is holding hands with Nimisha (31) who is joined by Vaneet (25), Vinod (42)... and so on.

In today’s world when we talk of diminishing bonds, individuals becoming lonelier...this group that belongs to a cross-section of society, they form a strong support.

‘I am Nehal and I am an alcoholic,’ says a woman in her late 30s, sharing her tale of loneliness; this is followed by ‘Main Suresh hoon aur main ek sharabi hoon’... a man revealing his inhibition of joining the group... no scene from sitcom Mom this is, but one of our many chapters from Alcoholics Anonymous — a group that meets every evening, shares its joys and sorrows, small victories and failures...lending support to each other.

Loneliness pangs

Nehal’s story is that of a woman having made her children centre of her world. As her son entered his teens and daughter joined hostel, she suddenly felt lost. Giving company to her husband on night-outs for a drink became the only ‘high’ of her life, “Before I knew, I was not only gulping down my drinks but also finishing my husband’s,” she admits right in your face. And then she became dependent on anti-depressant till her doctors put her in touch with AA. “Here, I got to know I am not the only one and that there is help.”

Fighting back

“In the society that I come from, alcohol is freely available,” says the tall and slender Niharika. When this fun turned into an obsession, she never realised. Educated in the finest university abroad, moving in circles where liquor is essential part of social life, she is trying taking the reins of life in her own hands. Niharika is banking on exercise and meditation to break her addiction. A tough journey, she feels fortunate that her sponsor (mentor from AA) is standing by her in her fight every single minute. Accompanying this young girl is Suhana, her first day at AA. “I have been trying to come here for last 15 year.” Touched by the support she got on her first day, super-inspired by Bhagwan Das, who celebrated his 18th birthday (18 years of being sober) she knows she is home.

Loss & gain

Not all here at this meeting in a prestigious institution are this privileged. Naresh, when he made to his first AA meeting, was just off the street in stinking clothes and womens’ slippers, which he had no memory where he picked from! Seven years sober, he gets welled-up sharing his story, “These very people welcomed me with open hearts. No judgements, no blame game; they helped me to get back home and reunite with my wife.”

Celebrating life

Meanwhile, the birthday card for Bhagwan circulates and members write messages; a white transparent plastic box for donation takes rounds too. This being the opening evening, those who have their birthdays (having completed a fixed number of years remaining sober) cut the cake as their families join in. A tall, old lady draws our attention. “Her husband was a member of AA; she lost him few years back but has continued to come and mentor families,” we are told. Amen!

Noble cause

Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) originated in 1935 in America. Since then this mutually funded support group has spread across the world. It works in a 12-step programme along with daily meetings. The only requirement to join AA is the desire to stop drinking. One can reach out to AA website.

It’s a disease, no less. Getting rid of alcohol addiction starts and ends with the individual. Muster up the courage, help is at hand

The picturesque resort along the gushing waters of the Beas at Manali provided the perfect backdrop for a cocktail party. However, over 200 cheerful former alcoholics, a majority of them anytime drinkers, along with their families preferred to say “cheers” over a glass of juice or a cup of coffee. The occasion was the 12th Convention of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), that was organised recently.

The motley crowd of recovering alcoholics comprised businessmen, private sector executives, government servants and women professionals. Their transformation had not been sudden. It was the result of a programme of recovery of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), a worldwide fellowship of recovering alcoholics which boasts of a membership of over 30 lakh with over 30,000 sober alcoholics in India alone.

Kicking off one session after another with the prayer “God grant us serenity to accept the things we cannot change, courage to change the things we can and wisdom to know the difference”, various speakers narrated heart-rending stories and how they escaped from the deadly dragnet of alcoholism “one day at a time” through AA’s 12-step recovery programme.

“I have turned to fertiliser from garbage,” a participant, sober for nearly 20 years, summed up the transformation. Through AA, he came to realise that he was not a bad person but a sick person suffering from an incurable progressive disease called alcoholism. However, the disease can be arrested “one day at a time” by attending meetings where the AA members share experiences, strength and hope. The anonymity of the problem drinker is strictly maintained.

What is Alcoholics Anonymous?

Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and hope with each other so that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no dues or fees for AA membership. The members’ primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety.

AA’s 24-hour helpline (094170-37358) or website www.aa.org can help you get rid of alcohol addiction. There is a separate helpline for persons affected by alcoholics’ behaviour at 098155-04686.

FIRST-PERSON ACCOUNT

‘I was drinking all day long, wishing death would come in one blow’

Alcohol does not discriminate between sexes. Women are as much affected as men though women alcoholics face a far graver social stigma. Never once since my late teens did I think I would be able to remain sober for over a month. And, here I am, sober for a few years now. I am a miracle.

Alcohol was once the solution for all my problems. It solved my insecurities, loneliness, anger, sense of not being good enough, being the odd one out everywhere… a few drinks would make all these and so many other thoughts and feelings just disappear. I drank alone and I drank like no one else I knew. Slowly, long before I knew it, alcohol ceased to be my friend and my solution. I was drinking throughout the day and wishing death would come in one blow and end the suffering that life had become. It took me a decade to admit that maybe drinking and my life, being the hell it was, were interlinked!

I couldn’t ask anyone for help. That’s for the weak, I felt. I still don’t remember how I got to hear of AA. God alone knows how, one morning at around 3 am, I got online and noted down a helpline number of AA, got drunk and went to sleep. By now, I had no regular job, stayed with my parents and was unable to even make a sandwich for myself or my son, who was six years old then. I could not taste food, coordinate colours and my movements were awkward. With no choice at all, I declared to myself that I would go and check the drunkards who went to a meeting with a name like AA.

By evening, I was on my knees begging my father to go into the rooms to see whether it was good enough for me. You see, I was dying slowly physically. Mentally and emotionally, I was already dead, but with every bit I had in me, I wanted to know whether the meeting of AA members was up to the mark! I was a woman. I was scared. But unbeknown to me, I had been blessed by the gift of desperation. My father scouted the room for me and came back with the Big Book (basic text of AA). The next day, I went to my first meeting and have never looked back. Being a woman doesn’t stop me from heading to the meeting anywhere now. The members of AA accept me and care for me like my family.

I do not want to ever live that hell I lived in. Going to the meetings, getting a sponsor (to do the AA programme) and learning to practice the AA principles in my day-to-day life is responsible for every good thing in my life today.

Once I stopped drinking, I had my broken life to deal with and nothing to hide behind. I had to find another way to live. That new design of living came to me via my sponsor through the Big Book.

I do not want to remember my last drink but I do remember that unbearable pain. I don’t have that today. I don’t wake up and have that big black hole in my soul anymore. Now, I lead a good, full life.

Alcoholism brought me to my knees because it led me to the gates of hell and yet I couldn’t stop drinking. Today I can. I have some tools, steps and some friends who actually like me. This programme gives me the opportunity to be the woman that God wants me to be.

IAF faces HC ire for confining corporal to psychiatric ward for alcohol dependency,"TheTribune: NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force (IAF) faced the ire of the Delhi High Court on Thursday for confining one of its non-commissioned officers, a corporal, to a psychiatric ward for over two months, because he was an alcoholic and suffered from mental disorders.",['Tribune News Service'],2018-07-12 21:45:00,"New Delhi, July 12

The Indian Air Force (IAF) faced the ire of the Delhi High Court on Thursday for confining one of its non-commissioned officers, a corporal, to a psychiatric ward for over two months, because he was an alcoholic and suffered from mental disorders.

A Bench of justices S Muralidhar and Vinod Goel questioned the rationale behind the IAF’s decision, asking how it determined on a daily basis that the corporal still “craved for alcohol”.

The court also said the newly-enacted Mental Health Act made it clear that a person could not be forced to undergo treatment without his consent, adding that the IAF “cannot ignore the laws of the country”.

Terming the conduct of the IAF “irresponsible”, the Bench wondered how many of such cases there might be, which were yet to be highlighted.

“How were you determining on a daily basis that his craving for alcohol had not gone down? What tests were conducted by you? This is completely irresponsible. We wonder how many such cases are there.

“This is a clear case where a man is saying he has been detained without consent. Under the new Mental Health Act, you cannot force him to undergo treatment without his consent. Then how are you pumping him full of drugs? We do not know who should be proceeded against,” the Bench said.

It added that the IAF needed to be reminded not to interfere with a person’s liberty as “short of chaining him up, everything else was done here” and directed that the corporal be produced in court tomorrow.

According to the IAF, represented by the Centre’s standing counsel, Ripudaman Singh Bhardwaj, the action against the corporal was taken on a complaint from his wife that he turned violent after consuming alcohol.

Bhardwaj said the corporal, Kriyad Yogesh Bhankhariya, had alcohol dependency issues for which he was initially treated in the psychiatric ward of the Army Base Hospital here and thereafter, in June, he was shifted to the medical centre at the Tughlakabad Air Force Station.

The court said if the non-commissioned officer (NCO) was an alcoholic, then the IAF ought to have sought the help of the “Alcoholics Anonymous” on how to deal with the matter as any psychiatric would confirm that confinement of a person was advisable only in extreme cases.

“It is worrying, the manner in which you have approached the situation,” the Bench told the IAF.

The court was hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by the 30-year-old corporal’s father, claiming that his son was being illegally confined at the Army Base Hospital. —PTI","['undergo', 'corporal', 'iaf', 'confining', 'psychiatric', 'mental', 'alcohol', 'ward', 'bench', 'dependency', 'force', 'faces', 'hc', 'consent', 'court', 'ire']","New Delhi, July 12The Indian Air Force (IAF) faced the ire of the Delhi High Court on Thursday for confining one of its non-commissioned officers, a corporal, to a psychiatric ward for over two months, because he was an alcoholic and suffered from mental disorders.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,[],2001-06-11 00:00:00,"

CHANDIGARH CALLING F OR the first time in past couple of years the Shramdaan  voluntary effort to manually de-silt the Sukhna lake in Chandigarh  received a good response from city residents as well as officials of the Chandigarh Administration. Senior officials of the administration made it a point to go to the lake each morning. Students of schools and colleges also did exemplary work at Sukhna Lake in desilting. These included Govt Sr Sec School, Sector 21; Industrial Training Institute, Sector 28; Sri Guru Gobind Singh College, Sector 26; Director, NSS, Chd; Panjab University; DAV Model School, Sector 15; Govt Sr Sec School, Sector 18; Dev Samaj School, Sector 21; Govt High School, Sector 7; and Govt College of Education, Sector 20, Chandigarh. Departments and organisations also stepped up their efforts to save Sukhna  one of the famous tourist spots and favourite destination of the morning walkers. Among the major participants were the engineering department, UT power generation giant Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB), Army Engineers, the Haryana drainage department and the Punjab drainage department. Last week the administration honoured 43 city residents who regularly come to participate in the shramdaan. The local MP, Mr Pawan Kumar Bansal, had sent in six tippers ( earth excavating machines) costing about Rs 45 lakh from his MP Local Area Development Fund to be used for Municipal Corporation work as well as in shramdaan at lake. The administration roped in sponsors like CITCO, MILKFED, Haryana Dairy Development, ICICI Bank, Quark, Talwar Dairy, Hotel & Restaurant Association of Chandigarh and Shiv Bhandar Sector 26. Defiling of Sukhna The serene Sukhna lake, hitherto a haven for joggers, health freaks, casual visitors and, of course, the weary Chandigarhians, who flock to seek momentary reprieve from the blazing winds and the stressful city life, is fast shaping up into a place of pandemonium and trash-dumping ground. People can be seen sauntering around along with their pets. The presence of these canines keep the passersby on their toes to meet an eventuality. The over-enthusiastic joggers do not use the track earmarked for them. They can be seen jog-trotting and jostling away with a jumbled crowd of visitors, especially during their evening promenade. Some even do aerobic exercises on the lake lawns. Picnickers, too, contribute their mite in defiling these well-manicured lawns by littering away bread and biscuit wrappings and other refuse. The gutka and paan-chewing clan makes it all the more ugly and unsightly. Cigarette butts and half-burnt beeries can be seen scattered around despite the provision of refuse-bins. The undaunted few cross all parameters of sanity by surreptitiously slipping into the bushes, adjacent to the jogging track, and easing themselves. The children entertainment corner, confectionery and refreshment joints, more often than not, remain crowded due to their close proximity. The light music played to enthral music-lovers becomes a misnomer as the melodious tunes die down in the deafening din of the milling crowd storming these hotspots. Is the Chandigarh Administration listening? Pressing problem Chandigarhs straight talking Administrator, Lieut Gen J.F. R. Jacob (Retd), known not to mince words, has done it again. He has asked officials to re-deploy surplus staff of the Government Printing Press in other departments of the Chandigarh where a staff shortage exists. In Chandigarh, despite its small size, several cadres of employees working in various departments exist. But due to some short-sightedness of the bureaucracy about three decades ago none of the employees is inter -transferable. This in a way breeds contempt for the rules as the employees know that they will never be shifted out. Merging of all cadres and forming a uniform cadre has been on the cards for long. In case of the government press it is brimming with additional staff and once modernisation is carried out more and more employees will be surplus. Sample this the binding section of the press has 158 government employees. With the Government of India not sanctioning any new posts the idea seems right to re-deploy employees in other places. However, employees true to their sarkari upbringing reacted sharply. Their union issued a statement that efforts should be made to bring work to the press. The employees probably need to be told that more work will require better quality of machines and these machines need an even smaller workforce to run. And all this ruckus is being raised even as the administration has said that employees status as government servants will be protected. A discrimination Why does the Chandigarh Housing Board make distinction between the general power of attorney (GPA) holders of the flat allotted under the discretionary quota and under the general quota for the purpose of getting the flat transferred in the name of the GPA holders, asks a Chandigarhian. Earlier the Housing Board used its discreet at the time of allotment of a flat under the quota and now it discriminates by imposing such undesirable restriction, and on both the account, the sufferer is the common man. So over to the Chandigarh Administrator, Lt. Gen (Retd) J.F.R. Jacob for saving the commoner from a feeling of his being beaten twice. Such condition of barring the GPA holder of flat allotted under the discretionary quota should be removed immediately. Drawing the line The Chandigarh traffic police has started a special drive to check motorists who are in habit of jumping the red light. For the purpose, special naakas are being set up near the various traffic light points. Help of plain cloth police personnel is also taken to apprehend the jumpers. However, polices own house is not in order. The mandatory stop line and zebra crossing is missing at several traffic light points in the city. There is no such line or crossing at the busy Transport Chowk light points. The pedestrian crossing signboard is lying on the ground (see photo on top of the page by Manoj Mahajan). There are several other light points where the stopline and zebra crossing are missing, including the one near the Panjab University gate. Interestingly, on the newly erected light points, the authorities concerned forgot to mark the line and crossing  traffic light point on the dividing road of Sectors 24 is an example. Urban biodiversity The Environment Society of India (ESI) is launching a campaign to plant the saplings of mangoes (Mangifera indica) in about 450 mango groves in Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali. The sites on which these towns were built were dotted with mango trees. Although the trees preservation order, 1952, issued by the Capital project authority, Chandigarh, has saved many mango groves in Chandigarh, yet several mango trees have collapsed due to old age and storms. For example, the number of mango trees in the city birds sanctuary in 1989 was 20, now the number has gone down to eight only. Besides, the ESI has urged the Chandigarh administration, HUDA and PUDA to reduce the use of pesticides and chemicals. The sparrows die when they take the dead flies killed by insecticide bait. Similarly chemical fogging operations have an adverse effect on useful insects like bees, glowworms, butterflies etc. In old cities the people used to put up earthen jars on the house tops and spread grain and water for the birds. The ESI will launch educational campaign asking the citizens to place birdbaths and feed the birds. These actions will promote biodiversity. Punjabi pride It was a moment of pride for the Punjabi theatre buffs when the Punjabi musical play Shaheed-e-azam Bhagat Singh was successfully staged at one of Indias best auditoriums  The Abhinav Theatre, Jammu. The play was staged to mark the conclusion of inter-state Prithviraj Kapoor Theatre Festival on the 29th death anniversary of the doyen of Hindi cinema. The play was so well rated that its two performances were staged under the festival organised by National Theatre Arts Society  one at Jammu and another at Pathankot. The cynosure of all eyes during the festival was the director couple Pran and Sunita Sabbharwal, who were even honoured by Mr Harbans Singh, Minister for Youth Services and Sports, Jammu and Kashmir. The script of the play was written by Sunita herself and the cast included a number of local actors also. The shows were sponsored by North Zone Cultural Centre, Patiala. This was perhaps the first time a Punjabi play was getting such a tremendous response in another state. This is just a step towards strengthening Punjabi theatre. No speed limit boards Although the Administrations engineering wing has done a lot of good to the residents of Sectors 33, 34, 44 and 45 by repairing the dividing roads, it needs to be reminded that the speed limit signboards are yet to be put back. About two months back when work on these roads started, these signboards had been removed to facilitate the repairs. But these have not been restored. The result is lack of awareness about the speed to be maintained in these areas. Residents also take it easy by driving as fast as they want to and nothing much can be done about this problem. The reason being the excuse that there is no indication about the limit to be maintained. The indications should be made available at the earliest lest lives of people should be endangered. Labour of love It was a brave and wise act on the part of Colonel Hoshiar Singh Yadav (retd), a resident of Category I in Modern Housing Complex, Manimajra, who initiated the effort of having a long barricade in the lane of garages located at the back of the multi-storeyed flats built eight years back. All these years, the residents of the Duplex (Independent) houses which came into being much after the Multistoreyed flats, had always preferred to cross these garages lane in order to reach the main shopping complex. This had resulted in fast moving vehicles both four and two wheeler endangering the children and adults, specially during late evening hours since there was no lighting in these garages. Col Yadav helped by other residents of the block then put up a proposal to the Chandigarh Housing Board for their help. But the latter told them to get the barricades built at their own cost since the lane was a private property of the occupants and the CHB cannot made it a public passage. The barricades built with iron pipes have now benefited directly the residents of eight blocks of category I, each having 24 flats, thus a total of 192 flats. All this was done by Col Yadav and other residents of this block at their own expenses. But surprisingly they are yet to get any financial support from other block residents who benefited by this societal cause. Distress call Two weeks back, we wrote about 30-year-old Tulsi Devi who required a double valve transplant and was in dire need of money. We received a spontaneously tremendous response from readers and there were letters from far off places offering help. The story of Jamuna Devi, who belongs to Hamirpur district in Himachal Pradesh, is somewhat similar. She suffers from a serious heart ailment. Her husband, Vinod Kumar, is out of job and the couple has two children. In short, the story is heart rending. As per the estimate given by the Cardiology Department, PGI, Jamuna Devi urgently requirs Rs 1,75,000 to undergo an ASD device closure. And all those who wish to extend their help can contact at 221-A, Sector 14, Chandigarh. Dr R.C. Sobti Dr R.C. Sobti, Professor and founding Chairman (1989-2000) of the Department of Biotechnology, Panjab University, has been unanimously elected President of the Punjab Academy of Sciences. The academy is responsible for development of science in Punjab. It has dignatories like Prof Yash Paul, Prof R.P. Bambah, Prof R.C. Mahajan and other senior scientists as its Fellows. Dr Sobti has so far been the vice-president of the prestigious organisation. Sentinel

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,[],2001-07-29 00:00:00,"Alcoholic Anonymous  kindles hope for alcoholics

Shivani Bhakoo Ludhiana, July 28

Not many may know it, but there is a forum that provides men and women a platform where they share their experiences, strengths and hopes to overcome alcoholism. Hundreds of men and women who could hardly walk two straight steps due to excessive drinking have not only given up their drinking habits but are leading a normal life  all thanks to Alcoholic Anonymous, a voluntary rehabilitation programme which is encouraging several alcoholics to regain full control of their lives. Alcoholic Anonymous, a non- profit voluntary organisation, has already spread its wings all over the world with an encouraging response. The organisation with its origin in the USA was brought to India in the late fifties. There are estimated to be about 350 voluntary groups in India in which over 6,500 workers encourage people to stop drinking. These groups do not belong to any sect, denomination, political, parties organisations or institutions. Nor do they engage in any controversy. The prime objective of its members is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety. Gurdeep Singh, who was an alcoholic a few years back, is today away from the first fatal drink. Gurdeep was born to his parents after 14 years of their marriage. I was a pampered child. During these 14 years, my parents visited various temples, mosques and tied threads. I was put in the best school of the city, my father expired when I was in the ninth standard, he said. During his university days, Gurdeep never went to any shop or bar to have a drink. His life was changed when he went to Mumbai for his job training. According to Gurdeep, real life began in Mumbai. No relatives, no well-wishers. He could do whatever he wanted. He became very popular amongst friends. Time passed with lots of hard work and drinking and dancing. His alcoholic intake progressed and capacity increased tremendously. Slowly and slowly, my breakfast, lunch and dinner turned out to be neat pegs. I felt myself on the top of the world, he said. His life took a drastic turn. Gurdeep met with a number of accidents. While once he was drunk, he promised somebody to get married. He married the girl and promised not to touch alcohol again. He started losing his jobs one after the other. There were regular fights with wife and in-laws. Now, when he was in a tight grip of alcohol, even if he wanted to stop drinking, he could not. By this time, all the property, jobs, respect, health and self-respect was on the road. I met one of my friends who suggested me to go to Alcoholic Anonymous which has changed my entire life. For me, not drinking for over 11 years is like a world record. I can eat, I love to sleep and I am contented and happy, said Gurdeep Singh. The therapeutic value of one alcoholic helping another is unparalleled here, said Ranjit (not his real name). On the eve of his commission into the Defence Force, he was kicked out of the academy because he bashed up his senior after a bout of drinking. Virtually on the roads after being disowned by his relatives, he became more chronic alcoholic till he found help from Alcoholic Anonymous. Its been three years now. Ranjit has not touched the bottle. Sunil, under peer pressure of alcohol, left his wife, sold household goods, and committed a dacoity once to get a bottle of alcohol. He said, on one lucky day, I came across some friends who had got over this problem. I also went into the programme, and I would complete three years of sobriety in January 2002. According to the preamble of this organisation, the only requirement for the membership of the Alcoholic Anonymous is a desire to stop drinking. It has several centers that include Ludhiana, Chandigarh, Jalandhar, Amritsar, Nangal, Sundernagar and Shimla. In Ludhiana twice a week these people meet in the compound of Sacred Heart Convent School, Jamalpur.

You are trying to save for the New Years eve big bash, but the universe seems to be conspiring to tempt you into spending. Worry not, helps here!

Purva Grover I ts not even the middle of the month and your ATM card reads low balance. The moolah that came in on Diwali went away as easily as it came in. And now, your buddies are planning a big bash on December 31, for which you have to make a contribution. Plus, there is the ideal designer outfit that you spotted in a window last week. Hmm now the issue is, as always, to save money. And, you are quite good at it. For, you do it every time theres a birthday, a holiday or a party to attend. So, you decide to get back to your diet of noodles and sandwiches to save bucks. Wait, what if we tell you that there are smarter ways of living on a shoestring budget. Dont believe us? Well, take a clue from smart tips here and see the content of your piggybank grow each day: * You are bankrupt and thats leaving you sad. Now, we all know that a retail therapy works wonder when it comes to cheering you up. But, it lightens both your mood and your wallet. So, heres a way to indulge without spending. Hunt for outfits, shoes, belts, shades and everything else you wish to have in your best pal, cousin or neighbours wardrobe. With her permission of course, and a promise, that youll let her do the same when she is penniless and is dying to buy a new dress. * Each time your mom and aunt talk about how they picked up a dozen of oranges for Rs 2 less, you label it as silly conversation. But well, heres your chance to gain from the bargain talk. Pick on easy tips from them and haggle for the best deal. Dont be embarrassed to fight for a rupee. After all its your hard-earned money. * Your idea of celebration is to drink in a fancy pub, but then it costs huge bucks. So, keep your eyes wide open and enjoy a drink at places that offer discounts. Say, pay a little more and change your cola for a chilled beer. Or order two vodkas and get a peanut salad free. Or, buy a bottle of Old Monk, preferably from CSD, grab a packet of wafers, troop into a buddys place, make a bonfire and have a splendid low-budget evening! * Hate waking up in the morning to wash your car? But paying 200 bucks to the cleaner also pinches. Strike a deal with your friend or the cute-guy in the neighbourhood and take turns to wash it or maybe do it together. * And see, if you are an Indian, a true Indian, then the word FREE should be enough to lure you. So grab all those samples that come with magazines, products and even the ones that are distributed in the local market. Trust us, the orange juice tastes best when it comes absolutely free and the detergent too cleans the better when the salesman gives it as a free gift. * Okie, now this may sound unexciting, but not all freebies are sub-standard and boring. Buy a shower gel that gives a loofah free or denims that give branded pair of socks free.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,[],2009-05-25 00:00:00,"City Scope Letters

Right blend clicked for Congress This refers to the City Scope The Congress has it! (May 18) by Raveen Thukral in which he has rightly said -The Congress has it. Really, for the first time since 1991, the party got clear majority, which was not expected this time. Though Congress is likely to provide us a stable government, I still fear if it would be able to deliver the expected. We have to discuss what brought the Congress to power. Apart from Modi and Karat there were several other factors too. I think this is a negative vote towards opposition and regional parties. They arm-twisted and never worked or allowed to work. So part of the blame comes on Karat and others. But minus the Red parties will the Congress perform? What Mamta has done in Bengal if done elsewhere, will it not hinder the progress? We should be happy that the Congress has got a better share of votes. The real deciphering of the election result is still due. We should also wait to see whether Sonia would be able to control the party and deliver for the welfare of the people. In the present circumstances, rising prices, meltdown and corruption are the major challenges for the Congress. I feel that there are chances that this government might tilt either way- it could be a big failure or a complete success. Kumar Gaurav, Chandigarh II The heading of this week City Scope should be The people have it instead of The Congress has it. It is not the Congress but the people who have done it. After many years of testing, people have rejected the leaders of fragmented regional parties, who claimed to be ruling the nation by a proxy presence. The results are simply unbelievable. All those who were putting Manmohan Sarkar to ransom have been thrown away. Though the Congress has thrown out Lalu and Karat, still Mamta and DMK are there to nail them. After twenty years people have voted for a single party and we hope that the party politics will stay here. The young factor has played well in the election. People have shown their faith for a stable government. Keshav, Chandigarh III People of India have given a clear mandate to the UPA to put an end to the political instability. The exit polls by the electronic media became a futile exercise. The Indian voters became wise while casting their votes for the right candidate. They rejected the national, regional parties, the third and the fourth front. The UPA government should think about growth by providing more jobs. The government must think of ways to control population so as to curb poverty. It should also check the price rise of essential commodities especially those of domestic use. The left parties, SP and other allies of the UPA should support the new government. People had lost confidence in the left parties and the BJP. They wanted to see good governance and better quality of life. The government should consider the predictions of the World Bank, which has warned that people would live under extreme poverty, in 2015. Dr Manmohan Singh who is considered a great economist has thus several challenges to meet. M L Garg, Chandigarh IV Its aptly analysed that the middle class, the youth and the Muslim vote that has helped the Congress and the UPA to emerge winners. Thus, proving all the exit polls and the poll pundits wrong. No one, including the players- the Congress and its allies- had an inclination that the pre-poll alliance would emerge strongly. Several other factors played a crucial role too. The Congress could muster the youth support because of Rahul Gandhi. The middle class polled for the honesty of Dr Manmohan Singh and trusted him to deal with the economic slowdown, safeguard the economy and pave way for growth and development. The Communists because of their outdated policies and programmes failed to protect the interests of the poor, weaker and the middle class. Their opposition of the Indo-US nuclear deal, too, went against them and thus their middle class and youth vote bank went against them. Harbans Singh Chopra, Mohali V The results of this years elections are unexpected. Since 1991, elections had been opting for fractured majority that created an impression that coalition governments would stay and power of regional parties was increasing. Things took a bad shape to an extent that disgruntled politicians played the worst politics. But, our democracy is strong and hence, the voters have shown the door to all sorts of manipulators. It has been mentioned by the writer that Modi and Karat factors eased the situation for the Congress. The Varun factor, blame game and Advanis greed to capturing the highest post has led to the BJPs downfall. The criticism of the Prime Minister has also worked in favour of the congress. The UPA is now in full force and I am sure that it will work. A wise man rightly said Manmohan SinghS would keep the seat hot for about two years and then the young leader would come. The Sonia factor will work and people are likely to get relief in the future. Rahul once said only ten paise out of one rupee reaches the right place, so will the UPA help the people to get more out of remaining 90 paise. As prices of routine products have increased, will the UPA be able to reduce the Consumer Price Index. They should learn that if they do not perform then the coming elections will be hard to win. R K Garg, Chandigarh VI Ideology and practice led to debacles of the BJP and Left parties. Mr Thukral has rightly said the figure of 260 seats for the Congress-led UPA was not predicted by any of the exit polls. Such a victory, especially when prices of essential commodities are skyrocketing, was not expected by the Congress or the UPA allies. The victory of the UPA de facto is not the victory of the Congress but is complete polarisation of politics in the BJP and the Left, particularly at the expense of regional parties. The communal cards of the BJP and the Leftists hide and seek policy led to their debacles. The BJP and the Left failed as their ideologies did not reflect aspirations of the voters and the tactics they followed during the campaign alienated their supporters as well. Also, the mandate has discarded the regional parties and parties like the LJP, the PDP, the MNS and the RPI could not open their accounts. The parties have not announced any concrete national policies and programmes for the people, moreover, all parties indulged in mudslinging. Though Varun Gandhi attained victory in Pilibhit, it was an overall defeat for the BJP . The corruption crisis in the Kerala unit of the CPM has been unprecedented. The Left Front governments in West Bengal and Kerala claim that private investment is required to generate jobs. Nandigram and Singur have raised serious doubts about the Left Front governments ability to attract private investment to West Bengal. The party leadership has all these years educated its cadre that private capital is inimical to the interests of the people and should be resisted at all costs. How long can a party remain trapped by the contradiction between ideology and practice. Further, the Left unsuccessfully tried to form a Third Alternative with those parties which were a part of the NDA under the BJP earlier. In the last general elections, when the NDA sought votes on the Indian Shining slogan, this led the next UPA government to focus on inclusive growth. Booming stock markets or upbeat economic data do not reflect the true picture of the country. Poverty alleviation requires long-term planning, increased spending on education, health and infrastructure and political commitment. Benefits of growth have to be evenly shared. This is a time for introspection, not only for the BJP/Left but for the Congress as well. The BJP and the Left, hopefully, will reformulate their politics to offer a constructive opposition in the Parliament. It is the time to consolidate the gains for the Congress. SK Khosla, Chandigarh VII Mr. Raveen has rightly highlighted the reasons that have brought in unexpected did not take the arrogance and obstinacy exhibited by Karat and his comrades on the issue of the Indo-US Nuclear Deal and the sustained, irrational opposition to the reforms that the Prime Minister wanted to usher in. Karat basically tried to create hurdles for the UPA as their party even propped up Mayawatis name as the next Prime Minister, knowing well that she has a dubious reputation for collecting funds. The BJP, also, did not help its own cause by tearing in to Manmohan Singh at a personal level. The Opposition, it seemed had no issues other than personal hatred for the Gandhi family and a scholarly and a dignified Prime Minister. The electorate, has very rightly, given them the boot ! M K Bajaj, Chandigarh VIII I do agree that it is combination of the middle class, the youth and the Muslim vote that has done the trick for the Congress and the UPA. People had taught a bitter lesson to the Communists this year who had stabbed the government over the issue of the nuclear deal by withdrawing their support at the crucial time. The voters had not forgotten the ugly episode and paid them back the same coin by routing them from the political field entirely. This gave an advantage to the Congress. Moreover, the BJP lost its reputation due to the fielding of LK Advani as its prime ministerial candidate, who indulged in unnecessary war-of-words with Manmohan Singh. Also, due to the communal policies of the BJP, the public had felt disgusted that was again an advantage for the Congress. Whereas, the Modi factor did tilt the Muslim votes in favour of the Congress and the UPA. The Third Front was certainly hub of power-hungry politicians who wanted to take over the reigns of the country, as has been aptly described by Mr. Thukral. This factor had turned the voters, especially the youth in favour of the Congress and the UPA. In totality, the voters were more educated than the politicians who wisely voted for a stable and a strong government at the Centre.

Anuja Jaiswal

Tribune News Service Chandigarh, December 27

The literal translation of the Hindi word asha is hope, but practically Asha -- a helpline started by the UT administration to help depressed people in the city -- is hopeless. The aim of the ambitious 24-hour helpline, started in 2004, was to counsel people suffering from depression or having suicidal tendencies and preventing them from taking the fatal step. However, after initial success, official apathy has taken its toll on the helpline which needs support if the administration intends to continue with it. After a complaint from a conscientious citizen, Col Mehndiratta (retd), that the helpline was not working, The Tribune made inquiries and found that the project was hardly functional. On the morning of December 25, Mehndiratta had spotted a youth, who appeared disoriented, moving about aimlessly in Sector 11, Panchkula. Mehndiratta, after a brief chat with him (name withheld on request), realised that the youth was apparently depressed and needed counselling. Since Mehndiratta was aware of Asha helpline, he immediately called them up. However, he did not get any response. I must have called them up over two dozen times, but no one answered the phone, he said. To crosscheck these claims, this correspondent called up on ASHA helpline several times over the past two days but the calls were not answered, except once. However, the woman who answered the call was of no help as she point blankly refused to counsel anyone on phone or at the residence of the person in need of psychological help. She even refused to admit the patient on the plea that the doctor was not available for the next few days. When contacted, Dr Vijay Girdhar, psychiatrist at the Civil Hospital, Mani Majra, who heads the helpline, admitted that he was not available in the hospital for the past two days as he had been out of station to attend a conference. He also admitted that the helpline phone numbers were non-functional for the past few days, but were now operational. We dont have facilities like the GMCH-32. We are running the helpline, but dont have infrastructure for intensive care, as it is a primary health care-cum-civil hospital. Even we cannot help abandoned and mentally ill persons with high risk of suicide, Dr Girdhar admitted. He said, the department of psychiatry of the Government Medical College and Hospital, which was assigned the task of running it earlier, was not only running a helpline to counsel depressed people and tackle those suffering from suicidal tendencies, it also provided additional service of the Community Intervention Team (CIT). He, however, said this was not possible at this hospital. The CIT helped distressed, abandoned and mentally ill persons with high risk of suicide, to reach the protected and caring environment of the hospital. CIT had trained staff, a counsellor and a staff nurse, an ambulance with a driver, who had been trained to assist CIT staff in resuscitation and transportation of people with multiple injuries and fractures, said Dr Girdhar. Besides, the team was also summoned if a person had taken overdoses of drugs, put his life to threat or even to counsel people with high suicidal tendencies, he added. The psychiatry department of the civil hospital has no such facilities and no separate ward for such patients. We are restricted to attend calls only and counsel the patients on phone. However, we sometime face problems due to absence of required staff, said Dr Girdhar. Now, the question is if the hospital was not equipped with infrastructure to handle the helpline, why did the UT administration shift it out of GMCH-32, where it functioned effectively for more than four years? Dr Raj Bhadur, director-principal of the GMCH-32 said it was a decision of the Director Health Services (DHS) as this project was funded under the District Mental Health Programme.","['dr', 'girdhar', 'hospital', 'asha', 'chandigarh', 'helpline', 'tribune', 'counsel', 'help', 'staff', 'india', 'phone', 'mehndiratta']","Asha helpline cries for helpAnuja JaiswalTribune News Service Chandigarh, December 27The literal translation of the Hindi word asha is hope, but practically Asha -- a helpline started by the UT administration to help depressed people in the city -- is hopeless.

Alcoholic Anonymous comes of age

Rahul Das

Tribune News Service Ambala, September 25

The Ambala chapter of the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) seems to have come of age. Not only has it succeeded in helping many to leave alcohol, the local chapter of AA is all set to organise the first-ever public information meeting here in less than a weeks time. The public information meeting is likely to be a path-breaking initiative, as those who have left alcohol for good are going to be role models for alcoholics. Although apparently the holding of a public information meeting may look like a simple task, there is going to be courage involved on part of those reformed alcoholics who are going to set an example for others. We are going to stand up in front of the gathering and tell them about alcoholism and how one can recover. And perhaps there cannot be a better example than us, who have managed to leave alcohol, he said. The special public information meeting, which is going to be held on August 29 at GMN College, Ambala Cantonment, is also going to mark the second anniversary of the Ambala chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous. Having started by only two persons, the chapter has grown from strength and strength. The success of the Ambala chapter of AA has led to another AA chapter being opened in Karnal. As a matter of fact, a businessman from Karnal had read a report on the Ambala chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous in Chandigarh Tribune and had joined up here. After reading the report in this paper, I came to the Ambala chapter. With their support, I have been going sober for the past couple of months, and now we have opened a chapter in Karnal so that more people can leave alcohol, the businessman said. The president of the Ambala chapter of Alcoholic Anonymous said that a number of participants are expected to attend the public information meeting. Alcoholic Anonymous members from Chandigarh, Punjab, including Jalandhar, Batala, Amritsar and Nangal and Haryana, including Karnal and Panchkula, are likely to attend the special meeting, he said. He stated that the meeting will be an effort to generate awareness about alcoholism. We are also reaching out to different organisations so that those who are suffering from alcoholism can recover. The WHO had declared in 1956 that alcoholism is a disease. The American Medical Association and the British Medical Association have accepted it as a treatable disease, he pointed out. An Alcoholic Anonymous member said that AA is a fellowship of men and women who share their experiences, strength and hopes with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no dues or fee for AA membership. We are self-supporting through our own contribution. Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety, he said.

Tribune News Service S wanky cars, a plush house and money to buy all that catches fancy. And a brush with fame while notching up a few points on celebrity quotient. It may not be a socially-desirable list of must-haves, but it does ring a familiar bell. Suddenly, it has become right and even fashionable to dream of a lifestyle that hitherto was the prerogative of the select few who had well-heeled parents. The ""generation-now"" (instant gratification and living in present are the distinguishing characteristics of this generation), has delightfully ripped apart all older taboos. It is ready to give a hurried burial to all self-conscious stirrings about good people dont aspire for riches and pricey branded wears. And the ""gen-now"" does not mind revising its ""wealthy is wise and branded is bright"" stance if it disturbs the peace of mind!



""Work hard, strive hard and enjoy to the hilt the fruits of your labour. And create your own oasis of happiness. Why be apologetic about being rich and famous?"" says Sugandha Mishra, who has made a name for herself in music vocal. ""You can manifest your dreams and aspirations. For me, music is a journey and not the destination,"" she adds. A lifestyle that offers ""good things of life"" and a good measure of financial comfort does not strike a discordant note with this young singer, who has a penchant for designer wear and costume jewellery. Having ambitions and markedly ambitious ambitions is no longer frowned upon. ""The more, the better"" is the pulse of the day. ""Theres so much to do. And a long way to go. I have to take my business to its zenith. This is just the beginning for me. I have been planning weddings, receptions and birthday parties for the citys crème de la crème , but I have to expand my business, introduce newer concepts for theme parties and add variety to decoration styles,"" gushes Ritu Sidhu, proprietor of Party Bells, an event management company.

For Navraj Hans, the son of singer Hans Raj Hans, fame is something he has been a privy to since his childhood. He has seen his father feted and felicitated a number of times. ""I want to be popular like my father,"" he says, as a matter of fact. ""I have had the best that I could expect as a child  all sorts of luxuries, costliest musical instruments, foreign education and overseas trips, all thanks to my dad. I, too, want to win the hearts of audiences not only in Punjab, but also outside India. I have been practising hard for four to five hours a day,"" Navraj explains. Its not that ""generation-now"" wants things (read success) on a platter. They dont mind sweating it out. But its not a sweat-gone-awry  everything has to be planned meticulously and diligently. ""I will launch myself through an album at some appropriate time, may be after a year or two,"" says Navraj, adding, ""Cultural festivals have certainly boosted my confidence. I have come to know about my competitors and my own strong points."" Goal-orientation is the keyword for many like Kanwalpreet, a gold medalist in the recently-held Afro-Asian Games, and international hockey player. He aspires to take part in the forthcoming Olympics. He practises rigorously under his coach, Mr Mohan Singh. ""I get up early and reach Guru Gobind Singh Stadium by 6 am. Then I have two hours of focused practice.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,[],2006-05-05 00:00:00,"Does the city have a sports culture? Sansarpur saga, with its magical success in hockey, made Jalandhar a sports hub. Anuradha Shukla speaks to a cross section of sports personalities to know if the city is living up to its past glory





Rajbir Kaur, the Golden Girl of Hockey She credits the former sports wings in schools for making the city as sports hub. On the women sports, she feels that it is highly neglected with the complete absence of academies, wings or any department for developing the skills of women sportspersons. According to her, the sports wings earlier had helped the girls from rural areas in developing their sports skills as these used to help them feel comfortable in coming and staying in hostels and avail facilities to go all out and perform. The total lack of attention or facilities for the female sportspersons is affecting their performance in the states like Punjab. Merely promoting games for the men and ignoring the section cannot develop sports culture,she says. The awareness among parents about sports for women is not translated into results because of the lack of facilities that resulted into the sportswomen taking up the sports at the time when it is required to help them get admissions or jobs only, she feels.





Palwinder Kaur, kabaddi coach The sports centers, and the former sports wings in schools have served as fertile nursery for sports talent. Over the years, these have created unique sports culture, wherein persons like me have come from remote rural backgrounds and done well, she says. The city is a positive example of how the sports talent from different regions has been absorbed to make it the hub of sports activities. Parents from rural centers do not hesitate to send their wards to the city, as there are maximum hostel facilities available here, she says. With the reopening of the sports wings in schools and colleges by the state sports department, which were closed for the past few years, the scene is set to liven up once again. The colleges like the HMV have been allotted sports wings and this has greatly enthused the sporting fraternity. The wings will once again provide much needed channel for the sports talent to come up. This time, the government has provided more funds and infrastructure for the wings, which is a welcome step.





Ram Pratap, athletics coach He rates Jalandhar the best when it comes to sports, as, he says, the city provides the maximum facilities for any sports activity as compared to other cities of Punjab. The increasing facilities have brought more and more games to the city over the years. Ram Pratap, the athletics guru and the president of the Punjab Coaches Association, does not feel bad about the attitude of the youths from the poor and rural families of Punjab, who take to sports to get settled with a good job. He says it only encourages sports. Once in secure jobs, the urge to work for the victory of the country increases, he feels. In athletics, the sports stars like Olympian Manjit Kaur and Rajwinder Kaur have proved their mettle despite the lack of attention for women sports, he says. The intake of sportspersons into the police, the BSF and other government departments also encourages sports activities in the city. He also feels that the so-called urbanite games like badminton, table tennis, snooker, and cricket are now drawing children from the urban middle class families in the city.





Jaspal Singh, football coach Being the centre for professional teams like the Punjab Police, BSF, CRPF, and for various colleges like the KMV, HMV, Lyallpur Khalsa and the DAV, and at school level, the city makes the sports scene very dynamic, he says. The sports culture lives in the city with various Olympians and Asian-level players residing here, he feels. Jaspal Singh, the noted football coach from Lyallpur Khalsa College, says that the parents from the city, specially from the middle class, are sending their children towards sports, as they think the field is more professional in approach and would help their children get money or jobs easily. The working of sports wings in schools, sports departments of colleges, academies and the clubs adds to the sporting charm of the city, he says. He stresses on the fact that more work needs to be done at the grass-roots level. However, he rues that this is not being done because of faulty government policies.





Om Prakash, swimming coach As far as the sports activities are concerned, the city, in his eyes, is the number one. The stalwarts of hockey produced by the villages like Sansarpur add to the sporting charm of the city, he says. However, he feels that swimming and gymnastics are the corner sports here as the city lacks the facilities for these games. Om Prakash, a coach with the Sports College here, has witnessed the sports scene in the city being revived over the past three years. He has been credited with many success stories like Rohit Jamba, Gagandeep Kaur and Chandeep Singh from the city. He feels that the inclination of the people towards the games is more highlighted by the media. The number of Olympians in games like hockey produced by the city also pushes children into these games, he feels. The more conscious parents want their children to adopt sports. On the parents attitude, he says that most of the people coming to him for giving training to their children want their wards to be tension-free so that they could adapt to the modern day lifestyles. The parents here are very conscious of the fact that their children need sporting activity for their all-round development, he says.





Baljit Kaur, hockey coach There is no dearth of sports talent in the city. A large number of them can be found in any sports ground or during the trials of any sports tournament here, she says. Be it easy jobs through sports or admissions through the sports quota seats, the considerations for the parents here vary for sending their wards into sports, she says. Parents from the city do not want their children to stick to books to become doctors or engineers, as they feel that mere studies are not going to help their children in any field of life. This is very encouraging. This attitude would surely help in making city youngsters good sportspersons. The games like kabaddi, which is getting cash prizes and recognition, is attracting children, she feels. The increasing competition has also made the sports field more vibrant in the city, where, she feels, the soul of sports lies. The children are coming to the city specially to take up games like hockey, she says. The city surely does have a sports culture and it shows.","['hockey', 'coach', 'kaur', 'chandigarh', 'wings', 'tribune', 'games', 'parents', 'india', 'city', 'feels', 'children', 'facilities']","Palwinder Kaur, kabaddi coach The sports centers, and the former sports wings in schools have served as fertile nursery for sports talent.

Philanthropy is hallmark of Sector 40 school

Arvind Kumar, Class VIII-F

Rohit Singh, Class VI-G





Sandeep, Class VI-A Chandigarh, November 12

Philanthropy has become the hallmark of Government High School, Sector 40, which is running a number of educational projects to benefit slum children with a special focus on the girl child. While the school caters to students staying in and around Sector 40 and nearby villages and colonies, it has gone out of the way to give back to society whether it is by way of ""Bori se Basta"" started in 1995 to educate rag-pickers from adjoining slums or the ""Chalo Beti School "" project aimed at imparting education to the girl child. These projects, along with Aasra, whereby students collected donations for the poor, were pioneered by Mr Bahadur Singh, Headmaster of the school for over 10 years when the school evolved into a centre for such activity and carved a niche for itself. Started as a primary school with 1,100 students in 1984, the school was upgraded to a middle school in April 1994. Next year, more classes were added and it acquired the status of high school, with 2200 students on roll. Computer education is given to students from Class VI onwards. With a campus not big enough to accommodate all classes, the school works in two shifts. Classes for the senior section are run in the mornings while students of Classes I to V attend school in the evening shift. A night school, started in 1999, is also run on the same premises and has 45 students. The school has an enthusiastic lot of students who participate in all activities ranging from painting and quiz to debates, declamations and sports. The school also boasts of students who have represented the city in the national games.



W ith 28 years of teaching experience behind him, the Headmaster of the school, Mr Nand Lal Chawla, is clear on how he has to run the school. Emphasising on discipline, he wants the school to strive for academic excellence as well after making a mark in other activities. * On what education means: Education does not necessarily restrict itself to books. Rather, wide in scope, it means developing the all-round personality of children. It also means that the schools have the additional responsibility of enabling a child to evolve as a better human being. * On the tuition menace in schools: There is a growing need to check tuitions, especially since these have become a status symbol for the well-to-do. Tuitions are taking a toll on the classroom culture and students are losing respect for their teachers. In my opinion, if students are attentive in class and go through their books regularly and thoroughly, there is absolutely no need to dole out money for these extra classes. * On the role of co-curricular activities: While academics are important given the present set-up, a student needs to be active as far as participation in co-curricular activities is concerned. We send teams for every contest and encourage participation of one and all. In sports, too, we partonise kho kho, volleyball and kabaddi. * On the future plans of the school: We want to organise programmes on de-addiction and educating slum children on the ill-effects of alcohol and cigarette on a large scale and on a regular basis to ensure that they give up their habit. Besides, the Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan is likely to get under way shortly.

Charu Singh

Tribune News Service New Delhi, April 11

Alcoholism is a disease that wastes itself out in numberless villages, small towns, cities and metropolises spread across the nation. While the alcoholics grapple with their addiction to liquor, their near and dear have to put up with the trauma of seeing their husband or son slowly degenerate due to the hold of alcohol. Statistics show that worldwide over two million people die each year due to alcoholism. Data collected by the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) in India shows that this problem is growing at the rate of 7 per cent each year. Also, the sale of the AA big book worldwide is massive. This year, it has entered into its 25th millionth copy, second only to the Bible. Alcoholics Anonymous in a rather quiet manner is doing sterling work to keep alcoholics sober. This organisation is a collective effort on the part of former alcoholics to help those suffering from alcoholism and bring them back on the straight and narrow road to sobriety. The main thrust of this organisation was beautifully explained by a former alcoholic at one of the AA meetings. Since anonymity is the rule at AA, he is called Mr X, Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of love, of genuine caring for each other. No lecturing happens here at all, we are all sick of lectures. What counts is that we share each others stories, each others lives, our happiness and our sorrow. This is what helps us re-build. Another alcoholic who has been sober for the past 14 years and now helps keep his more vulnerable companions sober says, I joined AA in January 83 and then I had not come here on my own but was brought here by my father as though it was my first day at school. There were four-five persons here in this room then and I sat down in a bemused state. I remember there was this American lady who was telling her story. She said that she was a housewife whose husband gave her money for groceries and she bought groceries with half the money and spent the rest on alcohol.  A miracle happened that day as I realised for the first time that honest people existed in this world. I was very impressed with this newfound honesty and started coming back to AA in the hope of finding more honest people and sharing with them. This put me firmly back on the path to recovery. Mr V, a serious alcoholic who literally walked back from the grave to a decent sober life, says, I started drinking at the age of 16, I then took my first drink out of a feeling of rebellion. In those days I had this sense of alienation from society and I drank out of a feeling of loneliness. When I had my first drink it acted like magic and removed all feelings of alienation. It removed all my problems. With the passage of time drinking became my main activity. Mr V further elaborated, Then accidents started occurring. I started missing college. My family did all sorts of things. They took me to doctors, pundits, tantrics, they got me married. Nothing worked, my drinking just went from bad to worse. I could not work and my health degenerated. My father in desperation took out a circular saying he would have nothing to do with me. I had hit rock bottom in those days. I wanted to stop but could not and became suicidal. Finally, one day when I was collecting trash to sell and buy booze I saw an Alcoholics Anonymous advertisement. I came to the meeting. V says that, It was the love and attention I received here that worked. It slowly gave me the confidence to rebuild my life and stay sober. I took my last drink on December 24, 92 and have stayed sober ever since. I came to the fellowship a wreck and a 100 per cent failure and today in recovery, I feel Im a 100 per cent success.","['sober', 'chandigarh', 'tribune', 'anonymous', 'india', 'took', 'mr', 'v', 'aa', 'started', 'love', 'fellowship', 'alcoholics']","Data collected by the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) in India shows that this problem is growing at the rate of 7 per cent each year.

Darkness to light As 200 members of Alcoholics Anonymous, who once couldnt be trusted to bring home the pay packets, are gearing up to hold a three-day convention at Patni Top from June 15, Saurabh Malik talks to their families in Chandigarh to find out how they have cured themselves of their spouses and parents alcoholic illness Rising from the grave of a dead family life, 15-year-old Dhruv (name changed to protect identity) is living again, lightheartedly. Until a few years ago, the burden of breathing was suffocating him. Looking for steady existence amidst the rubble of shattered whisky bottles and smashed family life, he would often struggle hard to stop the tears from flowing, along with alcohol  the invigorating elixir that was killing his father slowly and ruthlessly. ""My spirits would take a deep plunge every time dad raised a toast,"" he says in a surprisingly steady voice that comes from looking at things from a distance. ""Those were the days when I considered my dad a culprit. He would hit the bottle on one pretext or the other. And I, on my part, would strike back with a punch of callous words and obstinate behaviour."" Drowned childhood All this was eight years ago. Dhruv still recalls the time when he would argue with his father for hours and make him swear against drinking during the precious few hours he was sober. ""But then he would forget all about it and come back home after drowning all the pledges in liquor,"" he says. ""As he would scream and shout before fighting with my mother, I would sit huddled in a corner feeling cheated and betrayed"". How could his father swear upon him and forget all about it in a few gulps? The question would torture him for hours together and leave him embittered. After all, it is not easy for an eight-year old to reconcile with the fact that his father is lying to him especially when uncorrupted by the ways of the world he thinks truth to be the ultimate reality. In any case sulking did not help. To worsen things, his practising advocate father started losing clients. ""They would come to his office and leave without a word after finding him busy with the bottle instead of briefs,"" says Dhruv. ""It goes without saying that the distance between the two ends began to increase incessantly."" Helping hand It was then his mother came to know about Alcoholics Anonymous, Al-Anon family group and Alateen  organisations cooperating with each other for the welfare of the alcoholics and their families, including the children. Soon Dhruv decided to join Alateen and found himself sitting amidst strangers with familiar tales during the meetings. ""Initially, I found it impossible to open up. After all, even a kid is taught not to wash his dirty linen in public and use social organisations as clotheslines to hang the yarns. But then I started to loosen up. And realise I was not the only victim of alcoholism. There were so many like me trying hard to live again. And there were others who had overcome the problem and were helping strangers to lead a quality life."" In the meetings, Dhruv realised that his father is not a criminal, but a patient. A sick man in need of love and understanding! He also realised that the disease of excessive drinking, like diabetes, can only be controlled and not cured. And with the realization came the feeling of sympathetic love and compassion. ""For the first time in so many years I was purged of the hatred I had for my father. I realised that I had to focus on myself and my immediate surroundings. I just could not stand behind my dad with a stick in my angry hands, watching life slip by. If dad wanted to go in for a cure, the feeling had to come from within him. There was hardly anything I could do about it"". As he talks you realise alcohol, that has destroyed his father and family, has also made a man out of this teenager. The fizz of childhood may be missing in his life, but its still stable and rock steady. The fact that he scored 89 per cent in the Class X CBSE examinations is nothing but a testimony to this effect. ""My only regret is that dad kept on raising a toast but did not join me in the celebrations`85. But I am sure he will be there by my side when I achieve the next milestone`85,"" he says. As the meeting comes to an end, you realise that Dhruv has started to live again. Living life Right, along with Dhruv, Sneha and Poonam (names changed) are also living, but for others. Sneha only recently lost her spouse to alcohol. But Poonams husband has stopped hitting the bottle with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous. In any case, both are still the members of the Al-Anon family group. Today they tell the families of so many alcoholics not to contribute to the problem by taking over all the responsibilities. In fact, they ask the members to concentrate on themselves so that they can improve their lives. ""The families must realise that by taking care of themselves and their immediate surroundings, they are not acting selfish,"" asserts Sneha. Sounds sensible! All for one Just in case you know little about the Al-Anon family group, here is something about the organisation: The group is fellowship of relatives and friends of alcoholics sharing experience, strength and hope for solving their common problems. The group believes that alcoholism is a family illness. It has just one purpose: to help the families of the alcoholics. Alateen is a part of the Al-Anon fellowship designed for younger friends and relatives of alcoholics.","['chandigarh', 'alanon', 'tribune', 'group', 'realise', 'families', 'india', 'dad', 'family', 'dhruv', 'father', 'life', 'alcoholics']","""But then he would forget all about it and come back home after drowning all the pledges in liquor,"" he says.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,[],2012-04-05 00:00:00,"COMMUNITY Alcoholism playing havoc with families

Pradeep Sharma

Tribune News Service Chandigarh, April 4

The shocking incident of an alcoholic government official shooting at his 22-year-old daughter in Sector 41 here recently has once again brought under sharp focus the deadly disease of alcoholism, which is playing havoc with the lives of drunkards and their families. Families try all means to control the menace that has sunk deep into the fabric of their lives. An alcoholic does not listen to any counselling. An elder's comment is seen as unnecessary interference and wife's comments are dumped as emotional blackmailing. A retired colonel, wishing anonymity, said: ""The problem of alcoholism is very peculiar and the best treatment for chronic alcoholics does not lie in visits to doctors or even police stations as was very common. I saw the evil serpent of alcohol consume lives and destroy families during my career. In my own family, I saw my son sinking every day, into oblivion, because he was trapped in the dark alley of drinking."" Colonel Singh said: ""My son started drinking when he joined an engineering college in Nasik. He got a decent job in an MNC in Gurgaon and during his days there he entered a path of self-destruction. He lost his job and, in fact, lost himself as he would keep himself locked in his room and repeatedly ask for alcohol. He even got violent and at one point of time, I pushed him out of the house because he hit his mother."" ""Life became unbearable because his drinking sessions would start early mornings until I met a retired university professor with whom I shared my life. He goaded me into attending a session of the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Honestly speaking, I did not hope for anything there. I was forced to come for the second meeting and I saw a little hope when I heard some people share their personal experiences, on their return journey to normalcy. I made an attempt at getting my son who relented after persuasion of more than a month. He was still drinking even when he went to counselling because I would give him money when he came to attend a session. After about three months, one evening when I took out a Rs 100 note to give him he said: ""Papa, I don't want to drink."" I kept looking at him. He started crying and gave me a bear hug. This was three years ago. He has not drunk till date. He has joined an office at the IT Park. His job is not as big as it was at the MNC, however, he says he has made a beginning and will find his way. Even as different sections of society, including policy makers, the police and NGOs debate ways and means to control the menace of drinking, help is at hands in the shape of the Alcoholics Anonymous(AA), a fellowship of recovered men and women, who share their experience, strength and hope with one another that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism. Recovery from alcoholism, once nearly impossible, is now routine provided the problem drinker follows a simple spiritual programme suggested by the AA. The recovery programme of the Alcoholic Anonymous works on simple 12 steps of which attending meetings, which are held in different parts of the tricity everyday, formed an integral part. The alcoholic is not a bad man but a diseased man and like diabetes the disease can be arrested one day at a time. In fact, alcoholics have an allergy of the body, the overpowering craving for alcohol once some has been introduced to their body. Even the World Health Organisation, American Medical Association and the British Medical Association have accepted alcoholism as a progressive, fatal disease which has not cure till date, but can be arrested on a one day at a time basis. The only requirement for AA membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no dues or fees for gaining the AA membership. The AA is self-supporting through our own contributions. The AA is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organisation or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy; and neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety, a member said. Though the AA has no opinion on any outside issue and does not wish to engage in any controversy yet we collaborate with the government and NGO to check the menace of alcoholism in society, another member of the AA said. Are you a problem drinker? Have you ever decided to stop drinking for a week or so, but the resolve lasted only for a couple of days? Do you wish people would mind their own business about your drinking -- stop telling you what to do? Have you ever switched from one kind of drink to another in the hope that this would keep you from getting drunk? Have you had to have an eye-opener upon awakening during the past year?

Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee president Paramjit Singh Sarna who visited the Guru Tegh Bahadur memorial twice with Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit to monitor the preparations was not even offered a seat on the dais by the organisers. Along with the Chief Minister and AICC general secretary Rahul Gandhi, the dais was captured by the officials of Delhi Tourism. This surprised the Sikhs present at the function as the DSGMC president represents 15 lakh people of the community in Delhi. He had installed hoardings at various places giving an impression that the memorial function of Guru Tegh Bahadur was organised by the gurdwara committee. Sikhs present at the function wished to have a glimpse of their committee leader seated on the dais, but they were disappointed. Paying lip service While the CPI activists in a rally held recently chanted slogans ""Dilli sarkar murdabad"", passers-by said in a low voice, ""party ko paise do, paise do"". They laughed at the rally saying that it had become a ritual of the political parties to take out rally once or twice a year, showing their presence to the government and others in power. They collect finance from their loyal workers by organising rallies and dharnas. Even the police personnel who were escorting the rally said this was all drama. The political parties take out rallies during elections, parliamentary sessions and other such occasions. They are not serious about taking up the issues of the people and only pay lip service. They show their strength to the government by organising rallies and dharnas. Mosquito rules the roost With the rains back to the Capital over the last week, major universities providing on campus accommodation are worried about the increasing mosquito bites that the students have been reporting. Most colleges are taking all the measures possible to avoid any dengue case. Be it JNU, DU or Jamia, all major universities are struggling hard to avoid an outbreak. Meanwhile, students have a fan page on Facebook, flaunting pictures of their mosquito bites. ""These aren't mosquitoes. They appear to be something else. They leave freakish marks on the body, which are very hard to get rid of. We thought of having some fun out of the situation, and hence started this page on Facebook. We already have more then 4,000 members,"" said Suman Verma, one of the residents at JNU. Missing children In sync with the common trend, the Delhi police seems to be following different yardsticks for the rich and the poor when it comes to acting upon cases related to missing children. The panelists of a public hearing pertaining to the issues surrounding ""missing children"" almost remained silent when the parents of such kids expressed wide dissent against the Delhi police's apathy towards the poor. When complaints against the police poured in, additional commissioner of special protection unit for women and children K Choudhary, having little to defend his force, assured the complainants that the guilty would be punished. Then came strong words from the member of the National Advisory Council, Harsh Mander, who said that all the instances highlighted here show a dereliction of duty and lack of accountability on the part of the police.

Aditi Tandon

Tribune News Service Chandigarh, November 13

Dr Elaine McDowell has long been Americas answer to the menacing alcoholism and drug problem. Ever a trailblazer, this first woman and the first-ever African-American woman to chair the Alcoholics Anonymous worldwide, with over 28 years of experience in administering, treatment, research and prevention programmes in the alcohol, drug abuse and mental health fields, still views her achievements as meagre. For the world outside, however, the strategies she developed for prevention of alcoholism during her tenure as Deputy Director, the National Institute of Drug Abuse and acting Administrator of Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration in the US Federal Service, are most significant for the positive impact they generated among the afflicted and the affected. Arriving in Chandigarh to chair the 32nd National General Service Conference of AA opening tomorrow, Dr McDowell, twice the recipient of the Presidential citation (from George Bush and Bill Clinton) for her expertise in tackling alcohol and drug problems in America, Canada and Africa, described alcoholism as a family disease. Surveys confirm that against every suffering alcoholic, five people known to him are affected. The number of people suffering indirectly could thus be staggering because one out of every 10 drinkers in the world is an alcoholic. In the given scenario, where alcoholism continues to be a major public health enigma throughout the world, Dr McDowell begins by stressing the need to understand the factors that perpetuate the problem. Genetic factors are extremely critical. A person born with these is at higher risk to be an alcoholic than others in the population. Along with psychological factors like depression and social factors like meagre income, genetic factors can accentuate the problem tremendously. The primary solution lies in identifying high risk groups and helping them accept that they need solutions which are offered heartily at AA. Significantly, 140 million alcoholics still walk the earth, but AA knows of only 2.4 million. Assessing the situation vis-a-vis India, Dr McDowell, said, During my nine years of association with AA as its nonalcoholic trustee, I have developed faith in its power to cure the world. The Fellowships greatest strength is its singleness of purpose. That explains its growth in India. Where in the first 44 years of its inception since 1958, it could motivate about 400 members, in the recent past it has added 25,000 members working in 700 groups. People are reaching out we, at AA, dont preach. We only share. Its through the power of sharing that AA has managed 50 per cent success rate in relapse prevention. Having devised successful programmes for children of alcoholics and drug abusers, besides establishing national substance-abuse treatment and prevention programmes for pregnant and parenting women and their infants, back home in the USA, Dr McDowell advocates the need to develop culturally-sensitive strategies that can be replicated across the world, with minor adaptations. Also the former leader of the international team on substance (alcohol or drug) abuse prevention training to 22 nations at regional sites in sub-Saharan Africa, Dr McDowell stresses the need to design a curriculum that naturally inspires young minds towards sobriety. The American educational institutions have incorporated factors of alcoholism and drug abuse in curricula. India can do the same, so that children grow with risk factors and their consequences on their tips. Looking forward to collective healing through AA, she added, AA is a fellowship which men, women, youth, with all their insecurities, can join with an assurance of support. Let them remember that this is the movement which brought recovery to countless alcoholics across the globe.







Kicking the bottle

Yoginder Gupta

Tribune News Service Chandigarh, November 13

Avinash (not his real name), a well-dressed progressive farmer of Haryana, confidently walked to the podium and declared that he was an alcoholic till two years ago. He had been drinking for 25 years. Alcohol was his best friend, better than his job, his family and everyone else. I needed alcohol to wake up. With two pegs inside me, I could think better or so I thought. I continued to drink even when doctors diagnosed me as suffering from acute jaundice. Sometimes I broke bottles, to lift them again the next day. My relationship with God was that of contempt. I considered myself to be God. Then I heard about Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and attended one of its meetings. Till then I used to think I would not be able to quit drinks and, moreover, what I would do without alcohol as life was empty without it. At AA I was surprised when I saw people laughing and happy at 8 p.m., that too without drinking. Life changed after that. My obsession with alcohol is gone. Now I try to find my humble place in Gods scheme of things. Ms Jaya (identity changed) had no hesitation in admitting that till she joined AA, she thought anger and irritable behaviour were the gifts of alcoholism. But now she had learnt that alcoholism was a disease and she was not its cause. She had also learnt how to deal with a patient suffering from alcoholism. Ms Rachna (not real name) said she was a child of a disfunctional family as her father was an alcoholic. Arguments between her father and mother were a routine. Being the eldest child, she was the worst affected. Though she loved both her parents, she would be accused of being partisan by each. Relatives used to make fun of her by referring to her fathers alcoholism. She became a recluse. She saw a ray of hope in AA. She learnt how to live her own life. People were the same but I changed. My relations with them improved and I no longer feel dejected. Lalit (identity changed) said when he was an alcoholic, there was prohibition in Mumbai and Mr Morarji Desai was the Chief Minister. Sitting in a drinking joint in the evening, we used to dismiss the Chief Minister as if we were the Governor. All of them were either members of AA or their family members. They were sharing their experiences with the Haryana Governor, Babu Parmanand, at Raj Bhawan this evening. Babu Parmanand had invited them for tea along with Ms Elian McDowell, Chairperson, AA World; and Mr Greg M., General Manager of AA World Service, New York.

Rajendra P Jindal

TWO different news, apparently unrelated, made it to the newspapers a fortnight or so back. The first of these appeared, possibly, in The Tribune, with the headline “81 lakh lesser tobacco consumers since 2010”. The other news item appeared the very next day, and was titled ""Punjab Inspector held for drug trafficking"" The same evening, it was prominently splashed on all television channels. It continued to be followed in the media for the next couple of days until it was drowned by similar news.

An ordinary reader may be excused for not seeing any relation between these two. But let us take them one by one. It may be news to most readers that tobacco (nicotine) is a drug too, albeit a legal one, in all the senses of the word that “drug” conveys. Until a few years ago, rich and powerful tobacco companies in the US, most of the medical researchers and doctors (the latter too on the payroll of tobacco companies) refused to admit that tobacco is a drug. It was contended that it is, at worst, a habit-forming substance only.

With the help of PET and MRI scans, it has been conclusively proved that nicotine creates the same biochemical and molecular effects in the brain as any other drug such as cocaine and heroin and many other activities such as a kiss, a hug or a word of praise. This effect is known as elevation of a neurotransmitter substance (a chemical which carries messages from one micro part of the brain to the other) called “Dopamine”. The surge in the level of Dopamine produces a feeling of pleasure, at least initially.

This effect is not common to the same degree in everybody; probably it is modified by a genetic factor. Therefore, whereas some people can ""take it and leave it"", others become addicted. Smoking or chewing tobacco is as addictive as any other drug and as difficult to get rid of. It gives the same sense of pleasure and the physical ill-effects are much more than any other drug. No other drug causes fatal cancers, heart and chest problems and many serious ailments.

The interesting question that arises is: how were 81 lakh people able to give it up without even a single one ever being arrested or put into jail? No amount of tobacco was confiscated and no police officer or politician was ever accused of dealing with tobacco. One reason is that unlike other drugs, tobacco was never prohibited. Secondly, it is the education by various means and at various fora about the ill-effects of tobacco that has worked the miracle. In school and college textbooks, on radio and television as well as cigarette advertisement boards and even cigarette packets, ill-effects of smoking are prominently displayed. Most people seem to know that smoking causes the cancer of the lungs, even if they know nothing else. Therefore, compared to many more than those who have given up smoking are those who want to and are trying to give up smoking.

As far as the other news that a Punjab Police Sub-inspector was held for drug trafficking, nobody should have trouble believing that the episode is only the tip of the iceberg. A junior police officer cannot run a drug empire without the collusion of colleagues and seniors. In the run-up to the Punjab Assembly elections, the chiefs of at least two of the political parties declared that they will totally abolish the drug menace from Punjab within a month of coming to power. The one who is now the Chief Minister, sotto voce, scaled the peak of rhetoric and ignorance when he declared that “the back of the drug trade has been broken”. As the subsequent events, including the news in discussion have revealed, the demon called drug trade is healthy and well, thank you. Are these leaders innocent, ignorant, naive or plain simpletons? The drug trade will persist as long as our approach to handling it remains archaic.

For some unknown reason, in contrast to smoking and consumption of alcohol, consuming drugs has always been considered a character flaw, a criminal activity. The dopamine hypothesis has proved that drug addiction is a disorder of the brain no different from that caused by nicotine and alcohol. It is a mental illness of similar nature. The right place for a drug addict, therefore, is a hospital and not a prison and the way to deal with drugs is not to prohibit them but to legalise them just as it is in the case of tobacco and alcohol. Why are we so keen and insistent on prohibiting drugs and not tobacco and alcohol, while the latter two are more harmful? It obviously cannot be because we are a nation with knee-jerk puritanism. In that case, we would prohibit alcohol also. There are two reasons for the insistence on drug prohibition. The drug trade will exist as long as there is prohibition that generates exorbitant profits for the drug lords like our Sub-inspector and his seniors as well as politicians. Also, we inherently want to punish narco-trafficking, not eradicate it.

However, the most novel reason for drug prohibition so far has been propounded by the American author Barbara Ehrenreich. She feels that we cling to prohibition for the same reason one clings to so many other self -destructive habits like nicotine, cocaine and heroin: because of the way it makes us feel — good and self righteous. If we surrender now, it will send the wrong message. Says she, “Legal drugs, even if heavily taxed and extensively regulated would no doubt be cheaper than illegal ones. This could mean more people sampling them out of curiosity. This danger has to be weighed against the insidious marketing dynamics of illegal drugs whose widely inflated prices compel the user to become a pusher and a recruiter of new users”.

It is time to try a new approach to the drug problem. The people who want to use drugs know where to get them and no law has yet dissuaded people from using them. Legalise, regulate and tax drugs to the hilt. Take the money that would have gone towards preventive laws and spend it on education, healthcare and rehabilitation.

A word about rehabilitation too. Dopamine-related research has shown that abstinence, if maintained, not only halts the physical and psychological damage wrought by drugs but also reverses it in large measure. A majority of the rehabilitation centres, mushrooming all over and uniformly lacking sufficient staff with enough expertise (psychiatrists and psychotherapists) and dedication (nurses and helpers), are worse than prisons. An addict needs long treatment, perhaps running into months. During this period, there are failures but their rate is no different from that for other chronic diseases. Nearly half the recovering addicts fail to maintain complete abstinence after a year, about the same proportion of patients with diabetes and hypertension who fail to comply with their medication regimens. Therefore, occasional relapse only means that more treatment is required, not that the addict be imprisoned. Alcoholic Anonymous and Narcotic Anonymous are the two organisations which probably have the highest cure rate because their members never refer to themselves as “cured”; they always call themselves “recovering addicts”. We could begin with a drug like marijuana and see how abolishing prohibition works. Then, we could move on to more drugs. Doesn't it sound like an idea that might catch on?

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,[],2011-11-25 00:00:00,"An ex-judge, housewife, hardcore politician main contestants

Raman Mohan/TNS Hisar, November 24

For the first time in 43 years, the Adampur Assembly constituency is witnessing an electoral contest in which the three main contestants come from different backgrounds. While Congress nominee Kulbir Beniwal is a politician having represented the erstwhile Bhattu Kalan constituency for about four years from 2005, HJC-BJP candidate Renuka Bishnoi is a housewife. INLD nominee Ram Singh Baswana is a former judge. Uptill now, the Bhajan Lal clan, which has managed to keep this constituency within the family fold for 43 years, had faced challenges from politicians only. Renuka is trying to retain the seat for the Bishnoi family vacated by her husband, Kuldeep Bishnoi, after winning the recent byelection to the Hisar Lok Sabha seat. Even though this is her maiden electoral contest, she understands the intricacies of an election fully. Our entire family is well entrenched in politics. I have learnt that politics is simply a way to serve our people. So anyone who wants to serve the people should be in politics and being a woman or a housewife is no bar to it, she says. To INLD nominee Ram Singh Baswana, having remained a judge is an advantage. Having dispensed justice to the people during my service period only makes my resolve to undo injustice done to the people of Adampur stronger, he says. His entire campaign is based on the theme of justice for the people. He says: Even after 64 years of Independence the number of BPL families has risen to 50 per cent of the population. The Congress has ruled the country for 52 years but it forgets all about the poor and the needy after it is voted to power. This is the biggest injustice . Congress nominee Kulbir Beniwal was at one time a protégé of the late Bhajan Lal. He has since drifted away from the Bishnois. However, it is more of a contest between the parties than the candidates. The HJC wants a win both to reinforce the impression that along with the BJP it will provide a credible alternative to the people in the next assembly poll and to keep the seat within the family fold. The INLD, on the other hand, is determined to further its recent performance in this assembly segment when the party bagged over 28,000 votes here during the Hisar Lok Sabha byelection. Former Chief Minister Om Parkash Chautala has toured the area extensively. INLD Secretary-General Ajay Singh Chautala is leading his partys campaign. The Congress has roped in every senior party leader for the campaign. The party has established three different teams for campaigning that are sparing no effort to reinforce its position in the assembly segment. It had suffered huge losses in this segment in the recent Hisar Lok Sabha byelection. The party managed to poll just 15,000 votes as against 42,000 polled in the 2009 Assembly elections. Under the circumstances, the candidates themselves have been relegated to the background. No wonder unseemly oral duels between senior party leaders have become the main highlight of the campaign. The Chautalas are alleging that the Bishnois and the Congress have made an unholy alliance and are trying to fix the election like a cricket match. They also allege that the Bhajan Lal family has always exploited the people of the area by playing the caste card, thereby vitiating the political atmosphere in the area. The Bishnois, on the other hand, maintain that the Chautalas have never been able to defeat any member of their family in any constituency in which they faced each other, including Bhiwani, Adampur and Hisar. The Congress is assuring the voters that that if the party nominee wins, Adampur will see unprecedented development. The Congress is currently engaged in winning over those families which had voted for the party in 2009 but have since crossed over to opposite camps. The campaign is led by Randeep Singh Surjewala, Dharambir Singh and Sampat Singh.","['constituency', 'hisar', 'chandigarh', 'tribune', 'nominee', 'india', 'party', 'family', 'assembly', 'congress', 'campaign', 'inld', 'singh']","While Congress nominee Kulbir Beniwal is a politician having represented the erstwhile Bhattu Kalan constituency for about four years from 2005, HJC-BJP candidate Renuka Bishnoi is a housewife.

The Tribune...Saturday Plus Head,,[],None,"Wasted lives

Addiction to medicinal drugs has reached alarming proportions in the region. The worst hit are our young adults. Social action on a war-footing is required to save them from ruin, says Jaya Bhardwaj T here is an air of adventure associated with it but it is a road that always leads nowhere except self-annihilation. Though its destructive potential is well documented, both in terms of scientific data and case studies, and the society and health organisations have been extremely concerned about its harrowing aftermath, substance abuse (drug addiction) continues to rise at an alarming rate. What is particularly unsettling is that it is the young who are the worst affected, and despite much publicity about the ill- effects of drug abuse, there seems to be no let- up in the rapidly rising graph of new addicts. Substance-addiction has, like in the West, led to the development of another social ill  crime. Sometime back a small group of drug addicts, THAT used to indulge in petty crimes to pay for their habit, tried to sabotage the whole power system of Haryana by removing fish plates and nuts and bolts from the 11,000 volts main tower line. In another incident, a drug addict of Mohali stabbed his sister- in- law when she refused to give him money for buying drugs. According to Dr Anil Malhotra, head of the drug de-addiction centre, PGI, Chandigarh, a drug abuser can engage in crimes of any dimension, ranging from brawls, rash driving and petty thefts to drug trafficking, without thinking of the consequences. Interestingly, the adult population of the city is more prone to liquor and tobacco abuse while the younger generation has found its nirvana in drugs. The drug menace is not confined to the poor and the uneducated sections of the young population which do not have the funds to buy expensive liquor. It has spread its tentacles to the affluent and the educated sections too. According to volunteers working against this menace, youngsters are more prone to medicinal drugs. Empty bottles of cough syrups can be found frequently in the lavatories and corners of schools and colleges of the City Beautiful. Chronic medicinal drug abusers also start injecting themselves with pain-killers and sedatives. The extent of drug addiction in the region is alarming. The number of patients in the drug de-addiction centre of the PGI, Chandigarh, is increasing every year. As many as 416 new patients have been brought to this centre this year as against 363 last year. Among them, 15 per cent are opium and heroin addicts, 4 per cent are habituated to cannabis, 26 per cent are intravenous injection users and 11 per cent have indulged in multiple drug abuse. About 44 per cent of the patients are suffering from alcohol abuse. The number of alcoholics has come down considerably since most of them are turning to substance abuse. As such, the number of patients taking intravenous drugs is rising at an alarming rate. The shift is because of the lower cost of narcotics. It would be pertinent to mention here that in 1988-89 only 3 per cent of the addicts were using intravenous drugs. However, it has now risen up to 26 per cent. On the other hand, 8 per cent of the patients admitted this year were found to be heroin addicts, down from 26 per cent in 1988-89. This is because of the high cost of heroin in the black market. One gram of heroin costs Rs 250 to 300 whereas an injection costs less than Rs 10. What is causing concern to doctors and volunteers is that a large number of patients do not seek treatment. They are wary of disclosing their identity and do not want to approach de-addiction centres of treatment. But, on the other hand, the telephone numbers of the counselling centre are inundated with calls asking for help and treatment via the telephone only. Though commendable work is being done by bodies like the Alcoholic Anonymous and Narcotic Anonymous to help drug abusers, only the tip of the iceberg has been reached so far. A random survey in and around Chandigarh shows that the number of addicts is increasing by the day, and the efforts to curb the menace are niggardly. It is not only the boys who are falling prey to drug abuse. More and more girls are also getting attracted towards it. However, because of social reasons, parents hide the addiction more in the case of girls than boys. The drug de-addiction centre at the PGI received only three to four girls for treatment in the last five years. A study of some of the cases shows that those who served as peddlers ultimately got involved in the use of drugs. Initially, it was the hefty commission which lured them into supplying drugs to the addicts. The rate of commission for peddling is between 25 and 40 per cent of the street price. Addiction happens accidentally also, says Dr Malhotra. He recalls the case of a patient from Gurdaspur who went to his doctor for the treatment of some ailment and the doctor injected him with a pain-killer. The man felt a ""heavenly pleasure"" and soon became a drug abuser. The incidence of medicinal drugs abuse is more amongst students as most syrups have no smell, and after taking it one goes to sleep because of its sedative effect. Cough syrups used by abusers contain codeine phosphate, one of the derivatives of opiates. Every 5 ml of these syrups contains 10 mg of codeine phosphate. A 100 ml bottle of the syrup costs about Rs 26 only. Similarly, the salt buprenorphine is also a derivatives of opiates. However ,the salt disulfiram is an alcohol- sensitised drug. The beginners start with consuming a bottle everyday but they soon graduate to four or five bottles a day. There are no recent studies in the field of drug abuse. The studies conducted in the 70s and the 80s indicate that the drug abusers are mainly males, and an appreciable number of them are students . According to them, 10 per cent to 40 per cent of the population generally indulges in alcohol abuse. For other drug abuse, the percentage varies from 0.475 to 54 per cent. Furthermore, in students, the males outnumbered the females and the commonly abused substances included tobacco, alcohol, sedative  hypnotics of various kinds and amphetamines. The incidence ranged from 20 to 70 per cent. It is evident from these studies that besides the use of traditional substances, i.e. intoxicants originating from cannabis (bhang, charas, ganja etc ) and opium (afeem), in rural area, new drugs like heroin and benzodiazepines are being frequently abused by vulnerable groups, especially the non student youth, industrial workers and slum dwellers. Experts are of the view that the menace can be controlled effectively only through choking the supply. Effective policing against drug trafficking is, therefore, the answer. In Chandigarh, 16 cases of drug trafficking were registered in 1997. Eight cases have been registered in the current year. Besides, there were two major recoveries in 1997 which indicate the magnitude of abuse in the area. The police recovered more than 9 kg of smack in two different cases. In addition, large quantities of poppy husk, opium and charas were also recovered. According to DSP Subhash Chander Sagar and Inspector Jagbir Singh, who have been actively involved in anti-smuggling operations, a large number of students are indulging in the abuse of medicinal drugs. The police, they say, feels helpless because as per the Indian Drugs and Cosmetics Act selling of these drugs is a non-cognizable offence. However, certain drugs have been covered under the Essential Commodities Act. The law needs to be amended further to stop the use of medicinal drugs and the selling of the medicines containing prohibited salts should be made cognisable in the Drugs Act itself, Sagar said. Moreover, the stocks of chemists should be regularly monitored so that they cannot indulge in trafficking .","['tribunesaturday', 'heroin', 'drugs', 'addicts', 'head', 'cent', 'drug', 'number', 'abuse', 'treatment', 'plus', 'medicinal', 'patients']","Wasted livesAddiction to medicinal drugs has reached alarming proportions in the region.

Smriti Sharma

Tribune News Service Chandigarh, June 10

Students seeking admission to the University Business School, Panjab University, stand to lose out on lakhs of rupees due to the uncoordinated admission process. Lack of coordination among the different quarters of the university is likely to delay the admission process. The first big question that has been baffling the officials is the definition of NRI. It is pertinent to mention here that The Tribune had reported about the matter and the university had then sought legal opinion. The legal retainer, Anupam Gupta, in his nine-page opinion had suggested to study each case individually. Further, he had maintained that a standing committee should be assigned the task to determine the NRI status in each individual case and should not be left to the whims of individuals in each department. The vice-chancellor had constituted a standing committee under the chairmanship of the DUI, S.K. Kulkarni, to determine the status of NRI students and to work out certain parameters for the same. But with the DUI on leave for a fortnight, the committee has not been able to meet and decide about the same leaving the fate of NRI students hanging in balance. There are 19 NRI seats in the UBS and nine in PUBS, Ludhiana. Not only this, the university authorities were supposed to decide upon eight seats under the sports quota for which 64 candidates applications were to be scrutinised and the list of eligible candidates was to come from the office of the deputy director of sports. The UBS sent its first letter to the directorate of sports in April this year and even after repeated reminders, the list hasnt reached the department adding to the delay. Also, the candidature of those under the freedom fighter and Kahsmiri migrants categories is yet to come. Even after that happens, three seats, one each for single girl child, cancer patient and AIDS patient, would still be left undecided for which the clearance is awaited from the university authorities. So far, the UBS has only been able to complete group discussions and personal interviews of 1,029 students in the general and SC/ST categories. The department is under immense pressure to declare the results of the general category as in the next two weeks, around three B-Schools are starting with their last lap of the admission process and in order to save one academic year, the students will be forced to choose these colleges over the UBS. Chairman of the department Dinesh Gupta said, The moment we receive the results/clearances by the coordinators of various categories, we will display it on the web and notice boards. There is no delay on our part. Vice-chancellor Prof R.C. Sobti said, All lists will be sent to the UBS within a day or two without any further delay, he assured.

PU sells prospectus sans application form

Tribune News Service Chandigarh, June 10

Buying a prospectus from Panjab University turned out to be a nightmarish experience for a student today when she found that the prospectus that she bought for Rs 1,100 didnt have the admission form in it. Indu Sharma, a Dera Bassi resident, went to the university to buy prospectus for BEd (correspondence course). After making a payment of Rs 1,100 at the bank counter, she opened the booklet and found the admission form missing. She went back to the counter and asked the official on the counter about the same. Instead of listening to her compliant, the official yelled at her and told her that she should have checked the prospectus at the time of purchasing and refused to give her another prospectus. At this, the girl started crying and people gathered there. Immediately the advisor (examinations), A.K. Bhandari, and dean, students welfare, Naval Kishore, rushed to the rescue of the girl. On the orders of the vice-chancellor, Naval Kishore bought the girl another prospectus and sorted out the matter.

Police remand for Bright

Tribune News Service Chandigarh, June 10

Chief judicial magistrate Kanchan Mahi today remanded Nigerian national Bright, accused of duping several persons through a million-pound Internet lottery scam, in two-day police custody. According to sources, senior police officials will interrogate the foreign national. Balbir Singh, an MBA student of Phase 3B-I, Mohali, had lodged a complaint with the UT police on June 4 alleging that he had been defrauded of Rs 1.81 lakh by representatives of UK-based company United Kingdom Online Promos on the pretext that he had won a £ 1 million lottery. Balbir told the police that he received an email from drawnoticetiws@dodo.com.au <mailto:drawnoticetiws@dodo.com.au> on May 11 informing him that he had won an award of £ 1 million during a draw held on May 9. He replied the mail and was told to pay Rs 1.81 lakh in four installments on one pretext or another. To catch the suspect red-handed, the police asked Balbir to call the companys representative to Chandigarh to collect the money. The plan succeeded and Bright walked right into the police trap. Acquitted Additional district and sessions judge Ravi Kumar Sondhi today acquitted Ranjit Singh of attempted murder charge after witnesses turned hostile.

ADMINISTRATION Rules for mobile tower installation notified

Tribune News Service Chandigarh, June 10

The Chandigarh administration has the paved way for installation of mobile towers on non-residential buildings owned by it, semi-government organisations and autonomous bodies. Notifying the rules, the administration has said the towers will be shared by at least three mobile companies and the cellular operator will have to put up monopole towers on the institutional premises. The operators will have to obtain separate permission from the administration after obtaining the consent of the company that is erecting the tower on terms and conditions to be decided on case-to-case basis. The total height of the pole from ground zero will not exceed 30 metres and for towers on the rooftop of the building, the height of the building shall be reduced by permissible 30 metres. The size of the generator room will be 11.49x7.06 metres, including the area of pole and shelter room and its components. The generator will have to be noiseless and conform to environmental laws and guidelines. The final permission to install the towers will be granted by the single window committee. After approval from the committee, the application will be sent to the plan approval committee for issuance of formal orders and the rent deed will be signed with the UT administration for a period of five years. The deed can be subsequently extended in future for three years each on such terms and conditions that will be decided by the administration at the time of every renewal. The site will be used only for setting up towers and generator room. No commercial activity will be permitted. If the company that has put up the tower fails to pay the lease money to the administration within 15 days from the expiry of the due date, the administration will be free to disconnect the essential services to the tower and remove it without giving any prior notice.

Was declared failed in wrong subject

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 12

A suicide bid is what it took Akashdeep Kaur to clear her BA (I) examination. She would have cleared her exam a year ago, but for the blunder of Panjab University.

The indifferent attitude of the university authorities to correct its mistake left the girl so helpless that today she reached the roof of administration block, along with a suicide note.

According to Kuljit Nagra, former Senator, the university officials kept calling the girl to assure her that things would be rectified soon.

Her parents said: Since she was under depression and was not happy, we were worried. She left home this morning without informing anyone and when we tried to call her, she said she would either get her results today or end her life. We reached the university and found her on staircase. She was carrying a note addressed to her mother.

The trial of Akashdeep from Bassi Pathana, a student of Government College-46, started in April last when the university declared her failed in the examination.

When she applied for re-evaluation, she was declared a compartment case and asked to re-appear in public administration examination.

Akash Deep re-appeared for the examination and cleared it, but was shocked when she went to collect her result. The authorities in the university told her that she was supposed to take re-appear examination in some other subject.

When she went to collect her result, she was told that she had got compartment in political science and by mistake university authorities told her to re-appear for public administration examination. She was forced by the university not to tell this to anyone. When we came to know about the case, we submitted a representation to the university last year, but nothing was done, said Nagra.

The incident has raised several questions on the universitys tall claims of transparent examination system.","['university', 'told', 'chandigarh', 'girl', 'tribune', 'india', 'declared', 'suicide', 'went', 'authorities', 'administration', 'reappear', 'examination']","The indifferent attitude of the university authorities to correct its mistake left the girl so helpless that today she reached the roof of administration block, along with a suicide note.

Geetanjali Gayatri

Tribune News Service Chandigarh, May 25

The BJP today took the lead and released its manifesto to seven newly constituted Municipal Corporations which go to the polls on June 2. The Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), also fighting the election on its party symbol, is likely to do so in a couple of days. BJP state chief Ram Bilas Sharma, releasing the manifesto, promised relief from house tax to those with houses on 150 sq yd plots, single-window system for certificates issued by the corporation and relief from water tax among other things. We are committed to providing corruption-free working in MCs and the sorry state of affairs in Haryana under the Congress rule will be reflected in the results of these elections. The state is grappling with corruption, crime against women and atrocities on the Dalits and the public is fed up, Sharma said. The manifesto promises clean drinking water, public libraries for senior citizens, better parking facilities, sanitation and installation of CCTV cameras at strategic locations. While this manifesto has been released for all seven MCs put together, BJP leaders, in all the seven MCs of Panchkula, Ambala, Yamunanagar, Karnal, Panipat, Rohtak and Hisar, released separate manifestoes highlighting the local issues which will be addressed if the BJP comes to power in the MCs. Sharma added that the party was fielding candidates in 121 wards and supporting four others while the other seats have been left open for its alliance partner, the Haryana Janhit Congress. They are free to contest these seats though the leadership of the HJC has already decided against contesting the MC elections on the party symbol. The Congress, without officially contesting on the party symbol, is going all out to show its strength, Sharma claimed. Promises better water supply, sewerage system Karnal: The BJP, contesting the Municipal Corporation elections on party symbol, has promised corruption-free governance and single-window system for civic facilities, including approval of building maps and implementation of citizen charter. Releasing the manifesto for the MC poll, party leaders said the drinking water supply would be regularised in all areas, sewerage system extended to all colonies and parking problems and strengthening of fire brigade would be given priority. CCTV cameras would be installed at all crossings and other locations and maintenance of civic services would be entrusted to ""Resident Welfare Committees"" and the corporation would fund these committees. Karnal BJP president Askok Sukheja said a four-storey building would be allowed in all areas, including the HUDA sectors, a master plan would be prepared for constructing cheaper houses for the poor and all building constructed on 150 Sq Yard plots would be exempted from house tax. The manifesto also promised construction of flyovers within the city to decongest traffic, installation of water treatment plant and streamlining of civic services. Sankalp Patra out Hisar: BJPs national spokesperson Captain Abhimanyu today reiterated that his partys alliance with the HJC was strong and intact. Abhimanyu was here to release the election manifesto of the party for the June 2 MC poll. He said the recent visits of senior BJP leaders to enquire INLD Supremo Om Prakash Chautalas well being were social meetings and people should not see any politics behind these meetings. Terming the forthcoming MC poll as important for the states politics, the BJP spokesperson said the results of these poll would have a bearing on the coming parliamentary and assembly elections. Releasing the partys manifesto, Abhimanyu said the party had given it the name of Sankalp Patra. He said after winning the poll, party candidates would be committed to ensuring sanitation, supply of pure drinking water, sewers and other basic amenities to residents. Abhimanyu said before coming to power, the Congress had promised to waive House Tax in Haryana. Slip-up on water tax The seriousness with which the BJP is contesting the MC elections today stood exposed when Ram Bilas Sharma committed a faux pas, promising a rollback on water tax which does not exist in Haryana. In a press conference, he said, ""If elected, we will ensure that water tax goes"", though the manifesto made no mention of this. ""Ill-briefed and ill-prepared for the conference, Sharma, when asked, was clueless that Haryana had no water tax. However, BJP leaders attributed it to a slip-up while Sharma maintained that he ""meant waiver on water bills for slums"".

Geetanjali Gayatri

Tribune News Service Chandigarh, January 11

The written word carries weight and Congress men in Haryana seem to have discovered its benefits recently. Thats probably why the second term of the Congress rule in Haryana has ushered in a new trend in communication-letters. The issue of lop-sided development seems to have been carried forward from the governments previous term with the states Finance Minister Capt Ajay Singh Yadav and former Minister and MLA of Tosham Kiran Choudhry upset over the poor cousin tag for their constituencies and districts. After expressing his reservation on the land acquisition move in Rewari and backing the cause of the aggrieved farmers in a letter to Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda a fortnight back, Yadav is learnt to have sent yet another letter to the CM-this time for a university in his home district. Unhappy with the inequitable distribution of universities in Haryana over the past many years, sources said this second missive has dwelt at length on the need for a university in Rewari, a demand raised at a rally addressed by Hooda in the district in the recent past. Stating that the existing post-graduate regional centre in the district should be upgraded to a university, sources said Yadav had listed the concentration of universities in a few districts, with particular emphasis on Rohtak, Jhajjar and Sonepat. Mentioning that Rohtak had two universities and the prestigious IIM was also coming up there, the letter says Sonepat and Jhajjar had been lucky in getting an education city, two universities and an AIIMS institute. It goes on to state that the central university at Mahendragarh was at the far end of the district and would serve little purpose. Hence, a university in Rewari was a must. Districts represented by Chief Ministers have always been lucky with Hisar now having three universities, the latest one being set up for veterinary sciences. Sirsa, too, has a university. Kiran Choudhry too, has been demanding a sports university for Bhiwani and has met the Congress top brass in Delhi in this regard along with her daughter, Shruti, who is an MP. In a separate letter, Choudhry, upset over the inaction on upgradation of schools in her district, is learnt to have written a letter to Education Minister Geeta Bhukkal. Choudhry had, in the Budget session of 2010, sought to know from the minister why the upgradation of schools had been hanging fire.To this, Bhukkal had said that the department was in the process of finalising a policy for upgradation of schools and the demand would be met if the schools met the requirements laid down by the new policy. The policy was approved in September last year. Choudhry, through her letter, has sought to know why the schools in her district continued to await upgradation. She is learnt to have written letters to other ministers as well on the status of pending projects in her district.","['universities', 'university', 'choudhry', 'schools', 'chandigarh', 'tribune', 'district', 'written', 'india', 'minister', 'yadav', 'upgradation', 'letter']","Two MLAs write to CM on lopsided developmentGeetanjali GayatriTribune News Service Chandigarh, January 11The written word carries weight and Congress men in Haryana seem to have discovered its benefits recently.

Consent of SGPC member not taken

Tribune News Service Mohali, June 12

Members of the Gurdwara Coordination Committee today released the list of its office-bearers without the consent of the local SGPC member, Mr Hardeep Singh. Stating that the SGPC member had no role to play in the committees working, which was a representative body of non-SGPC religious institutions in the township, the President of the committee, Mr Joginder Singh Sondhi, added that the committee would not tolerate any interference of the SGPC member. Declaring his allegiance to the SAD by holding a press conference at Phase XI Singh Sabha Gurdwara in the presence of party members Amrik Singh Mohali and Paramjit Singh Kahlon, Mr Sondhi today managed to shift the focus of the committee from religious issues to political ones. Mr Sondhi, the former president of the committee, claims that was unanimously elected President on May 28 following which today he selected his team in accordance with the committees constitution. Alleging that the SGPC member wanted to have his own members in the committee so that he could control it from outside, Mr Mohali said Hardeep Singh wanted Mr Tirlochan Singh Loch as the general secretary of the committee which was not acceptable to other members. Terming the whole affair as an attempt to divide the Sikh community on political lines, Mr Hardeep Singh said the election of Mr Sondhi as the president itself was illegal. According to the constitution of the committee, the local SGPC member is given the duty of conducting elections to the post of the president of the committee. In that capacity I have not issued any letter to Mr Sondhi stating that he is the President. Joginder Singh Sondhi proposed the name of Tirlochan Singh Loch as President and Sohan Singh Soods name was proposed by someone else. Mr Sondhis name for the post the president was never even proposed, he added. However, members of Mr Sondhis group pointed out that since no final decision could be taken between Mr Sood and Mr Loch it was decided to elect Mr Sondhi as president. Mr Sondhi was given the siropa by Mr Hardeep Singh before the Guru Granth Sahib in a large gathering. Why were objections not raised by him then about the presidentship? questioned a member of the Sondhi group. Mr Hardeep Singh said more than 20 members of the various institutions represented by the committee had handed over a written complaint to him alleging religious misconduct of on part of Mr Sood and Mr Sondhi. They had demanded that elections to the post of president be held again. I had constituted a fact finding committee to look into the allegations and also directed Mr Sondhi not to take any step till the committees reports are received. This renders todays list of office-bearers illegal. Interestingly six of the committee members, who have been chosen into the committee, are among those who complained to me against Mr Sondhi and Mr Sood, Mr Hardeep Singh said. Among those who have been elected office-bearers by Mr Sondhi are: Dr Sohan Singh Sood as the general secretary; Mr Swarn Singh Bhullar, Mr Swinder Singh Khokar, Mr Dalip Singh Malhi and Mr Jaswant Singh Natt as the senior vice-presidents; Mr Amar Singh, Mr Amrik Singh, Mr Hardial Singh Mann and Mr Rajinder Singh Mann as vice-presidents; Mr Manmohan Singh Lang as the secretary; Mr Mohinder Singh as the press secretary, Mr Nirmal Singh Bhurji and Mr Balwinder Singh Tohra as the cashiers, Mr Baldev Singh Sidhu as auditor, Mr Surjit Singh Mann as chairman, Dharam Prachar Committee, and Ms Balwinder Kaur Dhaliwal as deputy chairman of the Dharam Prachar Committee.

Gayatri Rajwade

Tribune News Service Chandigarh, November 25

Hope floats and catches each of these special children in its wake as they come together to present a theatrical production on the life of Swami Vivekananda. These youngsters from the Institute for the Blind, Sector 26, are an exceptional bunch and they bring their own special gifts to life as they play their parts proving they are better than the best. There is an air of heady excitement during the rehearsals and the 22 youngsters cluster around chatting, giggling, singing songs and enacting their roles in perfect tandem with one another. Each one has a story to recount about being here, about having learnt how to act. But it is not easy. You cannot just tell them to act. You have to explain everything physically, picking up their hand, telling them how to hold it, but it is amazing how intelligent they are and how fast they pick up, smiles Mrs Reva Gandhi, who is a member of the Inner Wheel Club of Chandigarh and is a volunteer. She had also been a part of their acting endeavours last year when they had staged a play on the life of Sant Kabir. Stories from the lives of great men like Swami Vivekananda and Kabir work positively in the minds of these youngsters, explains Ms Gandhi, a fact that is reiterated by what one of the actors had to say. Eighteen-year-old Shiv Kumar is one of three youngsters essaying the role of Swami Vivekananda in this play and to him has gone the distinction of playing Swami Vivekanands years in America. Last year, he had played Kabir. While acting, I really felt I was Kabir. Some roles just come into ones heart and I really tried to mould myself to this great saint. I tried to imagine how he would have dealt with situations while acting them out, he said with an earnestness that is inspiring. Shiv Kumar wants to be an actor and not being able to see is not a stumbling block in the least. I love acting because it helps get rid of inhibitions, he smiles. His best friend Rohit (21) is the music composer for the show and can play the harmonium, tabla, keyboard and even the banjo. Music is his passion and he is determined to be a music director or singer one day. So, what did he keep in mind while creating the music for this play? I try and ensure that the melody I create is neither too classical nor too modern so that it doesnt sound odd. It should fall easy on the ear, he says with remarkable poise like an expert. Sitting next to him is chatterbox Devi Singh who plays the role of Ramakrishna Paramhans but loves Bollywood songs. The play has evolved from director, producer, actor Shekhar Sens two-act musical mono-theatrical production by the same name. Ms Gandhis fellow helper Meetika Chauhan reworked the script which was then cut down to a little over an hour and divided up amongst the children by Indra Chibber (former Joint Secretary of the Institute and a former teacher at Vivek High School) who also got it converted into Braille. Indeed the zest and the poise these youngsters display is stirring for not only they play their parts they also know how to have lots of fun. They also teach us, in the process, how to really appreciate life. The play will be staged on November 28 at the DAV College Auditorium, Sector 10 at 11.45 am.","['really', 'swami', 'chandigarh', 'tribune', 'kabir', 'play', 'india', 'tried', 'vivekananda', 'acting', 'music', 'life', 'youngsters']","Visually challenged pick up acting skillGayatri RajwadeTribune News Service Chandigarh, November 25Hope floats and catches each of these special children in its wake as they come together to present a theatrical production on the life of Swami Vivekananda.

It seems no lesson has been learnt from incidents of the past - more recently the death of four persons in Sector 22 in April this year - for nothing else can explain the situation at the grain market in Sector 26, where a fire broke out this evening. While a major tragedy was averted after the fire broke out in a godown-cum-shop containing combustible materials, no apparent safety measures were in place to prevent a fire.

Dial D for de-stress

By Nonika Singh P ICK up your phone and unburden yourself, vent your suppressed feelings, satiate your forbidden curiosities. Indeed way back in 1876 when Alexander Graham Bell, a Scottish-born American, invented electromagnetic telephone, who could have imagined that one day his invention would not only usher in a communication revolution but also find usage in psychiatric counselling. Yet in todays jet-set pace when stress has spread its tentacles far and wide, telecounselling has become a vital tool to reach out to distressed souls and to provide a balm to their frayed nerves. Tele-counselling made its presence felt on the global map roughly three decades ago. In India it is a recent phenomenon. It has filtered down from metros to relatively smaller cities like Chandigarh which now boasts of a round-the-clock voice response system available on telephone number 1097 and answers queries related to AIDS. Sponsored by NACO, the AIDS hotline (only the third in the country) is being run by the Chandigarh AIDS Cell and the Servants of People Society (Chandigarh chapter). The Servants of People Society, founded in 1921 by martyr Lala Lajpat Rai, has been involved in philanthropic causes like drug de-addiction and senior citizens welfare. According to Onkar Chand, secretary of the society, the hotline is a testimony to the fact the government and a non-government organisation can work in tandem for public welfare. While the enlightened amongst us are acutely conscious of the HIV threat, Indias ignorant and illiterate populace is oblivious to the burgeoning number of HIV-infected people in India. As per the AIDS control programme, there are nearly 3.5 million HIV-infected persons in India. By the year 2000, India might have the unenviable distinction of possessing the largest number of HIV- infected persons if concerted efforts are not taken in the right direction. Tele-counselling is one way to disseminate information and quell myths which abound in plenty. Though the requisite software developed at a cost of Rs 2 lakh is designed to answer eight routine questions  What is AIDS, how does it spread, delineation between AIDS and HIV, relation with STD et al  the counsellors with the help of medical experts had to devise 1500 new answers. Renu Sharma, a counsellor with the hotline,says: ""Lack of awareness about the disease has led to many a misconception. Only recently someone enquired whether a chimpanzee bite could cause AIDS. Then there was a query-- whether meat eaters are more susceptible? Our job is to clear the cobwebs shrouding the dreaded disease"". Though the system is guided by experts, one wonders about the effectiveness of pre-fed answers? As it is doubts exist about this faceless mode of counselling. In the USA and Europe, doubts were voiced when tele-counselling was introduced. But later the interposition of media between the counsellor and the counselled was widely accepted. Computers came to occupy an independent status in psychotherapy. The lack of direct interaction in tele-counselling is its biggest strength. Rekha Gupta, the other counsellor in charge of the hotline,remarks: ""It deters pranksters from making crank calls as there is little fun in playing around with a computerised voice."" Group Captain (retd) P.S. Soni, honorary administrator with the society, adds: "" A counsellors voice might betray emotional nuances when prodded with an uncomfortable question, thus desisting a caller from making a call. So pre-fed answers have an edge as those desirous of seeking information can question without any qualms or inhibitions. ""In a nation like India where a visit to a psychiatrist can leave you branded insane for life, tele-counselling is bound to elicit tremendous response Small wonder then that Chandigarhs, first tele-counselling service Dost (also under the auspices of the Servants of People Society), evoked enthusiasm. In one year alone, Dost handled 541 queries. Predictably and ironically in this land of Kamasutra where today sex has become a dirty word, a large number of queries were related to one or the other sexual problem. As AIDS too is inextricably linked to sex, the response to the AIDS hotline has been overwhelming to put it mildly. When the service became operational in January, 1999, the callers numbered 3361; and in the month of March (by 17th), the tribe totalled a staggering 8525 --- which means roughly 500 calls a day. While Dost turned out to be more of a a friend in distress for the so-called stronger sex, at the AIDS hotline too the majority of the callers have been male. The raison de etre for this gender anomaly could be the fact that women have their own empathy groups and crying on each others shoulders is quite in line with gender expectations. For men however any expression or emotional outburst remains un- macho. As Dr Avneesh Jolly, co-ordinator, AIDS hotline, says: ""I have always been tickled by the blank calls so rampant in our country. Behind those blank gaps, I can sense an insistent urge of the callers to lend a voice to their thoughts."" So whatever happened to the traditional support systems built in our social cultural fabric which for ages have served as proxy shrinks? Dr Jolly feels, ""Today, peer group is breaking up. Friendship has been replaced by rivalry and jealousy. Besides Nani and Dadi, excellent counsellors of yore, are conspicuous by their absence, thanks to division of joint families."" So now faith healers and soothsayers have stepped in. But instead of guiding their bhakts, they end up exploiting them. For that matter even tele-counselling is not a panacea for societal ills. It serves little purpose if it is not followed up with face-to-face counselling. Besides in the hands of amateurs, it could become an instrument of personal aggrandisement. A counsellor might be tempted to impose his own prejudices, thus confounding the caller further. Onkar Chand says that the second phase of the service would include face-to-face counselling as well. Though so far the hotline has been just an awareness line, he insists that those in dire need will most certainly be guided by the service. With the psychiatrist-patient ratio in India being so lopsided, the significance of such services cant be ignored. But as Dr Jolly reflects,""Apart from roping in barefoot counsellors and volunteers tele-counselling has to be supported by pressure groups on the lines of say Alcoholic Anonymous. Only then can it become truly relevant.""

Soni, honorary administrator with the society, adds: "" A counsellors voice might betray emotional nuances when prodded with an uncomfortable question, thus desisting a caller from making a call.

Lacking the discipline to focus on any one thing for long made it impossible for her to channel her energy into a job or business. Her husband had enough money and would not have discouraged her, had she been serious about pursuing a vocation. She remained on tenterhooks, easily excitable and convinced she was being used and abused by everyone. This feeling gnawed at her and led to severe mood swings. ""My husband is boring and predictable. Given a choice, he would choose his office over me. My parents couldnt be bothered. Had I their support, I would have walked out of this non-happening marriage ages ago. My in-laws are image conscious. They are condescending, as if forced to tolerate my buffooning ways. Our social crowd is vicious. Had a different set of people inhabited my world I would have been happy and motivated enough to actualise my potential."" What started off as acceptable social drinking threatened to become a habit. Downing two rum-cokes, vodka-orange juices or beer-limcas seemed harmless. Her husband did not mind, chivalrous young men offered to make her a drink and the bottomline was she enjoyed it. A drink made her feel lighter, she slept better and the world didnt seem such a bad place after all. Trouble started when the amount she drank at social dos seemed inadequate. Anita who had earlier hated forced socialising did not resent it so much now. It gave her a pretext to drink. She would steal a drink or two from her husbands bar before leaving, have a couple at the party and on returning home have some more. Her husband was not much of a drinker and he usually hit the bed on their return. Sleep eluded her and a few drinks helped. Anita was intelligent enough to know that her growing dependence on alcohol was not normal. However, she was not prepared to face this reality squarely. It was convenient to go on a binge, misbehave at times, embarrass the family and feel guilty the morning after. She always found enough reasons and excuses to justify the drinking, telling herself that she could stop the day she wanted to. Her husband and in-laws, by now, knew they had a problem on their hands but it was easier to deny it, treat it as an aberration and cover it up. They still had no idea of how much she was consuming. By now, she had to have a drink first thing in the morning, ""to collect myself and send the girls to school"". Since she was working, it was not difficult to buy her own liquor and stash it in a remote corner of her cupboard or shoe rack. In moments of acute need she hit her husbands bar. The situation deteriorated and her drinking acquired a major nuisance value. The family was up in arms realising there was little they could do to ""cover it up"", it was becoming difficult to hold on to her job and she knew she needed help. She had, by now, sunk low in her own estimation. She was aware of how her teenaged daughters were getting impacted by having to bear with a ""drunken mom"". The definitive moment came when her husband summoned her parents, apprised them of the situation and asked them to take charge of their daughter. Her father, a retired Army officer, had handled many crises but this numbed him. He knew sermonising would not help. She could not give up alcohol without medical, psychological and spiritual intervention. Doctors could flush it out, clean the system and put her on medication. They could treat her for damage that was still reversible. How would they deal with her emotional and mental state? A friend suggested Alcoholic Anonymous. But wasnt that something that existed only in America ? And even if it did have a chapter here, would his daughter be comfortable rubbing shoulders with fellow drunks ? The image he could conjure was that of truck drivers and good-for-nothing alcoholics. A meeting with the coordinator in a city close to his, changed that. He decided to take Anita to Delhi which had Asias only womens group. Anita allowed herself to be taken. She wanted to give up alcohol and knew she could not do it on her own. But the anxiety of facing a group and admitting she was an alcoholic was too much. By the time she stumbled into the little room housed in the backyard of the Masigarh Church (Sukhdev Vihar), she was in her own words ""sozzled"". The instant rapport was magical, in that it brought her back for the next meeting. When she walked in she said, "" I know I am a bad woman, a mad woman and an immoral woman."" To which they said, "" you are neither bad, mad nor immoral. You are just a sick woman. You have an illness and it can be cured."" This pronouncement was such a relief. To find people who had reached rock-bottom after drinking for 30-35 years and yet given it up provided her with a ray of hope. It was not easy to resolve and stay off alcohol but the support group and the affection, understanding and accountability that came from their frank discussions made it seem achievable. Gradually, she (like the others) found that God helps those who help themselves. There were occasional relapses but the group helped her tide over them. She knew that for an alcoholic like her there was no middle-of-the-road approach. She could never be a social drinker, content with having an occasional drink. If she drank it would be unstoppable, as if there was no tomorrow. There was no other way than to give it up entirely. She did that and today she voluntarily gives the group her time, talking to fresh entrants, telling them that if she could do it, they certainly can. She admits ""earlier I felt that everyone around me was wrong. Today they are the same. It is me who has changed and along with that change has come the awareness of life, beauty, god and love. I gave up alcohol not for others but for myself.""","['knew', 'anita', 'drinking', 'group', 'tribune', 'husband', 'alcohol', 'help', 'woman', 'drink', 'social']","Had a different set of people inhabited my world I would have been happy and motivated enough to actualise my potential.""

This fix can ruin your life

Gamblers Anonymous comes to the aid of individuals addicted to betting. They land in a spot, as their careers and family lives are hit

Taru Bahl F or Kartik, harmless gambling started with stakes of Rs1000 which quickly graduated to those ten times higher and before he knew, in one cricket season he lost as much as Rs4 lakh. A fresh graduate, into his first job, he scraped through and paid bookies and money lenders by borrowing from friends. By the time the next set of tournaments began, he was deep into the betting cycle  desperately chasing losses. Within a year, he was a sports junkie, betting on any game beamed on the telly. Three years down the line, he lost Rs 30 lakh, along with the confidence of family and friends. A nervous wreck, he vacillated from feelings of denial, desperation, anger, acceptance and is now finally into rehab. Coming from a wealthy family, it was easy for him to get a chance to fix his life. Not all are as lucky. Twentyone-year-old Anirudh found it exciting as he watched his parents play flash on Diwali eve. When friends asked him to join them for poker, he did it for a lark. In one evening he won Rs10,000. Then began a series of poker nights. When losses mounted, at the behest of friends, he tried his hand at cricket gambling and before he knew it, was deep into the world of bookies, money lenders and people who stood as guarantors. He lost close to Rs 20 lakh, mortgaging his laptop, cameras, iphone, play station and even selling his mother's gold bangles. His grades dropped, friends circle shrunk and his only companions were his mobile phone, a few sim cards, television in his room and a bunch of people he spoke to desperately late into the night to juggle borrowings that allowed him to be ""active"" to sustain the betting habit. When T-20 and World Cup series, the most sought after cricket matches, were not on, he was glued to the telly to watch and bet on any match. Now he is a regular with the weekly Gambling Anonymous meetings which have helped him stay clean for 100 days. Surge in betting Gambling in India is restricted. Despite this, an estimated 40 per cent internet users visit gambling sites primarily for lottery, cricket and horse betting. The Public Gambling Act of 1867 prohibits running or being in charge of a public gaming house. The penalty for breaking the law is a fine of Rs 200 or imprisonment of up to three months. But this has not kept budding and seasoned gamblers at bay. ""In fact, numbers have spiralled and young upwardly mobile boys and even girls and housewives are taking to betting via the internet. The ease with which it can be done has put many gamblers in a spot, affecting their careers, family lives and most importantly, their state of mind,"" says a Mumbai-based stock market agent- turned-bookie who started by placing bets himself and seeing how lucrative it is, took to it full time. Daily, he witnesses young people lying, stealing and indulging in criminal activity to support the habit but he is not here to play moral guardian and is only interested in getting what is owed to him. The surge in online gambling can be seen in a report by Media and Entertainment Consulting Network (MECN) that estimates the entire Indian gambling industry to be worth $60 billion, back in 2009. With greater internet penetration, this has only grown manifold. ""Gambling has been around, from the days of the Mahabharata with Yudhishthir putting his wife, Drapuadi at stake to countless men losing family fortunes over lottery, cards and races. Today it is more prevalent because it is easily accessible. All it takes is a call or click of a mouse to place a bet,"" says Kaveri, a 'caregiver'. First it was her husband who was an alcoholic and now it is her son who in the last 18 years has lost all the family property. She stresses the need for a support group for caregivers who can share and learn ways of coping with a complex condition. Not only does the addict need help but also the caregiver who battles intense feelings of inadequacy as well as anger, frustration and confusion. The addict remains oblivious to the paranoia he creates with his lying and manipulative, deceitful behaviour. She goes regularly for Codependents Anonymous (CODA) meetings in Delhi and feels they saved her from going 'mad'. ""It helped me deal with my addict son in a more clinical and constructive manner. I finally understood that I need to be okay first before I can deal with him."" Self esteem issues According to an alumni of DAIRRC run by Yusuf Merchant in Mumbai, ""Most addicts are low on self esteem. A common thread runs through each of them, whether they are addicted to sports betting, cards and horses or sex, shopping or mobile texting. The programme I did was for more than a year, where recovery and healing were so extensive that when I stepped into the real world, I could be surrounded by temptation and yet hold my ground and say ""no"" to drugs. I understood that for me, unlike my friends, dabbling in it just once would make me plummet to depths of the very hopelessness I had just emerged from."" He emphasises that the addict needs to be pulled out of his current environment and put in a place where there are people who understand and work with him to overcome his compulsive disorder, which if left unaddressed consumes him and all those around him. He says that post the programme, his relationships with his siblings, parents and girlfriend improved. More than others, he was surprised to see that the treatment took out the liar and manipulator in him, leaving behind a regular person with aspirations to do something constructive with his life. ""All through the addiction I was seen as a certain kind of person which I now realised was not me, but my addictive behaviour. For the first time in many years, I acquainted myself with who I was and what I wanted to be,"" he adds.

Gamblers Anonymous is still in its fledgling stage and it takes courage for addicts to overcome the fear of stigma and social disapproval to seek help Photos by Aamit Khanna

While there is no dedicated rehab for gambling in India, there are places where people with addictive behaviours are counselled. Dr Ashwini Kumar who runs Santulan in Delhi, says, ""Gambling is like any other addiction which is afflicted with all the d's - dealth of a loved one, debt and divorce. In the acute addictive phase, it is manifested through events like losing a job, having a run-in with crime, theft, extortion and even suicide."" He explains that the period of recovery first entails admitting helplessness or powerlessness before seeking help and protection from an external source. He says there are no instant or permanent cures. Rather, ""battling addiction is a lifelong struggle and condition that has to be managed. The recovering addict has to be constantly aware of his vulnerability to succumb to temptation and put in place safeguards that include changing company, not watching television, saying no to card parties etc and for caregivers too to be watchful at all times."" In other words, it is a bio-psychosocial disease, just like blood pressure or hypertension. The person's lifestyle and even career needs to therefore fit into the disease not the other way round. According to the Delhi Gambling Anonymous group, which began having meetings a year ago, ""while Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings are well attended, Gambling Anonymous is still in its fledgling stage. Stigma, fear of being exposed and denial come in the way of people stepping out and admitting they have a problem and need help."" SBK Singh, Joint Commissioner, Crime, New Delhi, points out that gambling per se is not an offence, but if in a public place it is. Also, with the coming of the Justice Juvenile Act, one cannot arrest those less than 18 years of age. The solution lies within society and family. Parents have to put pressure on their children and wards to explain and demonstrate to them the consequences of their actions. They have to be the first counsellors.

Need to build bridges of communications between industry, institutes

Tribune News Service Panchkula, February 19

In a fast-changing world where technologies become obsolete overnight, the two-day National Workshop on Industry Institute Interaction (NWIII-2007), today, focussed on the need to build bridges of communication between the industry and technical institutes churning out skilled work force. Academics and industrialists were unanimous about the fact that the present curriculum being followed in ITIs needs to be changed in consonance with the needs of the industry. Further, the speakers held the view that it needs translation into skill formation rather than confining itself to imparting theoretical knowledge. The Haryana Education Minister, Mr Phool Chand Mullana, in his inaugural address at the workshop organised by National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra, said that Haryana Government was committed to excellence in technical education quality. ""The budget for technical education has been increased to Rs 90 crore in 2006-07 compared to Rs 50 crores in 2005-06. The World Bank also deserved kudos for its Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP), initiated to strengthen the technical education system,"" he stated. Mr C.B.Mathur, Chairman, Board of Governors, NIT Kurukshetra, presided over the inaugural session. He assured that NIT Kurukshetra would be ever ready to take the lead in promoting the ties between industry and institute and would act as a nodal centre for collaboration with the industries. Dr M.N. Bandyopadhyay, Director, NIT, Kurukshetra, emphasised on the need for more memorandums of understanding (MoUs) between industries and institutes. Dr R.P.Hooda, Vice- Chancellor, Kurukshetra University, Kurukshetra, said the scale of operation of industries had increased immensely. ""Even small-scale units have grown into huge establishments. It's really time for us to go beyond the designing of courses. We must ensure that these get translated into action and contribute to the skill of the student,"" he stated. The Chairman of CII, Mr Adesh Gupta, said implementation was the most important part of any project. ""Institutes must learn to implement what is planned for them. We have a successful IIT model which must be adopted for quality,"" he said. Coming down heavily on the present status of summer trainings for passouts from technical institutes, Mr Gupta said interns hardly did anything. ""They copy old reports and present them to the faculty, get graded on those and get a certificate. This should be checked since it is in nobody's interest,"" Mr Gupta maintained. He stated that the dormant interaction cells in technical institutes needed to be activated and suggested that stating a course in solar energy management would be a good idea to meet the challenge presented by shrinking sources of energy. Holding that the interaction aims to bring out a road map showing steps to be taken by these two sectors to improve the interaction among themselves, specific time base activities, the speakers added that the industry and the institutions would both gain from the deliberations. The Vice-Chancellor of Guru Jambeshwar University, Dr RP Bajpai, speaking about the mismatch between the job and the training provided, said the responsibility of bridging the gap had to be shared equally by the institutions that provided the training and the industry that provided the jobs. While on the one hand the industry had a stellar role to play by providing inputs on curriculum design, infrastructure development, faculty training among others, on the other, the institutions needed to remain in constant touch with the industry through consultancy and research in an increasingly competitive global market, he added.

Workhorses of yore to fly past during IAF fleet review

Vijay Mohan

Tribune News Service Chandigarh, February 19

For IAF veterans it would be a nostalgic moment when the Air Forces workhorses of yore, Canberra bombers and Avro transport aircraft stage a fly past during the Presidential Fleet Review (PFR), scheduled to be held here on March 7. It is after a very long time that these aircraft would be participating in a fly-past, a senior officer at the Air Force Station here remarked. The IAF latest acquisition, the Embraer jet for VVIP transport, may also feature in the fly-past, thought its inclusion is not yet finalised, sources added. Almost all aircraft and weapon systems in the IAFs inventory would feature in the PFR Once the mainstay of the IAFs bomber fleet, only a few Canberras now remain in service. Inducted in 1957, these were used extensively for bombing and interdiction missions during the Indo-Pak wars. With about 58 years of service, perhaps the longest ever for a combat aircraft, these are now used for strategic reconnaissance. Having bought over a 100 Canberras of different variants from the United Kingdom, the IAF became the largest user of this aircraft apart from the Royal Air Force. It also formed part of the Indian peace keeping force deployed in Congo under a United Nations mandate. The British HS-748 Avro, which made its appearance in the Indian skies in 1964, was the workhorse of the IAF transport fleet before the arrival of the Russian AN-12 and thereafter, the AN-32. About 30 Avros are reported to be in service and are mainly used for training, communication and VVIP transport. Some of these aircraft are being further modified and upgraded. Sources said about 20 aircraft formations, including those of fighters, transport and helicopters, would be participating in the fly-past. Fighter formations would comprise five aircraft each, mostly in arrow-head formation, while the composition of transport and helicopter formations would vary. The most noticeable formation would be combat aircraft forming the figure of 75 to mark the IAFs Platinum Jubilee. Several formations today carried out dry runs over the Chandigarh air base to try out various flight paths for the fly-past. The purpose was to select the flight path which would give maximum visibility to ground audience. This would be the IAFs fourth PFR. The first two were held at Palam in April, 1954 and April, 1972. The third was held at Chandigarh on January 19, 1976, which was reviewed by the then President, Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed. This included a fly-past by 43 fighters comprising 23 MiG-21s and 20 Su-7s. The parade consisted of 823 officers and airmen along with a line-up of Mi-8, Aloutte and Cheetah, along with An-12, Gnat, Fairchild, Packet, Canberra, Hunter, Su-7 and MiG 21 aircraft.

Yet to provide security to women during night shifts

Ruchika M. Khanna

Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 16

The spread of IT and ITEs sector in the tricity has drawn up new challenges for the administration. As more and more women are now going out to work in the BPOs (business process outsourcing) and call centres that now dot the region, their security has become prime concern. The recent incident in Pune, where a woman employee of a call centre was raped, has once again raised this vital issue. Excluding big BPOs and IT companies here, most of the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the IT sector have failed to address this concern, even as almost 50 per cent of their employees happen to be women. These SMEs have made provision for dropping and picking up their employees, who work on the night shifts, but the antecedents of the cab drivers are rarely checked. Refana, an employee of Infosys, says that the security of employees is of prime concern for big IT companies like Infosys. If we get late in the office, its cab drops us. Besides a driver, a guard is also sent in the cab for our safety, she adds. In fact, most of the big IT companies follow certain security guidelines which lists out how the antecedents of the drivers are to be checked, and how the guards are to be sent out in the cabs during night hours. Security is something no one will compromise on. Most of the companies share these security guidelines. Any lapse in security will not only bring a bad name to the company, but also hamper its future recruitment process, says a senior human resource official in Dell. Unfortunately, the same is not true for the SMEs here. The information gathered by the Chandigarh Tribune reveals that most of these companies have entered into contract with car rental companies, who provide vehicles for ferrying staff to different location. These cab owners have in turn hired drivers on contract basis, says Anupama Sharma, who recently quit her job in a Mani Majra-based BPO. Women are generally apprehensive if they are the first ones to be picked up, or the last ones to be dropped after a night shift. They are left at the mercy of these drivers. Parents of two of my colleagues would keep track of their daughters while they were in the office cabs, by speaking to them on the mobile till the time they had not reached the office or the home safely. The fact that the night patrolling in the satellite towns of Panchkula and Mohali, and in the southern sectors of the city is quite bad also enhances the risk factor for women employees. Says an employee with a Mohali- based call centre, One night as I was being driven home to Sector-49, a few youths in a car started following us. Since there was no PCR en route, it made us very nervous. It was only because of the swiftness of the driver that we were able to dodge them. Though the Pune incident has now created awareness about the safety concern of employees and the senior administration officials are asking IT companies to pull up its socks, it remains to be seen how far these security concerns are addressed.","['companies', 'security', 'chandigarh', 'tribune', 'cab', 'india', 'smes', 'drivers', 'night', 'office', 'employees', 'women', 'concern']","COMMUNITY SMEs leave women at cab drivers mercyYet to provide security to women during night shiftsRuchika M.

Says this will remove imbalance in urban and rural areas

Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 6

The Minister of State for Finance, Mr Pawan Kumar Bansal, today endorsed the plan of the Chandigarh Administration to regularise constructions in the 'pherni' of the UT villages. This was the only way out to bring the villages at par with the urban areas, he said. Addressing a 'Rural Conference' at Kajheri village here today, Mr Bansal, who is the Member of Parliament from Chandigarh, said it was necessary to bring the villages under Municipal Corporation to remove the imbalance in the urban and rural areas. The inclusion would bring the rural property at par with the urban property. Pointing towards the gram panchayats which were protesting against the inclusion of villages in the Municipal Corporation, he said there was misconception which was being exploited by opposition parties. Mr Didar Singh, Chairman of the Panchayat Samiti, while sharing the dias with the MP, said the consent of the Panchayats and other representatives of the villages should be taken before effecting the inclusion. Though the show of strength by the Congress was staged to show that there were few takers for the non-inclusion of the villages in the Municipal Corporation, a few sarpanches and representatives of the Panchayati Raj institutions were conspicuous by their absence from the conference. Assuring the villagers that no construction outside the Lal Dora would be demolished, the minister said the relevance of lal dora had lost its significance. The land would be exempted from the Periphery Control Act for planning for growth up to 2021. An environment shield will be developed around villages to mark the area beyond which no construction will be allowed. In a proposal of the UT Administration to cover all UT villages in the Municipal Corporation, the UT has decided to include five villages in the first step including Hallo Majra, Dadu Majra, Maloya, Palsora and Kajheri. Mr Bhupinder Badheri, General Secretary of the Chandigarh Territorial Congress Committee, said inclusion of villages in the MC would save the structures outside the lal dora. He called upon the leaders of all political parties to support the cause of the villagers. Mr Surinder Singh, Mayor of the Municipal Corporation, said for the pockets in Mani Majra and Deep Complex, Hallo Majra, against which the Administration had issued notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, exemption would be taken. At least 15 representatives of the villagers in a recent memorandum to the Deputy Commissioner had opposed the move to include all the villages in the MC. While participating in the conference, the representatives of the Welfare Society of the 50 UT villagers Capital Project Chandigarh, protested against the failure of the MP in rehabilitating their uprooted families. A memorandum of the society was given to the MP. They demanded the 1950 rehabilitation scheme for the 5000 families of the oustees.","['rural', 'chandigarh', 'tribune', 'india', 'urban', 'municipal', 'mr', 'representatives', 'corporation', 'ut', 'villages', 'villagers']","This was the only way out to bring the villages at par with the urban areas, he said.

Public servants turning khaas aadmis This is with reference to Raveen Thukrals write up, The khas aadami, published in Chandigarh Tribune on August 3. Politicians, police and bureaucrats manipulated a self-justified perception of security risk to avail the facility of police escorts just to use them as their and their familys personal servants, these police escorts openly misuse the public land, use free electricity and water by unauthorised connections and have become a public nuisance. The so-called VVIP wards often misuse their police guards to thrash their opponents and exhibit a vulgar show of power. It is more astonishing that in spite of being reported by the media repeatedly, no action is being taken by the higher authorities to end this menace. Chief Ministers of both the states, Directors General of Police and the Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana High Court are the silent spectators of this wilful violation of the law of the land. Why a licence is given to such officials to break the well-established norms of the society and the law of the land. In a Democratic system like ours, every one is equal to law, which must be adhered in the letters and spirit. The high court must bring such violators to justice by honouring the strong public and medias reaction on this issue. Capt Amar Jeet Kumar, Mohali VIPs flaunt status You have written a very hard-hitting piece on VIPs. But does writing such article works, when the VIP will remain the same and continue to scare the aam aadmi! You have rightly said, ""But alas! whatever the law might say, the truth is that VIPs do enjoy a khaas status in our society and moreover, they love to flaunt it."" It gives a lot of pain to see India, when compared to Canada and other western countries. Prikshat Verma, Canada Common man suffers Social activists are clamouring for a check of the mindset of the power brigade. But will this mindset change come voluntarily is what haunts the common person. A poor man steals power for his use because the administration has failed to provide the electricity. The electricity department was forced to withdraw disconnecting kundi connections in Colony No 5 in the wake of protests in the form of roadblocks by the jhuggi-dwellers. It will remain helpless to enforce the disconnection owing to the power wielded by the VIPs. It is clear that the Electricity Act 2003 providing for fines and punishment is no deterrent to this dominant class of people and relates only to a common man. Satish Chandra Sharma Practical difference Although the Constitution of India has not recognised any difference between the khaas and aam aadmi, Being a VIP in our country is like a blank cheque encashable anywhere. It is unfortunate that VIPs end up making a mockery of it with impunity. No VIP or celebrity in our country can be booked on the petty charge of drunk driving, on which The Alexandria, Fairfax County Police Chief, was arrested by the Arlington County Police. When persons like Sanjeev Nanda could get away with just two years imprisonment in the BMW case because of his clout even after killing six persons, it is difficult to imagine politicians and bureaucrats behaving like Aam aadmi. Most of the protectees enjoying VIP security on government expense are not under any real threat to their lives. Pruning of VIP security to undeserving protectees may save several crores of taxpayers hard-earned money annually. Lajpat Rai Garg, Panchkula Overhaul mindset In his bold and eye-opening write up, Raveen Thukral has painstakingly brought forward another issue of not only public interest but also imbibing greater moral value in his bona fide endeavours to shake our moribund conscience to awake to see the meaning of democratic republic. Whichever government is in power, it considers the state its private estate and people as servile only for exploitation. We, therefore, as citizens of a democratic republic of India, should obey and respect laws of the land, do our work or assigned duty honestly and conscientiously and resist undue pressure of the vested interests howsoever great they may be. To achieve the noble goal of fearless and free life, as aam aadmi, we must overhaul our mindset and act valorously not to succumb to the undue pressures of the powers if we want a truly democratic republic of India. Gurmit Singh Saini, Mohali Need to take revolutionary steps It is true that in our country a khaas aadmi is khaas, while aam aadmi is aam till some revolutionary steps are not taken to remove the difference. Whenever a khaas aadmi is entangled in some scam, he immediately needs medical help, as that is the safest way for him to escape such scams. I have never seen any forces accompanying VIPs in other countries. The simple reason is that the life of a khaas aadmi in our country is precious so he needs protection and that of aam aadmi is not so precious. Rakesh Ahluwalia, Ambala City VIP culture only in India The VIP culture is found in India only. In other countries there are no such people called the VIPs. Every person is equal in the eyes of the law. But in India, anyone who is given a responsible position treats himself above the law. They feel they can violate the laws without being punished. If these so called khaas aadmis give up their habit of violating the law, I am sure the aam aadmi in our country will never dare to break the laws. Everyone is equal in status and respect in the US. It is only in our country where the VIP culture prevails. Ours is surely a feudalistic country.

COUNSELLING DATES CLASH: Students seeking admission in Engineering colleges of Punjab Technical University, as well as College of Agricultural Engineering, Punjab Agricultural University, are in a fix as the date of counselling for both the courses coincides. The students said counselling to both the courses has been scheduled on August 8 for the reserved category and August 9 for the general category and it would not be possible for the students to appear in both the centres on the same day. DECLARE MERIT LIST: Candidates of the reserved categories, from the district, who have been seeking admission to Sri Guru Ram Das Medical College, Amritsar, are annoyed as their merit list has yet not been declared. The students said a list had been displayed for the general category students but not for those falling under the reserved quota. They said this had caused much trouble to those coming from far off places to know about the results. The students from Chaukiman village, Sidhwan Kalan and Jagraon who had applied under the reserved category for rural candidates said when they went to Amritsar the officials concerned told them that they might be ineligible as their parents were working as government employees. The students said this condition was not mentioned earlier and alleged that the new rule was made to give admissions to some preferred candidates of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, which manages the college affairs. CERTIFICATION: Top Careers and You  commonly known as TCY has achieved the rare distinction of achieving ISO 9001 certification. TCY has been the first Indian test preparation organisation, in its segment, to achieve the distinction, said Mr Kamal, CEO of the company. The organisation had been started three years back with a single minded approach toward quality and results and though our certifying body is TUV, Germany, which is very strict on standards, we didnt have to face much difficulty in obtaining the certification. Our endeavour is to assign each faculty member to his area of expertise so as to give our students the best of inputs he said. MANDI GOBINDGARH

""I would ensure the daily lifting of the garbage from these colonies but would also like to request people to dump the garbage in a more responsible and hygienic way as after all it is them who are the most affected from this menace, ""said Chatwal.

Also, Manpreet Singh Chatwal, the Municipal Commissioner of Jalandhar assured that till the time JDA makes some alternate arrangements to dump the garbage of these colonies, he would ensure daily lifting of garbage from the site. Also, he said efforts would be taken soon to make some arrangements in the colonies already handed over to the MC by the JDA.

""Since, no dumping site was allocated at the time of planning these colonies; it is difficult to allocate some area now. But, we will try to make a temporary arrangement by allocating some vacant plot as a temporary garbage dumping site in these colonies,"" said Khehra.

Accepting the lapse, Gurpreet Singh Khehra, Chief Administrator, JDA, said it has indeed brought to his notice that these colonies does not have even a single dumping site of its own causing the residents to dump the garbage in the open space in front of the PIMS and assured that soon action would be taken into the matter.

""Here, you cannot blame our civic sense as the colonies developed by PUDA have no garbage dumping site of its own. Where should we throw the litter? Even the MC does not lift the garbage on daily-basis resulting stray animals to scatter in prominently on the Garha road,"" said Kuldeep Singh, a resident of Choti Baradari Phase I.

Although the Punjab Urban Development Authority (PUDA) had made plush and swanky colonies like the Choti Baradari Phase I and II and the Urban Estate part I and II, but in one of the biggest lapse ever in the colonising infrastructure, it forgot to allocate a centralised dumping site in any of its colonies. Finding no place, the residents of these colonies initially throw the garbage in a nearby empty plot but once it gets occupied, conveniently throw the litter on this man-made dumping site which has been reserved for plots/shops by the Jalandhar Improvement Trust (JDA) from the last few years.

""It seems that neither the Municipal Corporation (MC) nor the PIMS authorities are bothered about the well being of the city residents and are waiting for another epidemic break in the city. As it is the main link road to reach Garha, many people like me are everyday threatened by stray animal hovering on the open garbage area and occasionally coming in between the fast moving traffic on the Garha road,"" said Puneet Sharma, a student of a Garha-based coaching institute.

The stench and ugly sight of waste dumped along the two gates of the hospital not only presents an ugly picture to the hospital visitors but also stray dogs, crows, cows and pigs rummaging through the 'all you can eat garbage' buffet cause lot of inconvenience to the commuters passing on the busy Garha road.

Steps needed to check liquor supply

From Our Correspondent KURUKSHETRA, Dec 16  While it is often observed that children, where liquor flows freely, acquire drinking habit at an early age. Dr S.P. Singh said it requires more research to explain why the children of alcoholic parents consume a fixed dose of alcohol as compared to those of non-alcoholic parents. This was stated by Dr S.P. Singh, professor emeritus and convener of the UGC panel in Chemistry. He was giving a lecture before the university and college teachers on the distrubing trend of drug abuse at the UGC-sponsored refresher course in Environmental Education at Kurukshetra University here today. Dr Singh said that it had been established that easy availability of liquor (or any other drug) made it more likely to be abused. Steps were thus needed to check the supply by putting more hurdles to procure a chemical particularly the ones which were relatively more harmful, said Dr Singh. According to Dr Singh rehabilitation of alcoholics is a difficult task as many of them take to drinking after a period of abstinence. Apart from medicines, family support and professional counseling need to be encouraged. Voluntary organisations such as Alcoholic Anonymous that has men who had stopped drinking can play a far bigger role in the management of alcoholism.







Cattle train detained for days

From Vijendra Ahlawat FARIDABAD, Dec 16  The detention of the Cattle special train of the Railways here for more than four days has led to the erruption of a major controversy over the role of some organisations claiming to be involved in safeguarding the welfare and interests of animals. While it caused undue harassment to both the local administration and the Railways, the unfortunate episode has taken the life of at least seven head of cattle, including five calves. About 288 cows unloaded from the train are still awaiting to be reloaded to reach their destination. The special train carrying 634 high-breed milching cows, had been booked from Kila Raipur in Punjab for Howrah, near Calcutta, was intercepted and stopped near the old Faridabad railway station on the directions of a Union Minister. The minister and activists of some organisations who halted the train reportedly claimed that the cows were allegedly being taken for slaughter and so it must be stopped here for a probe. As soon as the train halted the district authorities rushed to the site with a team of veterinary doctors on December 10. According to the check-up report submitted to the authorities, it was found that all cows were healthy and were of good breed and had been booked by a party for sale to another party at the Howrah station. It is reported that no intention of slaughtering them was detected as alleged by the organisations, including the people for Animals (PFA), Bajrang Dal and Vishwa Hindu Parishad. The loading of the cows was also found in proper condition. Although the district administration allowed the train to move ahead on the same day but due to some technical reasons it could not do so. Meanwhile about 300 activists of the afforesaid organisations assembled on the spot, demanding that the train should not be allowed to move, reiterating their allegation. Although the local authorities again allowed the train to move in the morning of December 11, the Railway Police demanded deploying of adequate police force to check any problem of law and order. The Railway Police also registered a case against some of the animal keepers travelling in the train for possessing some Oxytocin injections, whose use for milking purpose of the cattle is banned under the Act of Prevention of Cruelity to Animals. Meanwhile, on a petition moved by the PFA, the civil court here stayed the movement of the train and directed the authorities to unload the cows and put them in Goshalas here. This put an unusual burden on the district authorities, who have to make all arrangements itself as no organisation claiming to be animal lover, came forward to look after the cows. The SDM, Mr Jitender Dahiya said the administration not only provided medical facilities round the clock, but also supplied about 52 bags of feed, five trolleys of fodder, arrangement for light in the train and 50 trucks to unload the cows. While 22 bogies containing 346 cows have moved to Delhi for its destination after the order of the District and Sessions court here, the fate of 288 cows still remains uncertain. The Railways which has suffered a huge financial loss on the account is contemplating to file a suit for damages.







Railway police steps up security

Tribune News Service AMBALA, Dec 16  With the Kandahar hijacking anniversary approaching fast, the railway police has stepped up vigil and security at the railway station. The possibility of late last nights railway police efforts to search out a bomb reportedly planted on board Shalimar Express being an exercise to keep the railway police personnel on their toes cannot be ruled out. The train was checked at the Ambala Cantonment railway station on the basis of an information that a bomb had been planted on the train. An even more thorough check was conducted at Jagadhari where the train was held up for about 30 minutes. The railway police had swung into action, on being informed, that there was an explosive on the train and explosive experts, the anti-sabotage team and dog squad were pressed into service to find and diffuse the explosive. To ensure that there was no panic among the passengers, they were not informed about the information regarding the bomb. But, the railway personnel systematically checked the train and at Jagadhari even the undercarriage was subjected to scrutiny. The police took special care in checking the air-conditioned coaches. After a thorough check by the railway police, no explosive was found and the train was permitted to carry on towards its destination. The checking for the bomb on the train was done with the assistance of the local police. In case of any need, we coordinate with others for a variety of aspects, according to police official. He said the railway police was not taking any chances and the security had been beefed up in areas where there is a possibility of intrusion by anti-national elements. The official emphasised that the security by the railway police was tight. We maintain tight security throughout the year and there has been a marked decline in the incidents of drugging and robbery because of our efforts, he said. Incidentally, the security at the oil terminal in Ambala has also been tightened in light of the approaching Kandahar hijacking anniversary. Patrolling has been intensified and a keen watch is being maintained at the access points. An official said that surprise checks were conducted during the night to ensure that there is no let up in the security. Security is a sensitive aspect and we are conscious of the fact regarding maintenance of high degree of security, he added.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,[],2001-08-06 00:00:00,"CHANDIGARH CALLING Strange are the ways of the Chandigarh Housing Board(CHB). While it provides a particular facility to certain allottees, the same facility is denied to other allottees belonging to the same category. A case in point is the faulty design of the LIG flats in Sector 44-C. While the board has provided garages to the first floor and second floor and corner ground floor allottees, the other ground floor allottees are not that lucky. This is a strange sort of discrimination and causes a lot of heartburning and inconvenience to the ground floor allottees, alleges Mr Jagat Mohan Aggarwal, a resident of the sector. The CHB may not rectify all shortcomings in the designs but surely it must provide uniform facilities to the allottees of one particular category, he adds. Posted out The Commandant of the locally based Transport Battalion of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force, Mr A S Chinna, has been posted to the force headquarters at New Delhi. Mr Chinna, who commanded the battalion for over two years, has now been appointed Commandant Staff (Administration). During his tenure here, he was responsible for commissioning a workshop to fabricate bodies of buses and trucks inducted into the ITBP. Meanwhile, the battalions second-in-command, Mr S.S. Harta, has been appointed the officiating commandant, till the time a new commandant is posted here. The battalion is responsible for meeting all transport requirements of the force as well as maintenance and overhaul of vehicles. Road to nowhere To believe the board or ones eyes  this was our dilemma when we came across this board (see picture) near St Kabir School in Sector 26.While the board proclaimed that the route No 3 to Panchkula had been completed over a month ago, in reality the road is far from being complete. Only a part of the road has been completed and it would be quite sometime before it would be fit for use. To avoid confusion the department concerned should either remove the misguiding board or complete the construction work for the sake of credibility. Headless Believe it or not, three of the four Congress organisations have been headless for quite some time. These organisations are the Sewa Dal, Mahila Congress and Youth Congress. Informed sources say the Sewa Dal and the NSUI have been without Presidents. These posts have not been filled for the past one year. The President of the Chandigarh Youth Congress was, however, removed following his appointment as General Secretary of the Chandigarh Territorial Congress, as announced by Mr Pankaj Sharma, observer appointed by the Indian Youth Congress for the membership drive. Insiders say that the Municipal Corporation elections will take place very shortly. Senior leaders feel that the party might suffer in the elections because of the failure of the Congress High Commands to fill these posts. Telecom blues The telecom department blues are not meant for ordinary residents alone. Sometimes, even highly placed officials also have to bear the brunt of faults in the system. These days, it has become a little difficult to get in touch with the UT Home Secretary at his residence phone number. The telephone directory of the UT Administration mentions the residence phone number of Mr R.S. Gujral as 741095. But this number is not-functional. So when you dial, a charming voice on the other side says: Service to the dialled number has been temporarily withdrawn. Given the state of affairs, anyone who wishes to contact Mr Gujral at home must take the trouble of calling up at his UT Secretariat office and taking his actual number from the office people. Khula darbar Frequent khula darbars organised by the Panchkula district administration to redress the grievances of the public appears to have failed as the same complaints continue to pour in repeatedly . Hundreds of civil and criminal complaints throughout the state, which are taken up by the authorities were brought to the notice of the Deputy Commissioner repeatedly but were referred to the authorities of departments concerned for necessary action. However, the administration time and again claims that a total of such complaints, including such of A department were taken up and the rest of B were solved on the spot. Complainants start assembling from far away places early in the morning and some times the complainants have to wait for long hours due to the inadequate arrangements made by the authorities for the massive gathering. In public viewpoint these Khula Darbars have turned into the eye-wash centres for them. A wet experience Nowadays walking in the verandahs outside the decked up shops in the famous Sector 17 piazza can be a wet experience. Not that the roofs of the verandahs leak or the rain troubles you. Instead, water keeps on falling in droplets on ones head due to the airconditioners. These ACs  all of them split type  have been set up by shopkeepers in unique places. These may be 15 feet high just above the signboard of the shop. Iron frames are used to hold up the body of the AC. The cold air is carried from the AC to the inside of the shop through special pipes. The water generated by the ACs in this humidity keeps on dripping in the verandahs and on the head and clothes of the customers. ID gift It is a gift the UHBVN plans to give to its residents on Independence Day. The gift is a portable transformer to attend to any breakdowns which crop up at unearthly hours, putting not only the residents to a lot of inconvenience but also the employees who attend to the complaints. The department officials are very enthusiastic about the new acquisition, the first of its kind in the city. It can supply electricity for four to six hours without interruption. This will help us buy time to attend to the fault without the phone constantly ringing and residents breathing down our necks, an official said. The residents, too, have heaved a sigh of relief with the new arrangement scheduled to take off in a weeks time. And yet the question remains: is a single transformer enough to cater to a city with its ever-increasing boundaries? At least a beginning has been made, says the optimist. Now buffets in open Now you need not worry about money if you wish to have a sumptuous buffet. Many restaurants and sweet shops in Panchkula are now serving the area residents a delightful meal for just about Rs 50. A specific mention in this regard goes to Katani sweet shop and restaurant in Panchkulas Sector 16. The restaurant has been serving buffet to clients for sometime now and it has so won over the customers that every night there are about 15 to 20 people sitting in the open enjoying the economic package which includes at a time (in vegetarian menu) vegetable pulao, shahi paneer, mixed vegetable, curd and green salad. Where on the one hand, the shop is doing well to offer variety at cheap rates, on the other its being noticed also for the fact that its using the adjoining government land to enhance business. A corner shop as it is, the section of land adjoining the shop is being used to lay the buffet. A small gate has also been provided on prime land of Panchkula Municipal Council. Wonder if the government was noticing and if this was an encroachment of sorts! Exhibition An art and design exhibition was organised by students who had recently completed the fashion design course at the Institute of Vocational Courses, being run by the Punjab Ex-servicemen Corporation (PESCO) at Sector 34. The exhibition was inaugurated by Brig K.S. Chandpuri, whom the popular Hindi film Border is based. He appreciated the work done by the students. He also went around the institutions computer laboratory as well as the finance and taxation courses being run for the wards of ex-servicemen. Chairman of PESCO, Maj Gen- U.S. Sidhu, informed the gathering that in the last batch, the institute had trained 92 students in various employment oriented courses. A preparatory course for NDA entrance examination is also being started shortly. Green action plan The Environment Society of India (ESI) and its sister organisations have welcomed the Green Action Plan (GAP) launched by the Chandigarh Administration and the constitution of a task force under the chairmanship of the Deputy Conservator of Forest with members from Horticulture organisations of CPWD, Chandigarh Administration and the Municipal Corporation of Chandigarh. The GAP lays more stress on planting of native trees not only in the sectors but also in the leisure valley. Under this plan, saplings are supplied to the individuals, NGOs and GOs free of cost from the five nurseries of the forest department located around the city. However, a visit to these nurseries reveal that neem and mango (nature plants) saplings are not available. To support the GAP, the ESI has started raising these saplings at its nurseries and will supply 10,000 such plants next year. The GAP has not mentioned the important aspects of plantation. Pits should be of the size of 1x1x1 metres. The soil should be mixed with rotten cowdung in the ratio of 3:1 parts. Planting distance depends upon the spread of the tree. In most cases, the citizens dont remove the plastic bags and the plant do not develop and die. To support this campaign, the ESI has organised a number of workshops in and around the city. Nothing will happen On Thursday, a Chandigarh Tribune team went to the Mani Majra motor market to do a story on encroachment there. While the lenseman was busy taking pictures of the encroachments, the correspondent decided to speak to a scrap dealer who had piled up junk in corridor and was thus blocking the passage. When the correspondent asked him why he had blocked the corridors, he snapped back: Who are you to question me? With a little hesitation, the correspondent introduced himself. The scrap dealer, became somewhat docile. The correspondent rephrased his question and asked: Doesnt the Municipal Corporation people ask you to clear the corridor? The dealer smiled and replied with an air of confidence: Nothing will happen. Sentinel

Pitiable condition of road The condition of the road between Mohalis Furniture Market chowk and the crossing of Sectors 36, 37, 42, 43 is very bad. It is full of potholes and pits. The portion of the road, particularly between Dr Ambedkar Institute of Hotel Management and the above roundabout, is the worst. There is every likelihood road of an accident taking place anytime. This is the second busiest road which connects the residents of Mohali with Chandigarh. The memorial of the late Beant Singh, Chief Minister of Punjab, lies on this road. Big dignitaries and other VIPs visit the place to pay their homage. It is surprising that it has not caught the attention of the authorities. Most of the students take the route as it is the straight road leading to various colleges on Sectors 42 and 11. I hope the authorities will wake up and repair the road at the earliest to redress the grievances of the public. B.S. Kaberwal, Mohali Patiala MC, pull up socks With great pomp and show, the Punjab Government established the Municipal Corporation of Patiala. The office of former Municipal Committee was in Dharampura Bazar and it was easily approachable from all parts of city. The first burden which the corporation put on the people was to construct palatial building for itself near National Sport Complex which is one extreme corner of the city. It became very difficult for the people to approach the corporation office. Crores of rupees were spent and the taxpayers money was wasted. Streetlights were maintained by the Punjab State Electricity Board and the system was working properly. With great fanfare, it was taken up by the corporation in the name of improving streetlight. It handed over the maintenance work to a contractor who employed a few electricians and helpers and purchased a few wooden stairs to climb on the poles. No improvement over the PSEBs work was noticed. The worst was yet to follow. In June 2005, the contractor was removed and the JE corporation started maintaining streetlights. Now the lights on main roads can be seen only. Most of the colonies are in the dark as the JE concerned does not bother about their maintenance. Regarding water supply, the water hardly reaches up to the water meter level. It does not reach the ground floor, what to talk of the first floor. Of course, the authorities do not forget to assure that everything has been done to improve the supply of water. Stray cattle can be seen wondering everywhere. Bazars are very narrow and frequently there are traffic jams, putting the people to great inconvenience. Nothing is done to stop the movements of cars, trucks or three-wheelers by the corporation in the narrow bazars. In most colonies, the roads are 20 feet wide. On both sides, every house has 2.5 feet width unauthorisedly occupied. Thus the colony roads remain only 15 feet wide. The municipality has taken no action. To add to the woes of common man, many people keep their cars in the streets. While there is time limit for constructing houses in PUDA colonies, there is no such provision in colonies like Officer Colony, Malwa Colony, Good Earth Colony, Khakhar Complex, Doctors Enclave etc. People who purchased plots at throwaway prices, do not construct houses. Neither do they maintain these plots properly. The result is that these become dump houses. Two such plots are in front of 81-A in Good Earth Colony. On one side of these plots, a dirty rivulet flow which emanates pungent smell. Just at a distance of half a km from the CMs residence, there is a temple of Lord Shiva and other deities on Kheri Road main market. A local MLC has his property dealing business there. Previously, he was president of Patiala Municipal Committee. Neither the CM of Punjab, nor his wife who is MP from Patiala nor this gentleman MLC bothers. K.K. Bhardwaj Patiala Roadways staff need counselling The write-up titled Booming business for dhabawalas (October 21) has highlighted a problem that has affected a majority of the passengers travelling between Chandigarh and Delhi on Haryana Roadways buses. There is no denying the fact that Haryana has a very good fleet of buses, well furnished and well designed for utmost public comfort and convenience. Yet, its staff, that is conductors and drivers, consist mostly of uncouth and unsophisticated individuals who smoke bidis in running buses, make unscheduled halts and stoppages without even the basic courtesy of informing the passengers about the duration of the halt at a designated stand or a dhaba for their freebies. They non-chalantly leave the bus for 20 to 30 minutes at some remote stop of their choice and disappear. They suddenly re-enter the bus and abruptly move the vehicle without any horn or caution to the passengers waiting for them outside. They, perhaps, treat the passengers as cargo or as chicken and broliers being transported by them. They need some counselling in this regard. It is time the Haryana Road Transport Department took suitable remedial measures to plug the loopholes in its otherwise enviable bus service- perhaps one of the few best in the country to earn the sobriquet, Punjabs envy, Haryanas pride. The journey time between Chandigarh and Delhi can perhaps also be reduced by about half an hour.

Put national security above political interest T HERE is an inborn obsession in the minds of our politicians and bureaucrats that a strong Army does not augur well for the country. No wonder then that all proposals to increase the strength of the Army or equip it with better weaponry are watered down by them. A few years ago, bureaucrats felt that the Rashtriya Rifles (RR) battalions, having the Army manpower, make the Army a bigger force. This led the Fifth Pay Commission to make a recommendation that the RR battalions (36 in all) be disbanded and the internal security which is the responsibility of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) should be given to the CRPF. The commission also said the Army should be used for internal security duties very rarely. Thank God, these battalions were not disbanded, otherwise we would have cut a very sorry figure in combating the militancy in Jammu & Kashmir, especially at such times when the Army is committed on the borders. Why our bureaucracy makes such hollow recommendations when it knows fully well that the CRPF cannot handle the internal security duties independently? Take the recent example of Gujarat, where an Army brigade had to be pulled out from its operational commitment to quell rioting. Mercifully, instead of disbanding the RR battalions, it was decided in April last year that 30 more RR battalions would be raised in the next five years. And to increase their operational effectiveness, this force would be made a regular component of the Army. Admittedly, India would become a much stronger country the day our political pandits stop putting their political interests above countrys national security. Resettlement of ex-servicemen Over 55,000 soldiers, sailors and airmen retire every year; majority of them in their thirties, while most of the officers retire in their early fifties. The age expectancy having gone beyond 65 years, a large number of them have to seek a long second career. Opportunities for the resettlement of ex-servicemen in India are very few and these too are smeared with graft. The Resettlement Directorate of the Ministry of Defence cannot provide suitable jobs to more than one per cent of ex-servicemen who retire every year. Most of the state governments have reserved a percentage of vacancies for ex-servicemen but only a few of them are filled because the ex-soldiers neither have a political clout nor money to pay for the civil jobs. In several cases these jobs are denied to them on one pretext or another. Take the recent example of Punjab, where the Chief Minister had to give directions that the benefit of reserved vacancies would be given to ex-servicemen for the second and subsequent times even when they had availed of this benefit in one service earlier. This benefit was denied to them despite the Punjab Recruitment of Ex-Servicemen Rules, 1983, allowing this concession to them. There are many schemes with the Directorate General Resettlement (DGR) for self-employment of ex-servicemen for which liberal loans are also available from banks. But these schemes generally do not find favour with ex-servicemen because they are not psychologically prepared during their service to handle such projects. Armys reserve manpower In an all-out modern war, even when it is not a prolonged one, the rate of casualties is likely to be very high, thanks to the hi-tech and sophisticated weaponry and equipment. The shortfall in manpower due to casualties has to be made up after every intense battle so that the fighting potential of units and sub-units does not suffer. For this, all armies have their reserves. The reserve, as a rule, should be of the same strength as that of an army. While Pakistan with an army of 5.5 lakh, has a reserve of over 5 lakh, India, with a much larger Army of 1.1 million, has less than 45,000 personnel in reserve. This reserve force is too small to sustain an army in war. What has brought the Indian Army to this unhappy pass? Until the seventies, a jawan served in the Army for seven years, the period called colour service, after which he was transferred to reserve for eight years. During this period he was liable to be recalled to colour service in case of a national emergency. In the late 70s, the colour service was increased from seven to 17 years. This has adversely affected the reserve force of the Army. That our planners have accepted the current system which has almost deprived the Army of its reserve force is unimaginable. This manpower imbalance must be removed if the country wants to fight a war. Pritam Bhullar

From Sushil Manav FATEHABAD:  Pooja and Vinod, a young married couple, were on the brink of divorce as all moves for reconciliation had proved futile. Ultimately, Fateh-Dhwaj  a police-public organisation  came to their rescue and the two are now leading a blissful life. Mukesh Rahi, Naresh Jangra, Deepesh, Girish Wadhwa, Isha Khanna, Gautam Chowdhary and Virender Atwal are some of the local artists who perform very well when it comes to singing. But they were not finding a suitable platform to exhibit their talent. Fateh-Dhwaj provided them the much-needed platform to these artists. It has been organising cultural evenings in the town where these artists get an ample opportunity to exhibit their talent. The sleepy district of Fatehabad was considered to be a dry area as far as cultural activities were concerned. The local people yearned for stage shows and plays. Fateh-Dhwaj has now organised the staging of at least six good plays, including 'Gadhe ki Barat', Kehar Singh ki Maut and Court Marshal. These are only few of the myriad of activities undertaken by Fateh-Dhwaj in the seven months of its inception. The organisation has been carrying on these activities with a view to bringing the police and the public closer. And the organisation seems to have succeeded in its aim. The idea of the forum was first conceived in the mind of the young police chief of this district, Mr Rajbir Deswal. The idea was to have closer ties between the police and the public so that the police may find it easy to combat crimes in society. The basic aim of Fateh-Dhwaj was to fill the chasm between the police and the public and to meet that end, the forum carried out various kinds of activities which included social awareness, helping old and infirm people, settling marital discords, arranging medical and drug de-addiction camps, inculcating a spirit of nationalism in children and organising cultural programmes to provide opportunities to the budding artists of the town. The forum has also been organising cycle rallies under its awareness drive from time to time. Fateh-Dhwaj organised such rallies on the occasion of Diwali to highlight the risks involved in fireworks. Another such rally was organised to make the people aware about the hazards of polythene packs. Fateh-Dhwaj has the DIG (police), Hisar range, as its ex-officio patron. The SP, Fatehabad, is its ex-officio president. A number of local dignitaries, including doctors, advocates, businessmen and educationists, are its active members.

CBI takes U-turn, courtesy Rodrigues

Sanjeev Singh Bariana

Tribune News Service Chandigarh, October 21

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has taken a U-turn in the case of the purchase of sports items at exorbitant rates following a communication from Punjab Governor and UT Administrator Gen S.F. Rodrigues (retd). The report is based on an inquiry regarding the purchase of sports items worth approximately Rs 2 crore without tender and in contravention of rules. The earlier report of the premier investigating agency had sought the registration of a regular case against three top officials for the questionable purchase. Another report had later said it would be difficult to establish that the equipment was purchased at exorbitant rates or undue gain was provided to the supplier by the officer concerned by using their official position. The preliminary report had indicted three top officials, S.K. Sandhu, secretary, sports, I.S. Sandhu, director, and J.P.S. Sidhu, joint director, seeking the registration of a regular case. The case had been highlighted by the Burning Brains Society earlier, which complained to the CBI about the scam in Chandigarhs sports department. Papers available with The Tribune showed that the CBI DIG, on June 3, 2008, recommended the registration of a regular case against the three officers for having abused their official position and favoured the purchase of equipment at highly inflated rates from an Italian company. On the same date, the file with the final recommendation of the DIG was despatched to the CBI director at Delhi for seeking the necessary sanction for prosecution under Section 6-A of the Delhi Special Police Act. Interestingly, General Rodrigues wrote a letter on June 20, 2009, immediately after the file was sent to the director. The letter said, I would like to apprise you of a case of procurement of Techno-Gym, which your agency is looking into. It was a conscious decision of the Administration to procure hi-tech Olympic-standard equipment, in pursuance to our endeavour to establish world-class infrastructure in the city, so as to promote the city as an international hub. Justifying its purchase, the Governors letter fixed the blame on the Sports Authority of India (SAI) and read, As there is lack of accountability in many organisations, the SAI was also written to twice about this brand, but it did not respond. Social activist Hemant Goswami, one of the complainants in the case, stated that claims made in the letter sent by the Punjab Governor are incorrect. The audit was never done by the CAG. The Governor wrote the personal letter to CBI director without any authority. The CBI should reopen the case and investigate the role the Punjab Governor played in subverting the legal process. The CBI file note pointed out, The rates at which fitness equipment have been purchased are highly exorbitant. A report prepared by the office of the DIG dated December 12, 2007, said the purchase from M/s Body Drench India Ltd, Bangalore, without calling any quotations was in gross violation of the general financial rules. Neither was there any budgetary allocation for these items, nor was any need raised on relevant channels. However, despite the decision taken by the DIG after nearly seven months of investigation to register a regular case, the CBI backtracked and decided not to proceed in the case, especially after the letter of the Governor was sent to the CBI director. As a result, the CBI just wrote a letter to the Chandigarh home secretary and asked him to take action as deemed fit at your end and for fixing the responsibility for a missing file related to the purchase of sports equipment worth Rs 59.60 lakh in 2005. There were objections raised by the then finance secretary and the then joint director, Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, but these objections were ignored and the purchases were ultimately made. The report also mentioned that a majority of the equipment were actually being used by only the elite persons of Chandigarh. The lake sports complex is visited only by senior officers of Punjab, Haryana and the UT Administration and the common man does not have access to these premises.","['cbi', 'report', 'chandigarh', 'tribune', 'regular', 'india', 'governor', 'purchase', 'rates', 'case', 'equipment', 'letter', 'director']","The earlier report of the premier investigating agency had sought the registration of a regular case against three top officials for the questionable purchase.

Forms panel to look into objections of residents, traders

Panchkula, August 27

In the face of strong opposition from various quarters, the Panchkula Deputy Commissioner today postponed the decision on implementing the paid parking system and formed a committee to look into the objections of local residents and the Vyapar Mandal.

The committee will be headed by Additional Deputy Commissioner and secretary, Red Cross. The executive officers of HUDA and MC, along with representatives of the Vyapar Mandal, will be its members.

The committee will interact with all parties involved, including the general public, before submitting its report within a month.

Yesterday shopkeepers had observed a strike and staged a protest march against the proposed paid parking system in the town. They raised objections over the scheme, stating that it would affect their business, as a majority of markets were situated inside the sectors, where only local people go for shopping. Moreover, there was a need to improve the parking lots, which fell short of space due to the increase in the number of cars in the town in recent years.

The sequence of events is enough to substantiate that the district administration had to eat humble pie due to its haste in introducing the paid parking system in the town, and that also with the help of the Red Cross Society, which has no business in such issues.

While the DC claimed to have emulated the pattern of Chandigarh to streamline parking in markets, he perhaps forgot to follow the procedure adopted by Chandigarh for such auctions.

In Chandigarh, at least a period of four days is given to the interested parties to prepare for participating in the auctions. In Panchkula, an unusual haste was made in auctioning the parking lots within 24 days of advertising it in the newspapers.

Secondly, no groundwork was carried out to fix a floor price for the auction, leaving the scope of exploitation of situation by the bidders by forming the cartel. That was perhaps the reason behind the price of final auction of Sector 11, which fetch only a little over Rs 18 lakh, while the last auction for a similar market of Sector 35-C in Chandigarh got a whopping sum of Rs 41 lakh in the kitty of the Chandigarh administration.

Lastly, no parking fee is levied in the internal markets of Sectors in Chandigarh.

Meanwhile, sources in the municipal council said while the civic body was asked by the Deputy Commissioner in the monthly meetings to take the responsibility of parking in markets of the town, the land was never transferred to it. HUDA was owning the land and its authorities never got ready to transfer the parking space to the MC despite the fact they verbally agreed to raise no objection over the management of parking by the MC, said the sources.","['parking', 'deputy', 'chandigarh', 'paid', 'tribune', 'objections', 'india', 'markets', 'mc', 'system', 'town', 'committee']","The executive officers of HUDA and MC, along with representatives of the Vyapar Mandal, will be its members.

Rejected candidates resent goof-up

Tribune News Service Panchkula, February 13

Braving inclement weather, candidates who had applied for the post of Hindi translators, today protested outside the office of the Haryana Staff Selection Commission in Sector 2 here after they were turned away on grounds of ""ineligibility"". The Secretary of the Board, Mr P. D. Verma, however, said that most of them did not fulfil the condition laid down for the post. ""Despite the varied qualifications, we are holding interviews for some candidates. The Chairman has said that while we can go ahead with the interviews, a final nod with be given to the selections only after a clarification has been sought from the department concerned,"" he said. Mr Verma explained that they would have to verify the qualifications of the candidates as sought in the advertisement. The candidates, however, made no bones about the casual approach of officers dealing with them. ""We travelled from all over Haryana to be here in such cold only to be rejected by the board. They should have told us in advance about our eligibility,"" said Ramesh Chander, a resident of Jind. Interestingly, the board had sent interview letters to all candidates without the scrutiny of forms. ""We had mentioned our qualifications in the form. If we were not eligible, we should not have got these call letters at all,"" said Satinder Garg from Sirsa. The board seems to have goofed up with call letters sent to all without any scrutiny of forms. The fate of the candidates is decided on the spot which is not only inconvenient but also harrowing for the candidates. ""We invite applications without any documents. We agree that there has been carelessness on the part of the scrutiny officer but it's a policy matter. Usually, there are only a handful of ineligible candidates unlike today when their number exceeds those eligible,"" an official said. The candidates, however, were unwilling to take no. With six- month-old baby in her lap, Nisha Rangara from Sirsa, could not curse the officials enough for forcing her to come all the way to Panchkula and then, shutting the doors on her. There were other women candidates who came with their babies only to go back dejected. Amita Shah from Pinjore, Kavita Gupta from Panchkula, joined the men to raise slogans against the board and its officials in the open, outside the office, as the rain drenched them.

Shopkeepers observe bandh

Claim losses due to closure of market entry points

Tribune News Service Panchkula, February 13

A complete bandh was observed in the Sector 7 market on a call by the Market Welfare Association even as irked shopkeepers blocked traffic for an hour and opened the entry points recently closed by the police in the name of streamlining traffic, here today. In response to the protest, the Deputy Commissioner, Ms Neerja Shekhar, said that a committee to look into the whole scheme to close entry points would be formed. This will comprise people from the business fraternity and also from the Residents Welfare Associations of the city. While the number of accidents has come down due to closure of multiple entry points, we will reconsider these in the light of the objections, she said. Meanwhile, all shops in the market remained closed in protest against the indifferent attitude of the police towards the losses incurred by the business community due to closure of sector entry points. The shopkeepers held a demonstration on the Sector 7 and 8 dividing road hoping to elicit a reaction from the administration. Raising slogans against the police and officials of the district administration, the shopkeepers parked their vehicles at the disputed crossing to block traffic for over an hour. While traffic on the road came to a grinding halt, no policeman reached the spot to take charge of the situation as chaos ruled. School buses were stranded or took wrong turns as did other motorists to circumvent the blockade of the shopkeepers. Agitated with the attitude of the police over business losses suffered following the closure of the crossings, they went on to uproot tiles of the divider. After removing all the tiles which were cemented together to block the entry to Sector 7, the shopkeepers raised another round of slogans at the spot. It was then that the Deputy Chief Minister, Mr Chander Mohan, staying just across the road, stepped out to placate the businessmen. He assured them that there interests would be taken into consideration before taking any decisions and asked a delegation of the shopkeepers to meet the Deputy Commissioner. It was only when the Deputy CM had settled the issue that the SHO of the Sector 5 police station came on the scene and stood like a mute spectator.","['candidates', 'road', 'chandigarh', 'service', 'tribune', 'sector', 'entry', 'india', 'board', 'shopkeepers', 'today', 'ut']","UT all set to release new excise policyTribune News Service Chandigarh, January 13After seeking legal opinion, the Chandigarh Administration is all set to release the Excise Policy for 2007-2008.

Aarti Kapur

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, September 11

Vote-bank politics is again in the limelight. Obviously concerned about the vote bank, Congress Mayor Kamlesh has put a spanner in the Municipal Corporations plans to install water meters in houses of 19,296 consumers in colonies and villages, which are till now paying flat rates.

Though the Finance and Contract Committee (F&CC) of the corporation had passed this agenda and referred it to the House three months ago, yet, being a policy matter, it is still hanging fire as the Mayor is not allowing it to be tabled in the House for discussion.

As per the proposal, which was tabled at the F&CC meeting, the corporation was to install water meters in Mauli Jagran, Vikas Nagar, Indra Colony, EWS houses, rehabilitation colonies, villages and Mani Majra and recover installation charges from consumers in four easy instalments. The total expenditure, likely to be incurred as per the proposal of the department, was approximately Rs 1.5 crore for providing pipe and other material to install the meter.

The agenda clearly stated that the corporation had to install water meters in the city according to the memorandum of agreement signed between the Government of India and the Chandigarh Administration in 2006, under JNNURM projects.

The corporation has two projects, amounting to Rs 20.26 crore and Rs 36.72 crore, for providing SCADA system and tertiary treated water supply lines under the Ministry of Urban Development.

It was discussed that for installing water meters, consumer would have to pay Rs 700 to 800 per house. Officials informed the members that due to non-metering of water supply in the villages and colonies, public health department was unable to recover the operational and maintenance charges.

BSP councillor and member of the F&CC Jatinder Bhatia said it was strange that when the agenda had been referred to the House by the F&CC, why the Mayor was not giving her approval.

MC Additional Commissioner P K Sharma said they had sent the agenda to the Mayor for approval but she had not given green signal to it so far. He said they would again send it to her for allowing it to be tabled in the House.","['fcc', 'house', 'agenda', 'chandigarh', 'rs', 'tribune', 'corporation', 'india', 'mayor', 'water', 'meters', 'install', 'villages']","Mayor puts spanner in water meter planAarti KapurTribune News ServiceChandigarh, September 11Vote-bank politics is again in the limelight.

Technology alone can’t root out corruption,TheTribune: TECHNOLOGICAL solutions are being used to target corruption all over the world.,['Rakesh Kumar'],2019-03-14 06:42:00,"New forms of petty corruption that do not require in-person interaction emerge due to evolving technology. For example, digital bribery, extortion and blackmail are now possible, especially due to authorised and unauthorised access to digital information that corrupt officials may have.

Rakesh Kumar

Associate Professor, Electrical and Computer Engg, University of Illinois

TECHNOLOGICAL solutions are being used to target corruption all over the world. In India, a large amount of effort and resources are being expended into technology-based programmes whose primary goal is to remove corruption. The popular belief is that technological solutions such as government-enabled marketplaces, direct benefit transfer, digitisation of information, and increasing automation in government programmes and services (procurement, taxation, policing, judiciary, etc.) increase transparency, reduce discretion, and eliminate intermediaries, leading to overall reduced corruption. Also, technology is assumed to help with detection, leading to deterrence.

Is corruption actually reduced through the employment of technology? It is important to ask the question because a technology-driven approach to target graft may be crowding out other anti-corruption programmes and institutions.

Corruption requires motivation, justification (or rationalisation), and opportunity. Conventionally, socio-economic factors (inequality, low salaries, closed economy, low media freedom, relatively low level of education etc.) have largely determined motivation and justification for indulging in corruption, while the specifics of delivery of a programme or a service have impacted the opportunity for graft. Does this opportunity always decrease when employing technological solutions?

Consider petty corruption, where low-level officials exploit the asymmetry of information and power for extracting payment, favours or services. Automation and direct delivery of programmes and services can indeed help in reducing such corruption since these officials are circumvented (or exposure to them is minimised). However, the implementation of these technological solutions is often flawed and leads to both residual and, in some cases, new forms of corruption. A recent study showed that direct payment initiated by the Indian government was, in fact, neither direct nor instantaneous. Several new intermediaries — bank staff, private payment agencies and banking correspondents — were needed to enable these payments. Of course, these new intermediaries could increase overall corruption. In another example, a corruption scandal in Afghanistan involved an officer registering SIM cards in subordinates’ names in order to collect their direct money transfers. This new form of graft could undermine any benefit from direct payment.

New forms of petty corruption that do not require in-person interaction also emerge due to evolving technology. For example, digital bribery, extortion and blackmail are now possible, especially due to authorised and unauthorised access to digital information that corrupt officials may have. Similarly, technology often increases the complexity of systems and processes. So, those who understand technology and systems may exploit the asymmetry in corrupt ways. The increased complexity also decreases the possibility of detection, weakening deterrence against corruption.

These arguments apply even to systemic (or endemic) corruption where the bad actors do not act individually but are widespread symptoms of a weak and corrupt organisation or process. In an endemically corrupt system, technology facilitates illicit financial flows. For example, it is easy to use technologies such as bitcoin to hide corruption by transferring money anonymously, untraceably and remotely (without physical presence) from one account to another. These transfers can easily span national boundaries. Similarly, online gambling, massive multiplayer online games and alternative banks that support cryptocurrency exchange and peer-to-peer payments (Revolut, Monzoetc.) can be used for money-laundering. End-to-end encrypted messaging technologies such as Whatsapp and Instagram, and anonymous communication technologies such as Tor and Darknet further facilitate corrupt dealings without fear of detection. While data mining tools are increasingly being used by governments, such tools either have high false positives or high false negatives. Considering privacy laws and the cost and length of court cases in most jurisdictions, these tools are not much of a deterrent.

Technology may be even less effective in reducing ‘grand’ corruption (at the highest levels of the government). When the lawmakers are corrupt, they can create new instruments and policies to support existing corruption and enable its new forms. No amount of technology can serve as a deterrent. Similarly, vested interests can both bend state laws and influence them in such settings. Legal but corrupt activities such as initiating and approving projects to funnel resources to cronies can also go unchecked by technology.

Overall, while some forms of petty or systemic corruption may go down with technology, other forms may continue to thrive, and, in some cases, increase. Besides, while technology impacts vertical corruption (characterised by frequent but small corruption transactions with citizens), horizontal corruption (marked by infrequent but large transactions with commercial or high-worth entities) may largely be unimpacted.

Corruption is a social and economic problem. A multi-pronged approach that targets the entire corruption triangle (motivation, justification and opportunity) through different programmes and institutions is needed. Techno-utopianism that exaggerates the potential impact of technology on reducing corruption is not only wasteful, but also dangerous.","['opportunity', 'programmes', 'petty', 'corrupt', 'direct', 'officials', 'information', 'corruption', 'root', 'forms', 'cant', 'technology']","New forms of petty corruption that do not require in-person interaction emerge due to evolving technology.

Banning tobacco displays may prevent children from buying cigarettes,"TheTribune: LONDON: Removing displays of tobacco products from shops may significantly reduce the number of children buying cigarettes, a study has found.",['Tribune News Service'],2018-09-23 12:21:00,"London

Removing displays of tobacco products from shops may significantly reduce the number of children buying cigarettes, a study has found.

The research, from Imperial College London (ICL) in the UK, assessed survey responses from 18,000 11-15 year olds across England between 2010 and 2016.

The findings suggest tobacco display bans may have an important role in reducing the number of child smokers.

However, the study also suggested that more than two in three child smokers had not been refused cigarettes when they last attempted to buy them—a figure that remained unchanged between 2010-2016.

Majority of child smokers said it was easy to buy cigarettes in shops. This rose slightly from 61 per cent in 2010 to 65 per cent in 2016.

In 2015 the display of cigarettes was banned in all shops in the UK. Before this, 57 per cent of children who smoked regularly bought their cigarettes in shops.

However the latest study, published in the journal Tobacco Control, revealed this fell to 40 per cent by 2016.

""We know that smoking kills one in every two smokers, and that children who smoke are likely to continue smoking throughout their lifetime, seriously increasing their risk of disease,"" said Anthony Laverty, from ICL.

""We also know seeing cigarettes displayed in shops is linked to smoking, especially among children. This research shows that removing displays made tobacco less visible to children, and that fewer of them bought cigarettes there,"" said Laverty.

""Most countries worldwide still allow cigarettes to be advertised and displayed in shops. This research provides evidence that the introduction of display bans will be an effective measure against children smoking -- and could help save them from starting a deadly habit,"" she said.

The researchers analysed data from the Smoking, Drinking and Drug Use Survey—an anonymous questionnaire that quizzes 11-15 year old children across England, and is conducted at schools under exam conditions.

The findings also showed that among the children who smoked, the most common source of cigarettes was from friends, followed by shops.

The team acknowledged that other measures were put in place between 2010-2016 that may have helped reduce smoking rates, such as the ban on cigarette vending machines and higher taxes.

“During this time adult smoking rates have fallen and higher taxes have increased the price of tobacco,” Laverty said.

“All these factors have a role to play, and these findings suggest removing cigarette displays are an important component. Smoking rates fall fastest when complimentary measures are put in place,” she said.

Voters magic worked for Cong There are several factors that have contributed to the sweeping victory of the Congress in the recent elections. People were saturated with blackmailing tactics of the junior partners of the coalition government in the 14th Lok Sabha elections and the Left, which supported the government for the past four years. The Left hindered almost every pragmatic policy that the government contemplated in the interests of the nation. The agenda of economic reforms was not allowed to be taken to its logical conclusion. Though the BJP was not against the Nuclear-Deal ideologically, it opposed the deal for the for the heck of opposing it. Now, it can be safely expected that the BJP would play the role of a constructive Opposition in the future. A vigilant and constructive Opposition is crucial for the success of a democracy. The Congresss decision to fight elections on its own in some states has also resulted in retrieval of several lost constituencies. The middle class and the youth are the biggest factors that turned the tide in favour of the Congress. Over-reaching ambitions of some of the regional leaders of myopic vision also made an average voter aware of his responsibility to put an end to such unrealistic proclamations. The results have turned the table on the regional/smaller parties which wanted to accommodate the Congress on a minimum number of seats in pre-poll parleys but are now clamouring to extend an unsolicited support. The mandate given by the electorate to the Congress demands that the ruling party should not rest on its laurels but strive hard to inventing a new thrust area to take the country to new heights. Lajpat Rai Garg, Chandigarh II It is rightly said that the Congress and the UPA won the battle but the war was actually won by the Indian voters. The mandate given to the Congress by the voters belonging to all segments of the society is evident that the voters care for the stability and progress of the country. The mandate outrightly rejected the regional parties, which tried to blackmail the UPA government for their selfish motives rather than based on policies of development and pro-people programmes. The voters also discarded the derogatory, below the belt mudslinging, personal attacks, using foul language against opponents. People like Narender Modi, Parkash Karat and Varun Gandhi caused damage to their parties than by unscrupulous utterances, filthy language in their poll rallies. Our politicians must learn to behave if they want to survive in the system where there should be no place for communalism and a negative propaganda. In the general elections, the voters have not made any distinction, rather they voted for performers ignoring their affiliations, likings or disliking and for the stability of the government which was not possible without a clear strong mandate. The voters have also rejected the criminals, who were made candidates by various parties in the elections. The people have given a clear message to the government to take up poll reforms and bring the required legislation to debar the entry of the anti-social elements in the elections. The whole election procedure must be overhauled to curb the misuse of this system; right to recall must be brought in to discipline the politicians. A glaring trait of some politicians came to light that they dis not have the courage to call a spade a spade. The Left parties and the BJP never appreciated the reforms and policies of the UPA that were appreciated by the people. In a strong democracy, there must be a powerful Opposition party to act as a watch dog, but our parties have worked as a mad dog. Indian voters have become aware and rational to use their rights judiciously and rationally. Long live our democracy, long live the Indian voter. Capt Amar Jeet Kumar (Retd), Mohali III It has been rightly pointed out that the Congress has it. It were youngsters, urban voters who supported and voted for the right party. In 2004, catchy agenda for the NDA was a feel-good factor. In 2009, people have implemented this factor into action. And this year the voters are actually feeling good to have chosen the right party. Media has played a significant role. Basically, it is the salute of our democracy to the dedicated, committed and honest Manmohan Singh who has been supported by Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. KNS Sodhi, Chandigarh IV Mr Thukral has rightly said that the Congress has it. I would like to mention that Dr Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhis recent triumph has a lot to do with the RTI Act, 2005.

I had personally benefited from the Act as some information sought by me helped clear my name, which was being maligned by certain vested interests.

The letter written by the accused to the principal apologising for her act

Chandigarh, August 26

Close on the heels of 50 students made to stand in the sun for three hours yesterday, another incident of cruelty against students came to light today when a class IX student was slapped repeatedly for not bringing his notebook.

The mother of the student of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Sector 29, here, alleged that her son was beaten by his class teacher today following which he sustained injuries on his face.

Seema Sharma, a resident of Sector 45, said, My son Rishab was slapped repeatedly on his cheek by his computer teacher Pankaj. Rings worn by the teacher left deep bruises on Rishabs face.

Rishabs father is posted in Delhi, but he is studying here because he is undergoing treatment at the PGI for typhoid. Seema said he was tramautised and was refusing to go to the school tomorrow.

She said the teacher was provoked because Rishab had forgotten his notebook at home. After he was beaten, he brought the matter to his English teacher, but she told him to place his handkerchief on his cheek.

It was only later in the day that he called me up, she added. Rishab was not given any first-aid in the school, instead the school authorities were bent on hushing up the matter.

Seema said the matter was brought to the notice of the police and a team headed by additional SHO, Industrial Area police station, visited the school. Principal Simranjit Kaur, however, tried to hush up the matter by saying that the teacher concerned would apologise.

A written apology was tendered by Pankaj. Police sources said they had registered a case as corporal punishment is an offence.

DPI Schools S K Setia said he was aware of the incident but being a Kendriya Vidyalaya, the matter would be dealt by the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan.","['kendriya', 'student', 'chandigarh', 'tribune', 'vidyalaya', 'written', 'india', 'students', 'teacher', 'rishab', 'school', 'matter', 'today']","The mother of the student of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Sector 29, here, alleged that her son was beaten by his class teacher today following which he sustained injuries on his face.

Tormentors snatch womens safety

CCTV grabs show snatchers targeting a woman in Ludhiana. Photo: Inderjeet Verma Ludhiana, July 6

Fridays snatching incident has yet again brought to the fore the vulnerability of women in the city. Due to the rising snatching incidents, gated colonies are mushrooming in the city, with residents confining themselves to the four walls. Although, Kanchan Vasdev, a journalist, fought bravely and foiled the snatching attempt, CCTV grabs belie the tall claims of the police of adequate security arrangements. It was not a stray incident. Several such cases have taken place in the past, with the culprits making away with purses, mobile phones or gold chains. Be it the daughter- in- law of SGPC president Avtar Singh Makkar, a woman judge posted in Nawanshahr, or journalists, including Kanchan Vasdev and Minna Zutshi, the snatchers have not spared anyone. In most of the incidents, women walking alongside roads or travelling by rickshaws were targeted by the snatchers. The snatchers not only leave a victim in agonising pain of injuries, but also traumatise her. Twenty days ago, Upasna Gautam (33) was taking a stroll at Daresi Ground when a youth under the influence of drugs tried to snatch her earrings. She gave him a thrashing and raised the alarm. However, the snatcher managed to escape. Since then, her husband accompanies her to morning walks. How can women be empowered, if they are not safe. The terror of snatching is such that women are scared travelling alone and prefer to be in the company of a male companion while venturing outdoors, said Loveena, a housewife. Police officials are busy pleasing politicians and womens safety figures nowhere on their agenda. As a matter of fact, the officials were all over the place as Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal and his wife and Union Minister for Food Processing Harsimrat Kaur Badal were visiting the city, but as soon as the VIPs left the city, the police officials too vanished. The police have the resources to nab the snatchers, what they lack is intent. If today Deputy CM Sukhbir Badal and DGP Punjab announce a drive against snatchers, the officials will show snatchers running into nakas and getting arrested, said retired professor KBS Sodhi. The drive of the state police against drugs has also boomeranged and led to the rise in drug prices. In order to arrange more money, addicts are committing snatchings, said sources. Senior advocate Dalip Batish said, A majority of snatchings are being committed by the addicts. Even the drive against drug peddling has turned out to be mere eyewash. The police have failed to make any recovery. The so-called peddlers who have been caught with 15 grams to 25 grams of drugs appear to be addicts. The addicts-turned-snatchers get bail in a few weeks and again indulge in criminal activities. The right approach is to conduct the medical test of the addicts and get them admitted to de-addiction centres. Till the time the addicts will not shun drugs, they will not stop snatching. Snatching triggered migrant violence It seems that the police have not learnt any lesson from the December 2009 migrant violence, which led to the death of a migrant and scores of officials injured. Besides, several vehicle and houses were also torched by the agitating migrants in the Dhandari area. Later, it came to light that the violence erupted due to the rising snatching incidents targeting migrants. Due to the violence, the industry had suffered losses running into crores. Snatching incidents July 4: Kanchan Vasdev, a Chandigarh-based journalist, suffered bruises and injuries in the head and ankle when two youths riding a motorcycle tried to snatch her bag. Vasdev caught hold of a snatcher. However, the duo managed to escape. July 4: A bike-borne snatcher took away a purse containing ~24,000 from Kamlesh Gupta while she was going towards Block B, BRS Nagar. July 5: Two juveniles were arrested on Sunday for snatching a mobile phone from Rittu while she was on her way to a shop near Imperial Hotel at 8 pm. July 5: The Jodhewal Basti police have booked Harish Kumar and Gurpreet Singh for snatching a mobile phone from Jagdish Kumar while the latter was going towards Kakowal Road on July 4. The duo is yet to be arrested. July 5: The Jodhewal Basti police have booked Imran Sahota for snatching a mobile phone from Prabhu Dayal at knifepoint on July 3. Fuel shortage Due to the shortage of fuel, the PCR motorcycle fleet is off road. The absence of the bikes is also responsible for the rise in snatching incidents.","['snatchers', 'addicts', 'chandigarh', 'drugs', 'tribune', 'officials', 'violence', 'india', 'snatching', 'women', 'incidents', 'vasdev', 'mobile']","Due to the rising snatching incidents, gated colonies are mushrooming in the city, with residents confining themselves to the four walls.

Ravi S. Singh

Tribune News Service Gurgaon, January 5

The ruling INLD in Haryana today put the entire BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on notice by officially taking the stand that it was keeping its options open to ally with any political party, including the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), for the Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. The Haryana Chief Minister and INLD supremo, Mr Om Prakash Chautala, who was here, said his party would ally with any secular political outfit, except the Congress. Responding to a question, he said the INLD was having talks with various political parties for an alliance for the Uttar Pradesh elections. In what is seen as a shrewd move, he also held out an olive branch to the BJP by saying that its workers and leaders were nationalists. He said so while responding to a question whether he considered the BJP to be also secular. He also chose the occasion to say that India was prepared to give a fitting reply to Pakistan if it dared any misadventure and that his party was ready to strengthen the hands of Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee for the security and integrity of the country. He evaded a direct reply when asked of the number of seats he would contest. He, however, categorically said that his party would contest the elections on its own symbol. He said as the war clouds were hovering over the Indo-Pak border, there was an air of uncertainty about the Uttar Pradesh elections. Incidentally, he is the first NDA leader to publicly express uncertainty about the poll in view of the border tension. According to observers, the statements of Mr Chautala was a move aimed to send mixed signals to the NDA and to parties on the other side of the political spectrum. He remained silent on the subject of the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), headed by his bitter critic, Mr Ajit Singh, Union Agriculture Minister. But the fact that he said that his party was open to an alliance with any political party, including the BSP, is likely to send ripples in the NDA circles. Mr Chautalas statements will be best appreciated if seen in context. This newspaper reported a few days ago that the BSP had asked the INLD to first snap ties with the NDA for an alliance with it. A senior bureaucrat in the Haryana Government had acted as an emissary of Mr Chautala to talk to the former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh and BSP stalwart, Ms Mayawati. A few months back, the same bureaucrat had approached Ms Mayawati. In the first essay, the officer had met with a negative response. This newspaper had also reported a few months back that CPM General Secretary, Harkishan Singh Surjeet had met Mr Chautala in Chandigarh and that Mr Ajay Singh, INLD MP and son of Mr Chautala, was in touch with Mr Akhilesh Yadav and cine star Mr Raj Babbar, leaders of the Samata Party headed by Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav. Mr Ajay Singh is still said to be in touch with Mr Ahiklesh Yadav, Samata Party MP and son of Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav. The INLD is being opposed by Mr Ajit Singh with regard to its inclusion in the possible BJP-RLD tie-up in Uttar Pradesh. The BJP wants to have an alliance with the RLD and has much hope from it in western Uttar Pradesh, considered to be the stronghold of Mr Ajit Singh. In such a situation, the INLD is reportedly finding it difficult to get a decent number of seats. The word decent was used by the Punjab Chief Minister when he espoused the case of the INLD, a couple of months back, during his meeting with Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee. This newspaper had also reported that under pressure from Mr Ajit Singh and the duo of Union Home Minister L.K. Advani and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Rajnath Singh, the BJP was not in a mood to give more than six seats to the INLD.

Twilight memories of bygone days Herbert Read has said very pointedly that sympathy is feeling with while empathy is feeling into. It is good to be sympathetic to others but to identify oneself with the state of mind of a suffering person is a thing apart. This is not an attitude but the bent of mind. In 1951, I was desperate to get a job and, at the same time, to pursue higher studies. My childhood friend, Inder Kumar Sagar, had joined central government service in New Delhi after his Intermediate examination. I wrote to him a letter, after my graduation, to do something for me. He responded promptly and asked me to join him without any loss of time to get admission in university camp college (evening), New Delhi. He told me to bring along my bicycle as I would have to make use of it during daytime to seek a job. I did likewise and roamed about the roads of the Capital for 21 days during the month of September. Ironically, I got admission in M.A. (English) class in New Delhi, but was offered a coveted job in Shimla. Well, the rest is now a part of history that often repeats itself in every age. I recall, now more than ever, how my friend Sagar helped me even when he himself was passing through a period of struggle. Had I known the facts, before leaving Amritsar, I would not have gone there. But it goes to his credit that he helped me in every possible way to tide over my turbulent period of life. This indeed is empathy, that is the product of true emotional impact, and not mere sympathy, which is a passing feeling usually of no consequence. In Shimla, too, I landed myself in trouble, though unwittingly, after some years. I had a good place, called 'Shimla View Cottage', to live in after my marriage. We could have a good view of Shimla from our balcony, particularly at night, when the lights appeared like the stars in the firmament. But to reach Shimla proper, Scandal Point and the Ridge, we had to walk up and down from our house for full one hour. It seemed to be a pleasurable journey for about a year after our marriage. Later it became tiresome to cover the long distance with the baby in arms. So my wife succeeded in convincing me for the change of residence so as to be nearer to the Mall. My efforts for taking on rent a well-located house bore fruit, and we shifted there in the last week of November in 1956. Next day we realised our folly, as the house was bereft of sunshine for the greater part of the day. For about a week we stayed in that house which was well-built and partly furnished, but lacked the warmth of a home. The three of us had the attack of severe bad cold and the 10-month-old baby suffered from fever also. So in desperation I talked to a number of my colleagues to help me in arranging an alternative suitable accommodation. All of them assured me of help but in due course of time. Nothing substantial was visible for some days more. Then one afternoon my friend Wadbhag Singh Gill spotted me standing dejected, in the sunny square, in front of Gorton Castle. I told him my tale of woe. Even before I could wind up, he put his hand in his pocket and handed over a key to me ... ""What's it?"" ""The key of my house in the sunny locality of Sanjauli."" ""What about you and your family?"" ""Nothing to worry about. My wife has gone to Ludhiana and she will remain there during the forthcoming winter months."" ""Is the house big enough that you could also stay with us?"" ""No, I will shift to my friend who lives nearby and he is single."" ""Even then, the inconvenience and all the botheration and the "" He shook hands with me hastily and departed without saying anything in reply. Needless to say that we shifted to that house the same evening and the Sun greeted us the next day with its warm smile, early in the morning. Apart from these two memorable instances, when not mere sympathy but empathy made the path smooth for me, I recall the expression of empathy for me by an object of nature. That weeping willow haunts me still. It was just across the rear window of my residence in Summerhill. In the morning at 9, on my way to the railway station, it took me just two minutes to be near that tree. Invariably, I stopped under its hanging branches and looked up to find a big cluster, like a bower at the top. With a faint smile on my lips I mounted up in a thoughtful mood. It was like saying bye-bye to the companion at home. Those days of bachelorhood in 1954 were quite lonesome at the hill station. In the evening, the weeping willow welcomed me back, with its lingering shadows. As the evening thickened into darkness, I opened a book of poems to regale my mind. In winter season I could see the weeping willow, through the windowpanes, heavily laden with snow. In moonshine the hoary spectacle appeared uncanny and weird. When a strong wind wafted through its hanging branches, there was a good shower of particles of snow on the ground. The night, of course, lingered on in fitful wakefulness and I was aware of the presence of someone who could be with me in the hour of need. At times I recited aloud, within the earshot of the willow tree, an Urdu couplet ... Umar kaise kategi 'Saif' yahan Raat kat-ti nazar nahin aati. Still the day dawned as usual and the willow tree bade me good morning as ever.  N .S Tasneem","['friend', 'house', 'empathy', 'evening', 'day', 'chandigarh', 'willow', 'tribune', 'india', 'good', 'days', 'weeping', 'shimla']","I did likewise and roamed about the roads of the Capital for 21 days during the month of September.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,[],2003-05-08 00:00:00,"BUSINESS MARKET SPOTLIGHT  Sec-26 Madhya Marg

Superior quality furniture is the hallmark of Sector 26 market

Sanjay Sharma M alaysian furniture has made an entry into Chandigarh with a bang, courtesy the ban on tree felling in the country and the opening up of the market to global players. Brands like Sent In and THS have a collection of Malaysian wooden wares that bring traditional Indian furniture in focus for the changing trends. A market with a massive volume and few customers used to be once a supplier to corporate and government customers, and is known for the collection of quality products in Himachal, Haryana and Punjab. Competing with the Malaysian furniture is Salvan Furnitures that has an Indian collection, giving Malaysian furniture a run for money on the strength of engravings. Divided between two parts along the Madhya Marg, the market has 60 odd shops. Of these, between 20 to 22 are that of the building material. One shopkeeper says it is not a very popular market in the sense that a customer reaches here for everything but does so only when he has exhausted his efforts to find a product. The material here is costlier than in other markets due to a superior quality of products available here. Though the rich people of Himachal like to shop here, the general price-sensitive customer of the state avoids this market. Chandigarh Territorial Congress Committee leader B. B. Bahls Hotel President is one of the attractions of the market. Apart from attracting politicians of the Congress from the entire region, it has a coffee shop where food is available round-the-clock. Goel Electric Company, Khanna Watches and Star Plywood are well known names of the market. The market is easily recognisable from Peepal trees seen in large numbers from the Madhya Marg. The market seems to be growing in the shade of these trees which seem to be rarely trimmed. Shopkeepers here dare not do so due to a sense of piety attached to the tree amongst Hindus. Due to an attraction of the Madhya Marg, popular eating joints like Nathus opened their shop here but had to close down as the market does not attract a large number of visitors. The number of visitors is high only for those who come to their offices on the first and second floors. But their daily needs seem to be met by pantries set up in government and corporate offices. Despite the presence of Pizza Hut in the market, the small needs of a large number of employees of corporate and government offices are met by street vendors who serve tea and sell fruits. The market was originally planned to have shops on the ground floor, offices on the first and flats on the top floor. But commercial pressure has led to the disappearance of flats with not a single person using it for residential purposes. The market started coming up after a few of the plots in it were auctioned in the early seventies. Apparently realising the potential of fetching a high value for the plots here, the Chandigarh Administration did not auction all these plots here in one go but sold them in phases. Mr Bahl remembers he bought the plot in 1974 at a price of Rs 1.4 lakh but it took him around 10 years to build the hotel. THS is amongst a chain of Zakaria export houses from Muradabad where Malaysian furniture has found its way in the various sections of each living activity. The store has a collection of wares needed for each living activity. It has a mix of imported and domestic products. The group which had been in the export business for decades has now tried to introduce the Indian customer to the quality of Indian products exported. The Sent In has an entire range of furniture imported from Malaysia along with decorative pieces made of non-wood material. The products here hold your attention for the gloss the material has. Corporate offices and an LML dealer shop is there in the market to make it a multi-activity one. Though the building material dealers here are thought to be of wholesale scale, they are also in retailing. Problems Parking area is short and mismanaged. Shopkeepers want police to enforce parking system along with segregation of cycles, four-wheelers and rehris.

The lighting arrangement in the market is inadequate. A few of street lights in the market are not functioning.

Though there are toilets for shopkeepers in the market, a common customer does not have the facility of a public toilet.

The Peepal trees are unkempt as the Horticulture Department seems to have forgotten trimming them.

The parking area has not been carpeted for 15 years.

The pattern of tiles in the verandah is not symmetrical as the old tiles fitted by the government have not been replaced.

The market has been witnessing waterlogging during the monsoon.

Backlane of the market has been encroached upon by certain people.

Though the recarpeting of the back lane has been taken up, not much headway has been made.

The beautification of the market has not been attended to.

There are no utility shops in the market.

Cleanliness of the market seems not to have been ever attempted.

Arup Chanda

Tribune News Service Chennai, December 31

Whether its Punjab or Haryana men rule the roost. The rule never changed even in a south Indian state like Tamil Nadu till tsunami happened. Post tsunami there has been a sea change in all the costal areas of the state. In post-tsunami Tamil Nadu, gender roles are getting redrawn: while it was the men who brought in the money earlier, the women have now taken over, silently and swiftly rebuilding livelihoods. Visit any of the coastal villages in this state that are tsunami signposts - Colachel in Kanyakumari, Akkaraipettai or Seruthur in Nagapattinam, Devanampattinam, the largest fishing village of India in Cuddalore or Srinivasapuram in this state Capital of Tamil Nadu. The scene is the same. You will see the men gambling and starting to drink from noon. In contrary, women could be seen pitching up their temporary shelters or if they had been lucky to shift to permanent houses making it ready, ensuring that the children go to school. For the first time in the history of Tamil Nadu have the women run self-help groups (SHGs) proved their mettle as comprehensively as in post-tsunami reconstruction. This despite the fact that according to a Rural Development Department statistics, 37,385 SHG members all over Tamil Nadu have been directly affected by the tsunami and 831 of them killed. It was a wonder for many that just two weeks after the tsunami, as many as five SHGs became operational in Colachel in Kanyakumari district, some of them with only a handful of members, but each with a clearly defined task. While a SHG lobbied with aid-givers and NGOs in getting the best possible shelter arrangements, another ran the community kitchen while one counselled distraught survivors and cajoled them out of depression. In Nagapattinam, the worst hit in mainland India with 6065 dead, SHGs have helped communities tide over local frictions and traditional rivalry with neighbouring villages over fishing rights. With the male-dominated panchayat system dysfunctional, the women now run a de facto panchayat. Women have been working hard and even bagging export orders to the tune of lakhs of rupees. Even greeting cards drawn by orphaned children are in great demand. Devanampattinanm in Cuddalore which had been infamous some of the bloodiest feuds with neighbouring villages is now a model as far as law and order is concerned. Said Cuddalore District Collector Gagandeep Singh Bedi, Earlier fights among fishermen over small things were quite common. After tsunami the rate of crime has gone down considerably. With the loss of livelihood pushing the men into an alcoholic stupor, the women are putting together the pieces. Nearly eight SHGs had been operational in two streets alone, doing everything from repairing and painting boats to making fish pickle. Ever since tsunami happened our men had not been to the sea. For two months it was my earnings that fed our children and men, said Pushpa, who lost a son to the sea. Said Mariyayee (80) at Srinivasapuram here, Earlier fishing community was always run by women but Dubai money spoilt community dynamics. Now it is back to us, at least after this I hope our men will beat us up less. According to Nagapatti-nam Collector Dr J. Radhakrishnan, We are lining up revolving funds and capacity-building initiatives for SHGs. TADCO has also sanctioned a Rs 50-lakh discretionary fund and several microfinancing options are being explored. We are very particular about community participation in disaster recuperation.","['chandigarh', 'tsunami', 'tribune', 'sea', 'india', 'state', 'tamil', 'community', 'nadu', 'shgs', 'women', 'villages', 'men']","One year post tsunami, its women power in TNArup ChandaTribune News Service Chennai, December 31Whether its Punjab or Haryana men rule the roost.

Sound bytes of success For that elusive call, telemarketeers, who are mostly women, are shoved ahead to rummage through irate, moody, wolfish and some Romeoish customers with zest and élan. Such tolerance! It makes us wonder who the proverbial weaker sex is, writes Peeyush Agnihotri Hasdi ne side mang laayi Asi sarak hawale keeti (Smilingly she asked for a pass on the road, enamoured I surrendered the whole highway.) P ROFOUND apologies for starting off with a plagiarised slogan scrawled at the rear of a truck. But why just blame an illiterate truck driver for his creative slogan when this is what is happening the world over. After deploying top models to sell products ranging from lollipops to limousines, the corporate world is now relying heavily on female voices to sell. Yes, thanks largely to high urban teledensity, the nightingale-throated telemarketers are invading homes and offices. And they are producing results. An example: Women marketers at Nike implemented a dialogue campaign through 800 phone lines to answer customer queries. The men pooh-poohed and then watched in amazement as the sales boomed. No wonder most call centres, PR agencies and telemarketing companies are hiring women professionals. ""Its more of a trend now. Men like to listen and hear female voice the world over. It strokes them. Women like to hear it because they identify with the voice and are more comfortable with the call. A win-win situation, irrespective of the clients gender,"" former CEO of a call centre says. In customer interaction, women score better than men. ""Yes, I agree men tend to listen to women more carefully as women approach with a particular concept. They give a positive comfort level in communication that is pleasing. In public relations, women professionals have the abilities of communication, presentation, understanding, personality, and, above all, feedback analysis. These attributes make them more successful than male counterparts,"" avers Monita Sharma, vice-president of media relations and client servicing with Mutual PR, a public relation company. Most men tend to flaunt a king-size ego if they find girls asking for a favour (read please-buy-a- product). Noted anti-feminist author Warren Farrell has been actually quoted as saying ""being with engaging young women is like being an alcoholic and seeing drinks all around."" For some men a phone call has the same inebriating effect. ""Such calls make a man feel important. It soothes him. That is why the success rate of women telemarketers is high. No doubt, women are kinder, gentler and speak softly but then this female attractiveness card should not be played to extract an unfair advantage. This undue exploitation should stop,"" opines J.M. Jerath, Professor, Department of Psychology, PU. The very word telemarketer instantly draws jeers and contempt from everyone not associated with the profession. Some call them privacy-invaders while others term them mithi-churi (sugar-coated knife), primarily because sweet voices waste your time and seek your money. Given that 98 per cent of 1.78 million responding to a recent online survey said telemarketing calls made them angry, it perhaps makes more sense to have a calming voice as a salesperson. The foremost reason for a lot of women being employed as telemarketers is because sending a product message across through a woman is an age-old marketing tool, according to Sanjeev Kumar, HRD manager, e3R, a call-centre. ""They are good at starting discussions. Their mere presence and the gender-benefit make them clinch a sale-call conveniently. Even if a customer has to say no, hell say so politely to a female telemarketer. Sometimes, they play the role of a steam-valve and clients actually start discussing their personal problems on how they have been jobless or how his girlfriend ditched him evincing a oh-so-sorry or never-mind-thats-how-life-is kind of responses from the agents,"" the manager says. Consumers see them as a shoulder to lean on. Most agencies function late till night. Add to it, a guy trying to act fresh on the other end of the line and security issues crop up. Though the agencies and call centres have pick-up-with-doorbells and drop-at-home-door cabs, still the idea of working at the dead of the night is scary. ""This is the primary reason why a lot of women do not prefer such kind of jobs in first place. It is a deterrent. Being modern, they may have the courage to face such professional hazards yet chances are their family members may not allow night jobs. I feel people tend to rely on them more as they perceive that a woman telemarketer is less likely to commit a fraud. They enjoy more credibility,"" says Anuj Mahajan, director, KallDesk, a Chandigarh-based call centre. Anuj says women have the ESP to know when the situation begins slipping out of hand and then they instantly say goodbye, thank you and hang up. ""On the other hand, if the call has a sale potential but the customer is a kind of mushy, the receiver is promptly handed over to the floor supervisor,"" he says. ""Why just the outside world. Even offices have some wolfish colleagues and there have been instances when agents have been fired on complaints. For women, we hold induction workshops and programmes on dealing with this menace,"" Sanjeev says. Any woman telemarketer will have interesting anecdotes to narrate on how a few male would-be clients literally freaked out. ""One of them dragged on the conversation and then started asking my name, address and whether I was free that evening,"" discloses a credit-card telemarketer almost suppressing a giggle. Agrees Abha, Head, Operations, at a call centre, ""There was a case wherein a guy on the other end of the line said that he liked the voice and wanted to have the e-mail id etc. of the agent. Such things do keep on happening but the rate of occurrence is just once or twice a week. Maybe less. The advantage is that with such a call coming through a phones receiver, the telemarketer can hang up at will,"" she says. Then what does a telemarketer do? ""Basically it all depends on how you react. It is always better to handle such situation with a very positive frame of mind making things clear during the first interaction. After all, its a matter of ones attitude toward such situation,"" opines Monita. According to Private Citizen, Inc., telemarketers place 148 million junk calls a day. In the USA, nearly 100 million Americans (one out of three) purchase goods and services over the phone each year. Paradoxically, though half of the Californians recently polled said interruptions from telemarketers irked them more than sitting in traffic, doing their taxes, or waiting in a queue. It shouldnt, however, be forgotten that telemarketing industry for consumer sales is expected to grow 8 per cent annually. The hitch is that behind one call that matures, many go waste. And where is that one call is the question that rankles the mind of the corporate czars. For that elusive call, telemarketers, who are mostly women, are shoved ahead to rummage through irate, moody, wolfish and some Romeoish customers with zest and `E9lan. Such tolerance. Makes us wonder who the proverbial weaker sex is.

Blame game begins

Tribune News Service Chandigarh, April 29

The monthly meeting of the Municipal Corporation here today was nothing more than a political drama. The recent demolitions of religious structures in Dadu Majra was the issue under discussion. The ruling group of the Congress exchanged animated discussions with the councillors of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Shiromani Akali Dal over who was to blame for the silence during the ant-encroachment drive in Dadu Majra in which 14 religious structures were demolished on Tuesday. Kamla Sharma, a BJP councillor and a former Mayor, led the 'shouting brigade' which blamed the Congress for total inaction in stopping the demolition of the religious structures. She was supported by Mrs Harjinder Kaur, a councillor of SAD, and Mr Rajesh Gupta of the BJP. Mrs Sharma said that ""the Congress councillors, instead of taking the responsibility of leading a protest against the action of the UT Administration and the Municipal Corporation, had run away to Delhi."" It is worth pointing out that while the demolition was in progress in Dadu Majra, a number of influential Congress councillors were in Delhi doing rounds of senior leaders seeking a change in the presidentship of the local Congress. Mr Subhash Chawla, a former Mayor, took control of the House proceedings and replied back 'strongly', saying that "" we were in Delhi. You(BJP and SAD) were in the city. Why didn't you protest? These utterances are nothing more than creating a political sensation to influence the common man"". He was supported by Mr H.S.Lucky. Mr Chawla also lashed out at the Opposition, saying: ""You provoke us as much as you can but the House will not employ marshals to take you out because you are looking for political mileage out of the meeting"". Mrs Shyama Negi, Congress councillor from Dadu Majra area, said: ""It is sad that none of the voices who are making a noise now actually came on the spot when the demolitions were being carried out. I was there without support from any party"". Leaving aside drama of the political parties, the House witnessed exchange of hot words between two senior nominated members. Mr P.C.Sanghi made an unpleasant remark when the draft of the model law for municipalities was being discussed by Mr K.S.Raju. This infuriated Mr Raju and the House witnessed heated exchanges. The issue was postponed. One important issue pertained to questions over propriety of the trip of Mrs Kamlesh, a former Mayor, to Hyderabad last year along with her husband. Mr Sanghi sought details of expenditure. The corporation made certain replies. The issue, however, could not be discussed because Mr Sanghi was himself not present in the House. Talking to The Tribune later, he said he will frame fresh questions and take up the issue once again.","['house', 'mrs', 'majra', 'chandigarh', 'dadu', 'tribune', 'issue', 'structures', 'india', 'political', 'mr', 'congress', 'sad']","COMMUNITY Furore over demolitions in MC meetingBlame game beginsTribune News Service Chandigarh, April 29The monthly meeting of the Municipal Corporation here today was nothing more than a political drama.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,[],2001-12-01 00:00:00,"Where creativity was the winner

Tribune News Service Chandigarh, November 30

For everyone gathered in the Leisure Valley today, it was a virtual flight on the wings of joy. As the carnival spirit picked up from the colourful balloons released by the UT Administrator, Lt Gen (retd) J.F.R. Jacob, to mark the beginning of the three-day fest today, it soared high ....too high to be trapped.



In the series of close to 20 floats, the float executed by students of the Government College of Arts, Sector 10, was adjudged the best today. The idea of fun mobikes (in various shapes like beatles, tortoise etc) embarked upon by the creative students was appreciated highly. The float of Government Home Science College which denounced terrorist activities also won accolades and was rewarded today. A special mention in the list of creative stalls was made of the fairyland stall conceived by Government Home Science College. Perched in the middle of the Leisure Valley, this stall had kids of Chaitanya School dressed up as fairies, holding magic wands. General Jacob made a special note of the kites in the stall which had various kites on the display. He also flew a kite himself. This day seemed like the real revellers day out in the Valley, which was all done up on the fairyland theme. And for once, everything happening around seemed quite in consonance with the theme chosen for the carnival by the UT Administration. With no holds barred on anyones participation in anything, creativity sure was the king today. So while on the one hand the high-flying Punjab Governor surprised the gathering with his gesture of painting a tree, on the other the charming little inmates of Government Institute for the Mentally Retarded, Sector 32, impressed the passers by with their dance on the hit Haryanavi number Mane payal dila de re o nandi ke veera. As joint director of the Institute, Dr B.S. Chavan, watched the dancing kids with an obvious apprehension, the kids succeeded in dispelling his doubts about them. They looked infirm, but they looked indomitable. As their music teacher Pushpa told us: If only we pay attention to them, they can become one among us. Perhaps interaction with normal kids during the carnival does the mentally challenged kids some good. Balancing fun and creativity, the carnival offered the best it could. One could witness a sea of children from various schools participating in a host of contests like on the spot painting, mask making, clay modelling, mat making and hands on puzzles... There was also room for traffic in the carnival, with traffic police personnel educating children on rules and regulations. Camel rides, kite exhibition were other highlights. Yet another eye catcher was the play titled Seth Kallumal ki kahani staged by slum kids of Janata Colony. Directed by Ravi and Vijay, the play made a strong social statement. Even as many UT Administration officials were busy following the Governor around during the festival, visitors to the valley seemed to be least interested in official attention. They made themselves comfortable around the mini Rock Garden created by Nek Chand at the carnival venue. Another favourite spot for the day was the Laxman jhoola, apart from the amusement corner, dotted with adventurous rides. Not to miss the nostalgia created by naqaals, saperas, behrupias, stick walkers and other charmers. Colour to the already glittering venue was added by the various floats conceived by the government colleges of the city, as also by some societies like the Environmental Society of India, the Kalasagar, and the migrants from Multan area. The procession of these floats, led by the hop on hop off bus, was also flagged off by General Jacob today. On the gourmet front, it was the carnival bistro  the village rasoi taking care of the visitors. The counters, laid out by CITCOs Chandigarh Institute of Hotel Management and the Food Crafts Institute, along with those by Chop Sticks 2, attracted the maximum rush. The rush at food joints was matched by the rush at Friends of Childrens corner where Centre for Education and Voluntary Action (CEVA) had arranged puzzles which forced children and their parents to churn their brains in a big way. At the carnival stage, the various folk dances of Himachal Pradesh (nati, beehu), Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana (ghoomer, bangra and giddha) kept the spirit going. In this entire razzmatazz, one silent and peaceful corner was that of the senior citizens. They kept busy reciting poetry and painting on the canvas.

Needed: a common engg entrance test D URING the last three years, more than 100 coaching centres, mostly giving coaching to the students for IITJEE examination, have come up in Chandigarh alone. Every centre is claiming to have met roaring success, exhibiting the names, ranks and even photographs of successful students in newspapers. It is also said that many centres approach successful students, shower them with gifts and make them sign a declaration that they had consulted those centres for coaching purposes. This year, a popular centre of Delhi, now having branches all over India, issued a full four-page advertisement in newspapers, showing the complete list of students who accounted for almost 50 per cent of the total number of successful candidates. A close scrutiny revealed that most of them were those who had appeared in the mock test series concluded by that centre just before the actual examination. What the advertisement would have cost the centre can well be imagined. And such big amounts can be spent only when the aspirants are made to pay thousands of rupees for subjectwise coaching. Students aspiring for admission to engineering colleges are, however, a confused lot. They have to appear in scores of entrance tests conducted by various organisations. These tests include IITJEE, AIEEE, CEET, PU-CET, PTU CET, SLIET, LEET, EET DCE and many others. They have to buy costly prospectuses, apply, deposit hefty fees, appear and deposit admission fee to all these institutes. They take all examinations because they dont want to take chances. There are counselling sessions and engineering branches are allotted. The same students, who have secured good marks, get selected in many institutes while many others are deprived of admission due to this multi-admission of a few top students. Then, the selected students choose their institutes and disciplines leaving other institutes and get refunded part-fee of their deposit. This leaves a few seats vacant and those in the waiting list are called for selection. Even those who were selected earlier are also called for re-counselling for upgradation of their branch. The process continues, the parents losing their hard-earned money, the students wasting their valuable time and the institutes accumulating lots of money from the students who left, on account of paid seats, from donations and so on. It seems as if a sort of education mafia has started working with all of us having become victims of it. Isnt it time that a single engineering test like, say, All-India Engineering Entrance test (AIEET) is conducted and the students asked to submit their preferences and admitted to the institute nearest to their choice on the basis of the ranks attained by them? Naturally, the toppers will get admitted to IITs, next one to NITs, next lot to DCE, PEC, Thapar, MAHE and so on. If a single all-India engineering entrance test is held, a student will get the institute and engineering branch according to his performance and merit will prevail eradicating this complex web of multiple tests, applications, counselling, multiple admissions, waiting lists and so on. Lots of countrys time and money will be saved by this single step. The Union Ministry of Human Resource Development should look into this matter with the attention it deserves. JAGVIR GOYAL , Chandigarh Teachers Day When Teachers Day was first observed on September 5, 1962,to mark the birth anniversary of our former President Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, it was hoped that this official gesture would usher in a new era for the teaching community and revive the lost glory of the profession. Since then, the teachers, by and large, have deluded themselves into a celebration of sorts on September 5. The community has led itself into a ritual by organising functions. Some habitual ones go through the exhortations and harangues, eat the free institutional lunch and thank heaven! On the same day, teachers organisations in various parts of the country boycott the functions to highlight the problems they are facing, their long list of demands and the shortcomings in the system. This year, too, Teachers Day was no exception. The teaching profession is regarded as the devalued professions in the country today. There is a general impression that only rejects in competitive examinations take up teaching. In ancient India, the guru used to be compared with the Creator. The pupil was his minds child. The return to the wisdom of the rishis was a realistic act. The Vedas and the Upanishads have given the teacher a place of honour and distinction. Today, however, teaching and cheating are often considered synonymous. The teacher has lost his grace. The pupil has lost his opportunity. Society has lost the capacity to be grateful. Why do we celebrate Teachers Day at all when the teachers have lost their value and are not revered anymore? Dr Radhakrishnan was a true, honest and uncompromising teacher, versed in modernity and tradition. He was open to the free winds of modernity blowing around him from all sides. He taught us, among other things, that when the vision fades, the habitual awareness of this world returns. One is not self-existent. One is dependent on a larger nexus, which the teacher must identify and explain. To recover the inner poise is the aim of education. In the ultimate analysis, a teacher is a creator and creation is mans lonely attempt to know his own strange and secret soul  and its real vocation. We have imprisoned Dr Radhakrishnan at many places in marble but he keeps on leaping back to life. Let us learn a little about ourselves from him. He will thrill us with ideas and fortify us with a sense of duty. Then practice will redeem theory. Teachers, performing their duties, will attain their rights. If human values go wrong, nothing in the world can ever go right. K.M. VASHISHT , Mansa Ban narcotics Chemists and druggists are selling narcotic drugs in Patiala, the city of our Chief Minister, Capt. Amarinder Singh. They sell tablets, capsules, injections and liquid medicines in the form of cough syrups. Even though they are injurious to health, they are available in the market and people buy them. What is of particular concern is that these drugs are a great threat to both present and future generations. Youth have become the worst victims of these drugs. Surprisingly, in the absence of strict enforcement of the rules by the authorities concerned, licences are obtained very easily by these chemists, most of whom do not have even the prescribed qualifications. Some have, no doubt, completed pharmacy degree, but they run the business on fake licence. Some of them, who have completed just Class VIII or IX, dont know how to talk to consumers. Licenses issued to such people should be cancelled forthwith in the larger interest of the youth and other sections who have become victims of this menace. Those drug Inspectors who are hand in gloves with these fake chemists should be brought to book. These inspectors dont seem to object to the sale of spurious drugs since they get their monthly hafta from the chemists. GURBACHAN SINGH , Asian Athlete , Patiala

"Russian retailers, hotels emerge as World Cup winners","TheTribune: MOSCOW: The World Cup has captivated host Russia for a month, proving a boon for the brewing and hotel industries while dampening spending on some expensive items and curbing trading on financial markets.",['Tribune News Service'],2018-07-13 19:59:00,"Moscow, July 13

The World Cup has captivated host Russia for a month, proving a boon for the brewing and hotel industries while dampening spending on some expensive items and curbing trading on financial markets.

As well as the usual staples of the soccer fan—beer and snacks—the tournament also spurred domestic demand for loans for electronic appliances, primarily TV sets and smartphones.

Meanwhile, Russian car dealers will probably welcome the end of the party on Sunday after sales slowed last month.

Economists have played down the direct economic impact from the World Cup, predicting it would be marginal and unevenly spread.

That tends to fit the pattern of other countries that have hosted major sports events—a brief bounce but not enough to make a lasting impact on an economy.

The tournament, which kicked off on June 14 and ends when France play Croatia in Sunday’s final, attracted more than 700,000 foreign fans to Russia, who packed the streets of the 11 host cities together with locals.

Moscow saw a 60 per cent increase in foreign tourists, bringing the overall number of visitors to the Russian capital during the World Cup to 3 million people, said Nikolai Gulyaev, head of Moscow’s sport and tourism department, said.

All those fans needed to be housed and kept refreshed.

Booking.com warned 74 per cent of properties in St. Petersburg and Moscow have been booked for the World Cup final weekend. Booking.com’s website gave no such warning on availability for next weekend.

In the stadiums, Russian fans were the main spenders, having laid out $12 million over the first four weeks of the tournament, Visa said on Friday.

“Sales of beer, non-alcoholic beverages and snacks have visibly increased in the first two weeks of the World Cup,” said the Perekrestok supermarket chain, part of Russia’s largest retailer X5 Retail Group.

In host cities, some of which have never seen so many tourists, fans swarmed to cafes and bars, draining beer supplies to alarmingly low levels.

PLANES AND SCREENS

Kviku, an online retail lending company, said the number of its customers rose more than a quarter over the past month as people took out loans to buy flights to World Cup host cities.

It also saw increased demand for loans for devices on which to watch matches, Kviku added.

Sales of TV sets and smartphones had already posted a 20 percent increase in May-June compared with a year ago, Russia’s leading electrical goods retailer M.Video-Eldorado said.

“Soccer is such a desire for most active fans that it prompts them to go for extra borrowing,” said Nikita Lomakin, the CEO of Kviku.

Purchases of World Cup-related merchandise also picked up after Russia’s surprising progress to the last eight of the tournament, according to Russia’s leading classified ads platform Avito.

Some Russians appear to have opted to stay at home to watch the matches on television rather than take a holiday.

The number of Russians who had no summer travel plans this year rose to 23 percent from 7 percent seen in 2016, a survey by Russia’s research centre Romir showed.

COMPETING FOR ATTENTION

Other businesses in Russia were less excited about the tournament. New car sales growth slowed in June to 11 percent from 18 percent a month earlier, with analysts blaming the World Cup as the factor that distracted buyers.

Indeed, some measures announced while Russians were caught up in the World Cup excitement, such as increases in sales tax and the retirement age could have a more enduring effect on the economy.

While retailers and hoteliers tot up the takings from the month, it will take time to study the overall World Cup effect after it filters into official data.

“This is the question of no less than one year or maybe more,” said Shlomo Weber, rector of the prominent New Economic School.

On the financial markets, activity fell on all sections of the Moscow Exchange apart from the bond platform as traders turned their focus to live action.

And even though its economic benefits are debateable, the World Cup certainly lifted spirits.

“The World Cup is a good thing but not always for trade, more for the mood,” the exchange’s CEO Alexander Afanasyev said. — Reuters","['month', 'emerge', 'sales', 'hotels', 'world', 'russias', 'fans', 'russians', 'retailers', 'host', 'russian', 'tournament', 'cup', 'winners']","Economists have played down the direct economic impact from the World Cup, predicting it would be marginal and unevenly spread.

Circumstantial evidence led to verdict

Rajay Deep

Tribune News Service Bathinda, May 5

The sensational murder case, in which a woman and her paramour were served double life sentence by Additional District and Sessions Judge RS Rai here yesterday, was argued on the basis of circumstantial evidence in the absence of eyewitnesses. The woman had first poisoned her husband to death and later her two children also met with the same fate in 2005. The life term will run one after the other and not concurrently, amounting to 40 years in jail along with a fine of Rs 20,000 each. Confirming this, Deputy District Attorney IS Kingra said there was no one else other than the woman with access to the children at the time they were administered poison. According to details collected, Manpreet Kaur was married to Harjeet Singh of Jaga Ram Tirath and the couple had two sons. However, after some time, Manpreet developed illicit relations with her husbands cousin Binder Singh. Finding Harjeet a hurdle in their relationship, both conspired to kill him. Manpreet mixed some poison in his food after consuming which he died. Assuming it to be a case of natural death, no family member suspected any foul play and cremated the body without a postmortem examination. On the third day after Harjeets cremation, Manpreet herself floated a proposal to remarry. But her in-laws denied apprehending that the fate of her two sons, one eight-year-old and the other two-year-old, would be at stake. Irked over it, she started finding her children to be another hurdle in her marriage. Later, both conspired to kill the children and adopted the same modus operandi. However, in his dying declaration, the elder child said their health deteriorated after they consumed food given by their mother.Family members rushed the children to a private hospital in Mansa from where they were referred to the Mansa Civil Hospital. But both died on the way. On the statement of the family members, the Talwandi Sabo Police clubbed both cases of killing in one FIR and booked Manpreet, her two sisters, Kanta and Anita, and Binder for killing Harjeet and his two sons. The viscera report too confirmed that the death was caused by poisoning thus ruling out diarrhea or natural food poisoning as the cause. Meanwhile, while investigating the case, the then SHO of the Talwandi Sabo police station Manpreets sisters innocent and submitted a report in a court. After years-long judicial proceedings, finding the woman and her paramour to be the culprit, the Additional District and Sessions Judge awarded life term to both in each incident of murder, which amounted to double life imprisonment. Meanwhile, the court acquitted the sisters of Manpreet Defence counsel Udey Partap Singh said the woman and her paramour both eloped since family members got a case registered against them. After some time, they confessed to the crime to one of Harjeets relatives at Dhanaula town. Moreover, after getting arrested about three years ago, the woman herself led the police to recover the bottle of the poison, which she administered to the children. he added. On a query about filing an appeal in the higher courts, he said, Nobody from the womans side had ever come in the court when the proceedings were continuing. But we are expecting that the convicted man will file an appeal in the HC, but that too will be done only after getting a copy of the judgment.","['sisters', 'sons', 'chandigarh', 'tribune', 'life', 'india', 'poison', 'singh', 'woman', 'case', 'children', 'paramour', 'manpreet']","The woman had first poisoned her husband to death and later her two children also met with the same fate in 2005.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,[],2013-04-02 00:00:00,"The medical college and its associated hospitals are often in the news for patient-doctor clashes mainly due to huge pressure on the staff. Though in some cases, medical staff is also responsible for not paying attention to the patients, but owning to a huge influx of the people for medical help, they are unable to deal with all the cases.

Why should we suffer because of the misdeeds of others? There are only few doctors available in the wards and our relatives are suffering because of the strike. This issue should be sorted out immediately, said Sharda Devi, an attendant.

Meanwhile due to the strike by the paramedical staff, medical services were affected in the GMC while the number of attendants was seen looking for staff to provide essential medicines to the patients.

Though the senior officers of the Department of Health tried to pacify the protesters, but they did not relent and asked the hospital administration to create better security arrangement in the college. The strike continued till reports came in late last night.

He alleged the deceased was an alcoholic and was in a critical condition when he was admitted in the hospital. We tried our best to help him but he did not respond to treatment and died, junior doctors maintained.

Rather than preventing the attendants of the patient from ransacking the emergency block, the police was encouraging them. There is no security for the junior doctors who face abuse from attendants everyday, a protesting doctor said.

They also demanded replacement of J&K police personnel from the premises of the hospital alleging that they had encouraged the attendants of the deceased last night to attack them. Meanwhile, para-medical staff also went on strike on Monday afternoon following scuffle between the attendants and a senior doctor.

Jammu, April 1 As many as 300 junior doctors working at the Government Medical College (GMC) today demanded deployment of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel to provide them security at the hospital. The doctors also struck work in protest against the thrashing of their colleagues and ransacking of the emergency block on Sunday night by family members of patient who had died in the hospital. Patients were subjected to great inconvenience due to the strike. Only senior doctors were on duty.

Till last reports came in, separate meetings of the civil and senior police officers chaired by the respective Deputy Commissioners were going on at Udhampur and Ramban to resolve the issue.

Denying all these charges, one of the top officers of the LWCPL preferring to remain anonymous said the Labour Laws are applicable to employees only and not the daily wagers and the workers are being paid very lucrative wages besides peerless allowances, facilities and incentives. All these terminated workers have criminal cases registered against them, he said.

Yet another chance of any settlement was wasted today as like other hearings (March 14 and 25) none of the LWCPL officers attended the court of the Central Regional Labour Commissioner, Jammu. Their representative declined to get involved in any settlement today, alleged Om Prakash, J&K, CITU general secretary.

The LWCPL has been recruiting and terminating the poor workers unlawfully. The hapless workers are recruited after asking them to sign on an affidavit having unreasonable conditions. When they protest against the violation of their rights, they are terminated without serving any prior notice, alleged Arshad.

The trio was instigated by one of the local leaders who was terminated a few months ago for theft.

According to sources, following the termination of its three local workers on Thursday allegedly for assaulting and threatening the senior officers by them on Wednesday, the workers went on strike on both the portals simultaneously on Wednesday night under the leadership of M Arshad Malik and Rashid Malik alias Billa, president and vice-president of the C-N Tunnel Workers Committee. The committee is affiliated with the Centre of Indian Trade Union (CITU) headed by the CPI (M) J&K, general secretary, MY Tarigami. The committee demanded the reinstatement of all their terminated workers.

The LWCPL incurs a loss of Rs 1 crore per day on each portal (end) of the tunnel. The alleged failure of the local administration in providing the security and the congenial environment prompted the Project Director, LWCPL, Bruce Neave, in threatening to pull off the project and leave it half way during a meeting in the office of the DC, Ramban, SV Meena, on Saturday.

Batote, April 1 The timely completion of the 9 km Chenani-Nashri (C-N) tunnel, Asias longest road tunnel, is doubtful as the workers continued their strike for the fifth day today. The management of the Australian company, Leighton Wellspun Contractors Pvt Ltd (LWCPL), executing the project for the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has threatened to leave the project half way.

State Sports Council not happy with state of affairs,

rue lack of funds

Tribune News Service Jammu, April 1

The recently concluded 53rd General Council Meeting of the J&K State Sports Council witnessed a flurry of questions from the members of autonomous sports body relating to the development of sports in the state. Most of the members had expressed dissatisfaction over the present state of affairs. The meeting was chaired by Chief Minister Omar Abdullah who is also the president of the Sports Council. Feroze Ahmad Khan, Minister of State for Youth Services and Sports, had informed the House that the J&K Horse Polo Association was not working for the development of the sport in Ladakh Division currently. He said all polo activities in Ladakh were organised by the Polo Foundation Committee, Drass, with the financial support of Lalit Suri Foundation. He desired that financial help be provided to the said body for the promotion of traditional polo sports annually. Dr Sheikh Mustafa Kamal, member, Sports Council, claimed that no grant in aid had been provided to the J&K Kayanking and Canoeing Association during the last two years. He further said two sets of Kayak/Canoe boats, approved by the standing committee, had not yet been procured and the liability of the 34th National Games was not cleared and paid to the association. It was decided that Secretary, State Sports Council, would sought the convenience of Chief Minister for conferment of Sher-i-Kashmir Sports Awards for the period 2002-03 to 2009-10. SM Bali, another member of the Sports Council, sought early release of the funds. He said despite a number of activities carried out by the J&K Handball Association, no grant in aid was provided to the association. He added that the awards under various categories, adopted by the council in 2002, were not provided to the officials or sportspersons. Bali claimed that some outstanding sportspersons of the past had not yet been recruited, despite the identification of posts. However, the secretary, State Sports Council, was asked to look into the matter and take up the issue with General Administration Department (GAD) for early clearance of pending cases. Romesh Mahajan proposed that stadia/fields should not be given for non-sports functions adding that it disrupted the normal activities. Later, it was decided that the fields would be provided for non-sports functions where chances of damage to the fields were minimum. International Wushu player Kuldip Handoo pointed out that there was no sports policy in J&K and suggested that the same should be framed on the pattern of the neighbouring states. He also proposed amendments in SRO-349 on priority basis.

Challenges posed by global economic meltdown discussed at conference

Our Correspondent Katra, April 1

A UGC-sponsored National conference on contemporary issues in business with reference to global economic meltdown was held on the campus of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University (SMVDU), Katra, today.

Talab Tillo residents block traffic against inflated power bills

Tribune New Service Jammu, April 1

Residents of Talab Tillo today blocked traffic at the Jewel-Talab Tillo road for 30 minutes against the Power Development Department (PDD) alleging inflated power bills. However, officials said they were defaulters who do not want to pay their tariffs. A large number of residents led by Sanjeev Sharma blocked the Jewel-Talab Tillo road and raised slogans against the department alleging harassment at the hands of the power department. Protesters alleged that some families had been served inflated bills, which far exceeds their consumption. We have met the officials in this regard but they have not shown any interest in solving the issue. Instead they are asking us to pay the bills or face disconnection of power supply, Sharma said. He also warned of marching towards the office of the Chief Engineer if no step was taken to solve their issues. Executive Engineer of the area, Devinder Kundal, feigned ignorance about the issue. He said he had no knowledge about alleged inflated bills. At times some defaulters try to pressurise us alleging that bills are wrong. There is no such case. The government has already launched an amnesty scheme and if they have any problem in this regard, they can benefit from the scheme, Kundal said. He claimed that in 90 per cent of the cases, people who were not paying bills on time leveled allegations against the department. The PDD claims of having constituted effective special enforcement wing to expose power thieves, but the wing has failed to deal with the menace. Left without police help or adequately trained staff, most of the employees engaged by department avoid localities where power theft was rampant. Political interference makes these squads think twice before laying their hands on influential persons, he said.

After the same is passed by the Majlis, the panchayat adopts the same through a resolution. He said regarding supervision and monitoring of the schemes, the sarpanch distributes those functions among various members who report back to the panchayat. He said the elected members of panchayat monitor and supervise the functioning of the SSA and NRHM schemes.

Our Correspondent Rajouri, April 1

The Jammu and Kashmir Human Development Foundation (JKHDF), Rajouri, today demanded the transfer of Jammu and Kashmir Bank Branch Manager, Manjakote, for the branchs alleged indiscipline with costumers, which has resulted in serious anguish among the people of the area. Speaking here in a press conference at Rajouri, Chairman of JKHDF Mohammed Sayed Mugal said some people of the region had approached him to complain of the misbehaviour and alleged indiscipline of Bank Manager, Manjakote, a few days back. He said, When I approached the bank, along with some other members of the society, I was astonished to see the arrogance and the low level of functioning of the bank. Mughal alleged that on one side the J&K Bank says customer satisfaction is our Motto, and on the other hand the staff misbehaves with costumers. A local, Rahil Lone, said the common man was suffering in the situation and that residents appeal to the Chairman of J&K bank to take necessary action against the branch manager so that people can get proper services instead of harassment. They have also appealed to the Chairman of the J&K Bank to appoint a new manager who would work for the masses.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,[],2013-06-17 00:00:00,"OPEN HOUSE response

Cops murder brings forth lacunae in policing Inspector Sucha Singh's gruesome murder has brought to the fore some of the lacunae in policing. It should be made mandatory for all the Inspectors, particularly those performing night duty, to carry arms. Besides, a gunman should be put on duty along with the driver on a PCR petrol vehicle. Any suspect, when apprehended, must be thoroughly frisked before he is taken to a police station for interrogation. SC Luthra, MHC, Mani Majra Quick response teams To deal with emergency situations, the police should have quick response teams. The PCR has a major role to play in such situations, so patrolling should be more intensive. The personnel manning the PCR vehicles should be armed and they should have more powers to take appropriate action in emergency situations. Anand, IPS officer, MHC, Mani Majra A matter of shame It is really a matter of utter shame and concern that the ""kind hearted"" Inspector Sucha Singh was not given any security cover even during night patrolling. It is more shameful to learn that even the armed policeman present on the district courts premises did not come to the rescue of the deceased Inspector and instead ran away to ""save his own life"". This is really a matter of disgrace for the Chandigarh Police. The policeman, who was on duty at the district courts that night, should be taken to task. Had he acted with courage and tackled the murderer, Sucha Singh would have been alive today. Contrary to the slogan of the Chandigarh Police, ""We Care for You"", the Chandigarh Police had failed to protect its own officer. RK Kapoor, Chandigarh Poor preparedness The incident has exposed the level of preparedness of the UT Police to deal with such situations. This has raised concern over the status of safety and security of the people of Chandigarh. There is an urgent need to take steps to improve policing. The inspector was without his service weapon. Slow response from the police to the distress call made by the injured home guards volunteer proved fatal for Sucha Singh. Moreover, had the constable, who was on duty at the old district courts complex, reacted swiftly, things would have been different as claimed by the home guards volunteer who was injured in the attack. The accused escaped under the nose of the UT police due to a lack of coordination. Vidya Sagar Garg, Panchkula Police officers should be well-equipped To deal with such situations, the whole Police Department should remain alert and cooperate with each other. The police officers on duty should be well-equipped and should carry their service weapons while on duty. The PCR officers and their subordinates should be alert enough to attend to emergency calls and act swiftly. Such steps, if followed, would definitely help in bringing down the rate of heinous crimes. Priya Darsh Growar, Mohali Erring officers should be dealt with strictly Negligence shown by the sector 17 police station staff when the Home Guards volunteer, Jatinder Singh, made a distress call speaks volume of the state of affairs in the UT Police. The erring officers should be immediately chargesheeted and a vigilance enquiry should be marked against them. The MP, Pawan Kumar Bansal, should take up with the Inspector-General of Police the issue of deputing two patrolling parties in each sector and colony. While one party will patrol clockwise, the other will move anti-clockwise in their respective area. The SHOs do not conduct community group meetings. Former IPS officer Kiran Bedi used to supervise night patrolling but today everyone prefers to take a rest in his air-conditioned rooms. People have lost faith in the police and criminals have no fear of it. Anshu Chawla, Chandigarh Deploy armed policemen on 'nakas' The gruesome murder of Inspector Sucha Singh at a place, which is barely meters away from the sector 17 police station, and the stabbing of the PCR vehicle driver, Jatinder Singh, by a suspended policeman of the UT police, Basant Singh, aka Bunty, has opened a Pandora's box of troubles for the Chandigarh Police. The dastardly murder of the cop has not only exposed deeper chinks in the functioning of the force but has also falsified the police top brass' rhetoric of having put in place a state-of-the-art mechanism to curb crime in the city. One wonders how the killer cop and his paramour managed to flee in the police vehicle covering a fairly good distance from the crime scene to Dhanas. It appears more like a typical Bollywood film scene. To curb the increasing incidents of crime in the city, the police top brass needs to go for a quick revamp of the force in letter and in spirit. 'Nakas' and other vantage exit and entry check points must be manned by armed personnel and the PCR vehicles must be asked to report to the control room their place of location every now and then. Ramesh K Dhiman, Chandigarh Speedy punishment The gruesome murder needs to be condemned in the strongest possible words by one and all. It is unfortunate that when the police officials are being brutally attacked, our protests against such heinous crimes are more perfunctory and less vociferous. Every effort should be made to raise strong protests to isolate such criminals so that they are given a speedy punishment and justice is provided to the aggrieved persons. NP Manocha, Chandigarh PCR staff acted with sheer callousness The local police acted with sheer callousness and ineffectively to save the precious life of their own Inspector. During the 10-minute struggle, the killer policeman repeatedly stabbed both the Inspector and the Home Guards volunteer. In between, the police control room was contacted four times but the PCR help came after the accused had fled the scene with the police vehicle. The way the accused escaped from the crime scene, which is just 60 metres from the Sector 17 police station, in a police vehicle and the failure of the police to trace them speak volumes of the inefficiency of the police force. Puran Kant, Chandigarh Ensure safety of cops There have been several instances in the city where police personnel have been slapped, abused or dragged by rash drivers. While a majority of such cases involve traffic police personnel, the personnel of the other wings are also not entirely safe. There is a need for taking steps to ensure safety of police personnel. Dr Shruti K Chawla, Chandigarh Need to improve police efficiency The Chandigarh Administration must introduce a slew of measures to strengthen the police force. It needs to improve its efficiency in order to protect the public. The shortage of staff causes tremendous hardships to police officials while coping with increasing work. They have to work for extra hours. They have no fixed hours for meals, time to relax and have to be away from their families for long, which cause stress and affect their health. Inspector Bakshish Singh had died of heart attack. Ajit Singh, Canada OPEN HOUSE QUESTION Poor infrastructure and the failure of the authorities to upgrade the power sub-stations have resulted in frequent power cuts. The failure of the UT Administration to initiate power sector reforms has added to the power problem. What needs to be done to improve the quality of power supply in the city?

Nowadays getting a book published depends on many factors, including the idea, the readability factor, whether it can be marketed and how the work is rated by the casual readers

Manpriya Khurana Behind every love story that makes it, there are countless that don't. Behind every novel that gets published, there are several manuscripts that don't. Long back, someone must have judged the potential of Erich Segal's Love Story. The most novel of ideas might never get inked or make it to the shelves. What goes on in the minds of a publisher is never a predictable question; nevertheless, we try. Not surprisingly, the target audience and marketing form a constant criterion. Shares Harish Jain, owner, Unistar Books Pvt Ltd, ""Be it romance, be it any other genre in fiction, there are certain factors that are always look into when we are thinking over whether a manuscript should be published or not. These are the idea; the readability factor and whether it can be marketed as desired."" At times, it's the sheer volume, at times, it's the sheer variety, but which book finally makes it depends on how well it is rated by the casual readers. Not that they don't go back to the basics - back in school, basic things that marked out a good essay from a bad one! ""First and foremost we check the storyline. How unique and untold it is. Then comes the writing style, which has to be really good and match our standards. Then the author's profile is also looked into. Whether it is his second book or the first,"" shares Azeem Ahmad Khan, publisher, General Press. He adds, ""This criterion is especially true of contemporary fiction."" Ultimately, it remains a battle to increase the print runs. ""Only lately there has been a remarkable shift from the content to the marketing strategy. Now increasingly, things like the author's profile matter much more,"" opines Rohit Ohri, region-based literary agent. Literary quality might not be the sole criterion to judge, but it stays sure and secure. ""There are three things that matter. Originality of idea, continuity of thought and the target market,"" says Kapish G. Mehra, managing director, Rupa Publications. He adds, ""We receive around ten manuscripts every day and only 150 to 180 get published in a year. There is an in-house process; there are commissioning agents who do the selection or rejection."" What works with one might not work with the other. Shares Azeem Ahmad Khan, ""There is a team comprising published authors that decides whether a given plot makes the cut; if there is an interesting chapter then the entire manuscript is called for. The entire process takes about three to four weeks."" More often than not, the entire exercise is a hit and trial. ""Every

reader has an interest area; when a proposal comes for rating it is given to the reader who falls in that interest area, he or she gives the initial feedback and from then on the next stage takes over,"" adds Harish Jain. What works with the market is an even bigger question. Even JK Rowling was once upon a time an unpublished author! manpriya@tribunemail.com

Mix-ing style

Thanks to the technology and exposure, it is not difficult to release an album today, shares DJ Teenu

Jasmine Singh At first Punjabi music caught the fancy of Bollywood and now it looks like electronic music is luring music-makers in the industry. And when it is electronic music, we cannot forget the source 'Deejays'. Finally, from the small cubicles to tinselville, deejays are doing a fairly good job! We met up with one such from the tribe, DJ Teenu, who will be performing at Lush, Hotel Icon, Sector-8, Chandigarh. ""Electronic music is a global phenomenon; it is taking over from pop music. Many international artistes like Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony are also influenced by dance music. Why should Bollywood be far behind?"" questions DJ Teenu, who is doing remix music for films. And you thought deejays are only meant to play at select lounges or parties? Laughs Teenu, ""In fact, many deejays are becoming music producers. Thanks to the technology and exposure, it is not difficult to release an album today. One doesn't need to look for music companies. There are certain portals where you can sell your music and there you are."" The excitement in his voice is evident. DJ Teenu will be releasing his solo album Dreams next month and besides this, he is touring, playing music and making it popular. But hang on for a second, aren't all deejays doing the same? ""You got me,"" he breaks into a long laugh. ""I should have known this was coming. There are some good music producers, and others like to follow them. Nevertheless, with music and especially global music becoming a global phenomenon, I don't think there should be any issue of 'getting monotonous.'

Forty per cent of British women do not change their hairstyle because lack of confidence The average Brit woman has had the same hairstyle for six years and 153 days while nearly half haven't changed it since they were a teenager because they lack the confidence to change their image, a new research has revealed. Most have never changed the way they dress or do their make-up either, because they worry how their partner or women friends might react. Forty per cent of style-stuck women think their hair needs a refresh, but are also deterred by salon prices, according to the poll carried out by Remington. ""There's nothing wrong with having a consistent image that you're comfortable with, but many women would like to be a bit braver and refresh their image now and again,"" Nikki McReynolds, marketing director for Remington, said. ""It seems the biggest barrier is worrying about how other people will react or whether the new look will suit them. If bored or unhappy with their current style, women can build their self-confidence gradually by experimenting with small changes, rather than drastically altering their image,"" McReynolds stated.  ANI

More than beer!

Jigyasa Kapoor Chimra Hops n Grains in Sector 9, Panchkula, is the tricitys first microbrewery; three-floors and two bar-restaurants, this is surely the place for beer loversthe Light Lager, Premium Lager, Weiss and Dunkel! And with a qualified brew master on their premises, they definitely score higher than the canned brands. Thats not allyou also get a variety of alcoholic drinks to go with sumptuous food. Though the exteriors of the restaurant are quite plain, the inside is a mix of wood, iron, glass and unfinished concrete; the best part is you can view the tanks and the brewery from all the three floors. The restaurant primarily serves Indian, but also includes dishes from varied cuisines and has a separate pizza menu that includes a few other Italian dishes. However, we should not forget this is a brewery and most people are here to enjoy a mug of beer, so appetizers are their forte. The menu is replete with entrées and one can try their beer batter prawns, chicken tikka platter, peri-peri fish, brewmeisters chicken (these are chicken drumsticks marinated with dunkel beer, herbs and spices). In vegetarian you can try kabula kebabs (kebabs made of chickpeas) or the tried and tested panner tikka. But thats not all; one can choose from a variety of other dishes as well. For the main course, in Indian their dal makhani is a must try but we tried Italian and it was awesome. Their Bruschettas are good and have been altered in size for a quick snack. In pastas you can go for Fettuccine pesto and Parmesan sauce pasta. Since pizzas have a separate menu so they deserve special attention; try their chicken tikka pizza in the non-vegetarian variety and exotic pizza is the vegetarian variety.

Spice of nature

Poonam Bindra Bringing in the five elements of nature into the ambience, Spice Cube, a new venture, is all set to whet the appetite of the gourmand tribe of Ludhiana. Situated in Kartar Bhavan (fifth floor) Spice Cube overlooks the green PAU grounds on one side and the sparkling lights of Ferozepur Road on the other. It has become the destination for not just Shakaharis but all. As Angad Singh, a businessman quips, I am a hardcore non- vegetarian but Spice Cube is teaching me how to relish vegetarian food as well. He enjoys the starters lotus stem crispy and the soft paneer malai tikka. Interspersed with cascading waterfalls over glass panels falling into gravelled spaces, the wooden interiors give a total earthy look. The farther end of the restaurant boasts of an open terrace, which has small waterfalls and a benign Buddha statue. We catch up with Suryansh Oswal and his friends sipping mocktails, while enjoying the cool breeze This Blue Lagoon is the ideal blend and my friend Ritikesh swears by the Orange Melody cocktail. Another couple who wanted to remain anonymous says, We have been coming here every alternate day for their mushroom duplex snacks and golden garlic soup. According to Inderpal Singh, owner Spice Cube, Seventy per cent of the food is cooked without onion and garlic. It has completely different flavours. On the left of the entrance is a convertible party room, which can play host to 75 to 100 guests. It has become a favourite spot for couple kitty parties who are always on the look-out for new places to dine. Sheena and Arun Mujral who were hosts for a dining kitty feel relaxed. It is hard to find authentic exotic vegetarian food. We have special tandoori fruit chat and kamal kakari ki chat. The Chinese food chef Chewang Du Lepacha dishes out the best pan fried noodles with the right mix of the crunch and softness followed by yummy date pancake and ice-cream. The sauces were made in-house and the flavours incorporated accordingly. The cafe menu for the coffee seekers between 4 to 7 pm includes pastas, pizzas and doughnuts. Price point  A meal for two would cost Rs 700 to 800 plus taxes while the morning kitty goers can look for a price of Rs 260 plus taxes per head.

In this biting cold, try the warmth of Kashmiri cuisines

Vasudha Gupta The flavour of Kashimiri food is strong enough to intoxicate the foodie in you. Kashmiri Wazwaan at Taj Chandigarh does just that. Bringing together not only the cuisine but also the warmth of Kashmir in the loom that accompanies weavers from Kashmir to bring its true essence to Chandigarh. A weavers delight In one corner of the hotel are three weavers sitting besides an intricately done peacock shawl and busy copying a design from the graph. This is 100 per cent cashmere, Divya, from Ezma informs. Working diligently separating the thread from the wool, sits another man, wearing the typical Kashmiri cap. Surrounded by multi-hued looms, the set up paints a pretty picture. Sharing details about the process of bringing a kaani to life, she says, The specialists with us have replicated the original process of kaani weaving in a big way. The base of the shawl is put in the loom and different coloured threads are wrapped on the wooden sticks to weave them into the given design. The entire impact of the kaani takes body through the number of threads being used and the intricacy of the pattern. More the colours, higher will be the price range, she says. Apart from the hand woven delights, there is also the baby cashmere available at the store along with the imperial range of shawlsthe ones which sweep through a ring. Kashmiri delicacies The first major contribution of the Kashmiri Pandits was on the food scene. The Kashmiri cuisine was then influenced by the cultures which arrived with the invasion by Timur. A sneak peak of the fine food has been organised exclusively for the festivalSewa Singh, chef from Taj Vivanta, Srinagar brings the spices and tang from Kashmir on the table. After 10 years of experience, there is no doubt that his approximations with the ingredients go beyond a normal understanding. Serving the authentic five dishes in the main menu will be part of the regular lunch and dinner buffet. The rista, made of mutton and fresh fat in red sauce, is exceptional along with the goushtaba in white sauce. If you are a vegetarian, try out the nadri yakhani, made out of lotus stem. The paneer kaliya laced with pronounced flavour and Kashmiri tomato paneer are two other options worth trying. So, if the serenity of Kashmir still keeps you in a state of frenzy, its time to get the slice of the beauty, flavour and the tehzeeb of the land. (On till January 29) vasudha@tribunemail.com

Trust gain

Mona In a world where everything sells, Trust Research Advisory (TRA) claims to have actually made a scientific tool to measure trust. Brand Trust Report, India Study 2012, puts LG on the top, Cadburys in the second spot followed by Ponds at third in Chandigarh. The head of research at TRA, Sachin Bhosle, in Chandigarh on Thursday, says, Trust is the most essential bond in all relationships, including social as well as commercial. We at TRA have developed the trust matrix based on the inputs from sociologists, psychologists and behavioural scientists. Brand Trust Report, India Study, 2012 not only compiled data for trusted brands but also personalities led by Anna Hazare. The report might be of interest to companies (its available for sale at Rs 10,000), but its the parameters of measuring trust that interested us. Amongst its 61 parameters, its empathy, non-threatening ambience and perceived competence take the topmost place. Well, if Sachin is to be believed, it should work in relationships as well! mona@tribunemail.com

Bebo shuttling between the Khans Kareena Kapoor's life is all about the Khans in her life. She has beau Saif, new co-star Imran Khan, and her favourite co-star is Aamir Khan. When she is busy with the post production of Talaash and is with Aamir he keeps asking her about Imran and teasing her that she only wants to work with Imran. When she is promoting Karan Johar's Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu, Imran constantly keeps teasing her about Maamu and how she gives him all the attention. Since the maama-bhanja are so busy with their respective films and hardly get the time to meet each other these days, Kareena is the messenger for them. She keeps Imran updated about Aamir and Aamir updated about Imran, depending on what she is doing and who she is with. She loves playing messenger and mediator between them because she loves them both and loves all the attention they shower on her. Kareena says, ""It is an absolute pleasure working with Aamir Khan and the young Imran Khan. Both are really very adorable as co-stars and people."" Imran Khan says, ""Oh that's an easy banter. I love to tease Kareena that she has no time for me and is giving all attention to Aamir and his film. I keep telling her that we waited for her to make Ek Main Aur Ekk Tuu. We were convinced only she could have done the role. She was our first and only choice."" Ek Main Aur Ekk Tuu releases on February 10 and Talaash releases in June.

Abhay moves on

wise choice: Abhay Deol

Abhay Deol was last seen in commercial films Aisha and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. He is presently acting in Shanghai. ""I want to do films which make money and I have reached a point where I can strike a balance as people know what my capabilities are as an actor. But I can't do films which are not relatable. There has to be a story line, a strong role. ""When I entered Bollywood I wanted people to see who I am as an actor and over the period I have been selective about my work. I had always wanted to strike a balance as far as acting is concerned.. do the singing and dancing and do meaningful roles too,"" Abhay said. The actor is reuniting with his Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye director Dibakar Banerjee in Shanghai where he plays an IAS officer. ""Shanghai has shaped up really well... I am really proud of this movie...It is about what we in our country go through... corruption, poverty, lack of education. Doing the film was an eye opener for me. I got to know so many facts about our system. Only Dibakar can make a film so serious in nature and yet so entertaining,"" Abhay said. Shanghai also stars Emraan Hashmi and Kalki Koechlin in pivotal roles and Abhay is all praise for his co-star Emraan. ""He is a really cool guy.. I have only two scenes with him in the film but he is a fabulous actor. It is sad that he got stuck with the serial kisser image because of which his acting got neglected,"" Abhay said. The actor is set to team up with his Aisha co-star Sonam Kapoor again in Rajkumar Santoshi's next and it seems that he has put their public spat behind him. ""I don't want to get into the past.. what has been done has been done.. I am still discussing it (role) with him (Santoshi). Haven't signed the film yet,"" the actor said.  PTI

Natural vs made up Kelly Brook, who is gifted with a naturally fabulous body, appears to have made a few enemies after she recently slammed celebrities for revealing they have been under the knife. In an open letter to Brook, Ulrika Jonsson, who has in the past admitted to surgery, has criticised the TV presenter. ""You possess the perfect female form - of course you're happy with your body!"" wrote Jonsson. ""Little wonder then that you've made a living out of showing your body off - and perhaps less from your brains,"" she wrote. The 44-year-old also accused Brook, who is dating former Scottish International Rugby player Thom Evans, of being insensitive to other women. ""To hear you lambasting women less happy with their body, who have opted for surgery, is like a Porsche bitching about a Reliant Robin,"" she wrote. The mother of four had a 6,000-pound breast reduction and lift after having children. ""Kelly, some of us weren't born with the fabulous genes you've inherited,"" she said. Jonsson also goes on to warn Brook of what Mother Nature has in store for her if she has children. The presenter explained how she had to have a breast reduction after her cup size expanded to 36I. She states celebrities talking openly about surgery is honest and a positive influence on women, who are often duped into believing stars achieve their look simply through diet and exercise. Jonsson's outrage comes after 32-year-old last week slammed celebrities for 'devaluing women'.  ANI

Difficult career choices Actor George Clooney says he has made some ""dumb"" career choices and is not proud of all his work. The 50-year-old feels ""lucky"" that most of the work he did, that he is not proud of, was made early in his professional life because there were just few people who remember that. ""I've certainly made some turkeys along the way and made some dumb choices in my career, mostly early on. I'm one of the lucky ones who got to make a lot of mistakes very early on when no one was paying attention,"" he says. ""I did a lot of terrible TV shows and was really terrible in them, but nobody really noticed,"" he added.  IANS

Shahid on Imran Usually actors replace actors and actresses replace actresses but for Punit Malhotra's second film, Shahid Kapoor's entry meant Sonam Kapoor's exit. Shahid replaced Imran Khan in the movie as well. Shahid Kapoor was to work with Dharma Productions in Kall but he opted out of the film at the last minute because Karan Johar and his then gal pal Kareena Kapoor were not on talking terms. It was a wise move since the film flopped. Now, he is getting a second chance to work with Karan Johar in a film directed by Punit Malhotra. Imran Khan opted out of the film because he wanted to focus on Vishal Bhardwaj's Matru Ki Bijlee Ka Mandola. A source tells us, I Hate Luv Storys could have been the only hit of Sonam's career. It is believed that she opted out of them when Imran opted out. Karan is not keen on casting Sonam in Punit's film with Shahid on board because their pairing didn't work in Mausam. So Karan and UTV don't want to make the same mistake. Sonam is absolutely fine not doing the film directed by her rumoured boyfriend. The makers are looking for another leading lady. Anushka Sharma could get the role since their pairing worked in Badmaash Company and they have a good rapport . Both of them are versatile and urban and connect with audiences of different ages.  HRM

""Jen's done it and told Demi it really helped raise her confidence,"" said a source.  IANS Playing a gangster Irrfan Khan will play the gangster in the sequel to Saheb, Biwi aur Gangster. He replaced Neil Nitin Mukesh because the makers wanted someone older. Mahie and Jimmy reprise their roles and Randeep makes a comeback in the sequel.

Negative streak: Rucha Gujrati

Playing opposites Playing Kiya in Sonys Saas Bina Sasural, a role totally opposite to her real self, sweet-natured, petite beauty Rucha Gujarati claims she is having fun essaying the manipulative character on television. She speaks about her role and much more. How has the response been to your entry in Saas Bina Sasural? It has been very warm and I am glad to have such a well etched role of Kiya. She is a London-returned modern girl who just wants to live life on her terms. When she learns that she will have to marry Ved to inherit her dads money, she becomes manipulative. Why did you choose this role? Kiya is an amazing character and the role will give me various shades to play, which is what attracted me to it. Kiya is a modern girl who believes in herself but has to do wrong things to get her way. Do you enjoy playing negative roles more than positive ones? Not at all. I am open to playing all kind of roles. In the past I have done many positive roles like Bhabhi where I played the positive lead for over 800 episodes and then came Waaris where I had a positive role. As an actor, you look for challenging and worthwhile parts. I have been selective, which is why I chose Kiya as I liked the character. What is Kiyas plan? I cant tell you anything about her plan but yes she is going to move forward and try to get married to Ved, knowing he is in love with Nitika. She is aware that Chedilal is on her side while others are not. Kiya is hell bent on marrying Ved because if she is married to him for a year, the property will be hers. Watch the show to know what happens next? It is heard that all guys in the cast are super nice to you Yes, though I am the new one in the gang, everyone has been wonderful to me. They are all friendly people and brilliant actors. They are all very sweet and amazing. I am enjoying being on the sets. What does your family say about this role? They are enjoying that I am playing Kiya on screen. Of course, I am not like Kiya at all in real life. I am opposite of what she is in the show.  HRM

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,[],2004-06-08 00:00:00,"Unapproved Bt cotton seed on sale in Punjab

K.S. Chawla Ludhiana, June 7

Cotton growers of Punjab have taken the risk of sowing unapproved Bt cotton varieties in their enthusiasm to bring the maximum area under Bt cotton this year. Scientists of Punjab Agricultural University have expressed their concern over the sale of unapproved Bt cotton varieties in Punjab at a higher price. Punjab Agricultural University has conducted trials of various Bt cotton varieties for the northern region comprising Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan and found only eight varieties fit for the cultivation. But the Union Ministry of Environment and Science and Technology has not granted permission for the release of the same this year. The Union Government is likely to grant approval of these varieties next year. According to Dr G.S. Chahal, Additional Director, Research, PAU, it is almost certain that a couple of Bt cotton hybrid varieties would be available for cultivation in Punjab during the crop season of 2005. But a point of serious concern for the revival of cotton and economy of cotton growers is unqualified attraction of our farmers towards Bt cotton. The availability and success for Bt cotton in rest of India has genuinely allured the cotton growers of Punjab to procure Bt cotton by all means. Dr Chahal discloses that it is estimated by private traders that 2.5 to three lakh seed packets of 450 gm each of Bt cotton have been marketed which may cover an area of about three lakh acres  20 per cent of the total area would be under cultivation of unauthorised Bt cotton. The area under such unauthorised cotton seed in Mansa and Bathinda districts is expected to be of still higher magnitude. What is most disturbing is the fact that there is no guarantee about Bt status of such seed that has been sold and sown. Even for genuine Bt cotton, the suitability and success of these hybrid varieties under Punjab conditions are not known. So far only two Bt cotton varieties NECH 162 and MECH 184 have been recommended for the central zone and only MECH 12 for the south zone. It has been noted that farmers got the seed of MECH 12 which is not approved even for central zone, including Gujarat. The seed traders even contracted farmers in villages and unlabeled seed of so-called Bt cotton has been sold at prices of their liking which ranged from Rs 500 to as high as Rs 3,000 per packet of 450 gm. Dr Chahal warned, The use of such untested and unsuitable Bt cotton is likely to become a source of disaster for the already ailing cultivation of cotton in Punjab. According to information available with this reporter, the area under cotton is going to be more this year as the crop last year was very good and the growers got record high price of their produce ranging from Rs 2,600 to Rs 2,850 per quintal. Because of this fact, the farmers showed renewed interest in the cultivation of cotton this year and area under the same was likely to touch six lakh hectares against five lakh hectares last year. This year, with the efforts of the Financial Commissioner (Development), Dr B.C. Gupta, canal water was available as a result of which 90 per cent of the area has been sown before mid-May. According to Dr Chahal, the PAU has already eight Bt cotton varieties which were recommended for cultivation in Punjab. But as per the procedure of the government, these varieties are again being tested during the current crop season. In addition, 20 more Bt cotton varieties are being tested. The genuine seed of Bt cotton would be supplied next year by reputed companies. Dr Chahal has advised the farmers that they must protect the crop from sucking pests. A high temperature during April and early May led to burning of seedlings at certain places. But the onset of rains throughout the state has lowered the temperature and the crop has started establishing quite well. In general, the crop is expected to be good this year, say PAU experts.

Govt must promote waste management: Expert

Tribune News Service Ludhiana, October 22

Segregation of waste from industry, hospitals and homes at the source of generation is key to avoiding tragedies like Gujarat, where 100 people lost their lives to hepatitis, said environmental expert AK Jaggi, who was in the city today. Jaggi, who is the CEO of SembRanky, the firm that looks after waste management across the country, said: Waste management is an important issue and it is evident from the fact that the comptroller and auditor general of India has initiated work on environment audit. So far, the CAG, Delhi, has been busy auditing matters related to finances, etc. but now environment audit has become an important part. He was part of Stakeholders Conference on Environment Audit that was held by CAG in New Delhi. He said: The concept of waste management is getting a good response but it is not that popular and the government needs to play an active role in asking the industry and public to accept the idea. Citing examples, Jaggi said: The biomedical waste generated from hospitals is divided into three categories by management companies. This division is in colour forms like yellow, blue and white or translucent. Yellow colour is called incinerable waste that includes body parts, placenta, human tissue, etc. This type of biohazard waste is burnt. Blue colour division of waste comprises blood bags, syringes, urine bags, etc. while white colour signifies needles, glass, etc. These materials are hazardous to burn and are first disinfected or autoclaved then are shredded so that these could not be used again. Jaggi, who was part of convention that discussed amendments to the Environmental Protection Act, 1986, said the Central Pollution Control Board had already drafted some amendments to the EPA Act and these would be implemented soon.

Shellers accused of tampering with moisture meters

Our Correspondent Jagraon, October 22

The rift between sheller owners and commission agents is widening by the day even as paddy begins to pile up at grain market yards. Like previous years, lifting of paddy by the transport contractor has been a problem, as there has been a shortage of trucks and labour this year. Also, sheller owners have been accused of tampering with moisture meters. Though under the norms, paddy with moisture content higher than 17 per cent cannot be purchased by procurement agencies, in some grain markets sheller owners have allegedly tampered with their moisture meters, which display 1 to 3 per cent higher content than normal. Sheller owners allegedly use this as a tool to blackmail commission agents to adjust two to five quintal paddy per truck. The higher the moisture in the moisture meter, the higher the adjustment rate. In case commission agents refuse to pay the adjustment paddy, the consignment is turned away from the shellers, costing two-way loading/unloading labour charges along with both way fare of truck. This causes commission agents a loss of Rs 2,000 to Rs 7,000, according to the distance of the grain market from the sheller. Moisture meters of many shellers at Raikot, Jagraon, Mullanpur, etc. have been reportedly tampered with, as they show higher moisture content than that shown by market committee meters. Due to these alleged arm-twisting tactics of shellers owners, commission agents of Raikot along with procuring centres under the Raikot market committee went on a strike and not a single grain of paddy was sold to any procuring agency. At Mullanpur, too, the Kisan Sabha led by Sukhwinder Singh Sekhon, CPM district secretary, Satnam Bariach, DYFI district president, Roop Basant Singh, Kisan Sabha district secretary general, Jagan Nath Mohan, district president, Raghubir Singh, vice-president, and Tarlochan Singh, district secretary, laid siege to the market committee office at Mullanpur Dakha. They lifted the dharna after sheller union president Prem Kumar, commission agents union president Anand Saroop Singh, market committee chairman Maghar Singh Bariach and secretary Jaswinder Singh assured the protesters of not allowing sheller owners to turn away any truck once it had been loaded.

Consumers fume as PSEB fails to deliver bills

Our Correspondent Ludhiana, October 22

The Punjab State Electricity Board (PSEB) has drawn flak after failing to deliver power bills to thousands of consumers in the Atam Nagar (Unit I) subdivision falling under the Model Town division of the city west circle. The harassed consumers had to make several rounds of the sub-divisional office during the past three days to make payment of bills before the last date  October 20 (cheque payment) and October 22 (cash payment)  to avoid levy of 10 per cent surcharge. Affected consumers residing in Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, Vikas Nagar, Vishal Nagar, Pakhowal Road and Punjab Mata Nagar alleged that bills were dumped in the divisional and sub-divisional offices of the PSEB and were not delivered due to shortage of staff. When some residents made enquiries about the non-delivery of bills, they were told to locate these from heaps of bills dumped in the office and make payment on the due date, with no grace period being allowed for late delivery or non-delivery of bills. Even senior officials of the PSEB were unaware of the reason behind the non-delivery of bills in these localities and continued to make conflicting statements. While one top official claimed that spot billing was carried out in these localities and that consumers were under the wrong impression that bills had not been delivered to them, another official said residents were over-reacting. Maybe some bills were not delivered or got delayed due to certain reasons, majority of these were delivered to consumers and even technical staff was deployed for this purpose, the official maintained. The harassed consumers further charged the PSEB staff and officials at the sub-division with rude behaviour and at times flat refusing to issue a duplicate bill on the basis of reading recorded in the consumer ledger. Many consumers were told by the clerical staff to locate their bills from the heaps of bills dumped in the office or approach senior officials, alleged a resident of Vikas Nagar, who had ben trying to locate his bill or get a duplicate one for nearly two hours. Pran Bhatia, member of the District Grievances Redressal Committee, and Arvind Sharma, both residents of Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, have sought details under the Right to Information Act on the schedule of preparation and delivery of bills, tariff on which bills were prepared and the period from which revised tariff had been charged from the PSEB authorities.","['moisture', 'nagar', 'chandigarh', 'tribune', 'bills', 'waste', 'district', 'india', 'sheller', 'committee', 'pseb', 'consumers', 'singh']","This type of biohazard waste is burnt. Blue colour division of waste comprises blood bags, syringes, urine bags, etc.

Barring a dhaba, this market lacks all basic civic amenities

Kulwinder Sandhu



MAIN PROBLEMS OF THE MARKET * No parking space in front of the booths

* Deplorable condition of pavements

* Back lane is in bad shape

* Frequent waterlogging even during slight showers

* Continuous leakage from public lavatory

* No entrance to the market Active members of the market welfare association:

B.K. Jain, Jasbir Singh Chadha, Deepak Vashist and Ramesh Khanna. THE general trade market of Sector-28D in booths has not been able to pick up business as its potential is being held back due to the callous attitude of the local administration and Municipal Corporation with lack of planning and efforts to improve business. Few traders have sold their booths that are lying closed with hardly any buyers. Some have even shut down their business or either preferred to rent their property as the profits have shrunk. Out of the total of 51 booths in the market, the owners of 11 booths have either sold their property or shut down the business. Mr Jasbir Singh Chadha, an active member of the market welfare association of Sector-28D, said that the customers have shown least interest in the market for the past couple of years, particularly due to lack of any parking space in this mini-market between booth nos. 167 and 210. The only speciality of this market is the Paul Dhaba that mostly attracts maximum customers during the evening time when it is the time for other traders to shut down their business at the end of the day. However, Paul Dhaba is on the backside of this mini-market with its close proximity to the SCOs. Virtually, it plays no role in attracting customers who may have otherwise helped to boost the prospects of income to these petty traders of this mini market. With hardly any other speciality, the market has a chemist shop, five confectionary shops, two shops of car accessories, four STD booths, two paint shops, four tailors, two electrical shops, three photographers, one shop of mattress and few other local utility shops. The traders have alleged that this mini-market is a victim of the callous attitude of the Chandigarh Administration and the Municipal Corporation. The main problems include no parking space, poor conditions of the pavements, emergence of unhygienic conditions due to non-cleanliness of the backlane and adjoining vacant land etc. No parking: Surprisingly, this mini market from booth no. 167 to 210 has no parking space at all. This has badly affected the business of this market. The authorities concerned have raised the floor level of the open space lying in front of the market near the junction of the road leading to Sector-27, leaving no room for the customers to visit the booths along with their vehicles. However, sufficient space along the road within the open courtyard and at the back of booth no. 198 to 210 is available that could be made available for parking it. A shopkeeper alleged: Parking space has been provided by the local authorities in all the markets of the city with the exception that our mini-market is being treated step-motherly by the UT Administration and Municipal Corporation. No entrance: A major portion of the market lacks approach as there is no entrance provided to the booth nos. from 167 to 210. This is one of the biggest problems that the traders as well as customers are facing in this market. Deepak Vashist of Life Time Tailors said: The business has fallen prey to the callous attitude of the local politicians and the administration. Sales have declined ever since the entrance to the market was stopped by the administration last year. It may be mentioned that the authorities concerned of the local administration last year blocked the entrance to the market, as the motor mechanics encroached upon the vacant land lying at the backside and one of the other sides of the market. However, the mechanics have been removed from the area and resettled at some other place. Presently, there is not even a single mechanic operating from this market area but still the entrance has not been reopened for the general traders running their business in this market. Leakage from public lavatory: There is a public lavatory in the rear of booth Nos. 178 to 182 of this mini-market. The underground pipe of this lavatory has either cracked or blocked somewhere. Further adding to the woes of the traders, the seepage from this lavatory has started entering into the basements of booth Nos. 180 and 181. Under this situation, it has become almost impossible for the traders to keep their goods in it. Mr Vijay Kumar of Vijay Cloth House, said: We have raised the plinth level by wooden blocks to keep the clothes and mattresses/foam safe from the seepage. We have complained about this to the concerned authorities a number of times but nothing has been done so far to stop the leakage, he added. Dirty backlane: The backlane of this market is in a deplorable condition, particularly during the monsoons. It has virtually become a dumping ground for malba with water logging all around. The market welfare association has written to the authorities concerned a number of times demanding to put concrete on the backlane so as to avoid water logging. No one has ever turned up to look into the problem, said a trader. Further, at the back of booth nos. 198 to 210 there is a plenty of space available without proper use. Even during slight showers the open area becomes slippery due to water logging. It has also become a breeding ground for the mosquitoes. Mr Deepak Kumar of Paul Medicos alleged that the domestic servants working in the adjoining separated defence officers family quarters create nuisance by throwing household waste and sometimes even malba in the backlane, thereby, creating unhygienic environment. Verandah a hurdle: The traders have demanded that a verandah on the front side of the mini market joining the booths on both the sides is of no use. It has been constructed with lack of planning/ designing, said Mr Jasbir Singh Chadha. He said that the verandah is leaking from the roof during rains and has almost become a danger point. It will be better to demolish this verandah in order to avoid any mishappening. Moreover, it will help to pave the way for opening the space between the booths on both the sides to make it for proper use as parking, he added.

Ronaldo gets Ballon d’Or,TheTribune: PARIS:Cristiano Ronaldo capped a remarkable year by claiming the fourth Ballon d’Or award after leading Portugal to an emotional European Championship title and Real Madrid to a record-extending Champions League crown in 2016.,['Tribune News Service'],2016-12-14 02:03:00,"Pips Messi, Griezmann to win the coveted prize for fourth time

PARIS, December 13

Cristiano Ronaldo capped a remarkable year by claiming the fourth Ballon d’Or award after leading Portugal to an emotional European Championship title and Real Madrid to a record-extending Champions League crown in 2016.

Ronaldo is one short of the record tally of five awards won by Barcelona’s Argentina forward Lionel Messi, who was second with the pair having taken the first two spots since 2011.

“For me it’s a great honour to receive my fourth golden ball. The emotion is like for the first one, it’s a dream come true again. I never thought in my mind to win four times. I’m so happy,” said Ronaldo, who won the award in 2008, 2013 and 2014.

“It’s probably the best year of my career collectively, with Real Madrid and Portugal. Real are used to winning titles while Portugal had never won a major title so this (Euro 2016) title is special. I don’t want to lack respect to the Champions League but the title with Portugal is a level above.”

The Ballon d’Or, which merged with the FIFA World Player of the Year award from 2010-15 to create the FIFA Ballon d’Or, returned to France Football magazine this year. A total of 173 journalists voted but not national team coaches and captains who were also polled for the FIFA award.

Cut above

France and Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann, who lost to Ronaldo’s Portugal and Real in the Euro 2016 and Champions League finals respectively, took third place. Uruguay forward Luis Suarez was fourth and Brazil’s Neymar fifth, giving Barcelona three players in the top five.

Ronaldo was a cut above the competition, though. He scored 51 goals in 54 games for club and country, albeit his lowest tally since 2008, claimed another Champions League winners’ medal and lifted the European Championship trophy. Ronaldo limped off midway through the first half of July’s Euro 2016 final, which Portugal won 1-0 after extra time against hosts France, but he hobbled back onto the pitch to celebrate his country’s first major soccer title. Six weeks earlier, after a fairly anonymous performance against local rivals Atletico in the Champions League final, he scored the decisive penalty in the shootout to hand Real their 11th European Cup. It was, therefore, hard to see past 31-year-old Ronaldo for the winner of the Ballon d’Or, even if the trophy is designed to reward individual performance rather than team results.

Taxing questions spoil Ballon d’Or win

Ronaldo feels unable to celebrate his fourth Ballon d’Or award as much as his previous triumphs due to recent allegations of tax evasion. The European Investigative Collaborations (EIC) media consortium reported in early December that Ronaldo, and several other clients of soccer agency Gestifute, had used tax havens to handle tens of millions of euros in earnings. Gestifute denied the accusations last week. Ronaldo expressed his disappointment at the timing of the charges against him.

“Of course it (allegations) has spoiled it a little bit. I would be lying if I said it hadn’t. I’m not a hypocrite,” he said. “I wasn’t pleased. The whole process in itself is hard and not only for me, but also for the people alongside me: my family, my son, all those who work with me. All that irritates me because I try to do things correctly, be transparent.”

“I don’t have any reason to lie. What came out troubles me. Because it’s not true. The lie is troubling. I have done things correctly. There are a lot of innocent people in prison. And I feel a little bit like that. You know you have done nothing wrong, and they say you have done something reprehensible. No one likes that,” he added.

Villarreal beat Atletico Madrid 3-0

Villarreal thumped Atletico Madrid 3-0 to vault into the fourth place in La Liga, dropping them to sixth. Adding to Atletico’s misery, midfielder Tiago and goalkeeper Jan Oblak left the match in the first half with injuries. The hosts took a 1-0 lead in the 28th minute when Manu Trigueros took advantage of an error by Tiago and beat Oblak with an angled shot. Oblak set up the home side’s second goal with a poor clearance that ended up at the feet of Jonathan Dos Santos, who hit the post once before putting away his own rebound to make it 2-0 in the 38th minute. Roberto Soriano settled the matter with a third goal for the hosts in the stoppage time.

Chelsea, Man City fined for fracas

Chelsea and Manchester City have been fined $126,770 and 35,000 pounds, respectively, for failing to control their players during a Premier League encounter on Dec. 3. City striker Sergio Aguero’s reckless tackle on Chelsea defender David Luiz in stoppage time sparked a melee at the Etihad Stadium, with players and coaching staff from both teams involved in ugly scenes. Aguero and teammate Fernandinho were sent off and are serving four and three-game bans, respectively.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,[],2005-05-04 00:00:00,"Electrician held for Sector 18 murder

Open switchboards in house gave vital clues

Our Correspondent Chandigarh, May 3

Open electricity switchboards in the house of Brij Rani, the murdered old woman in Sector 18 here, may have provided vital clues to the police leading to the arrest of an electrician of the same sector. The police today claimed that Punit Mittal, alias Bawa, alias Tinda, killed Brij Rani under the influence of liquor on Sunday evening. The unusual fact that two or three switchboards were open in the old womans house had made the investigators suspicious on Sunday night. Since there was no sign of a forced entry into the house, the police suspected what is called a friendly entry in police parlance. This means the old woman had opened the door and let in the accused. Police sources said open switchboards strengthened the suspicion that an acquaintance may have committed the crime. The police found three switchboards open. The switchboard supplying power to the refrigerator kept in the kitchen was also open. The body of Brij Rani was also found lying in a small lobby outside the kitchen. The police questioned Jyoti, daughter of Brij Rani, whether she knew about any electrician visiting the house. Jyoti reportedly told the police about some person named Bawa or Bobby. She also said that the late Brij Rani had told her about the electrician and had said that he had not done the job properly and that she was angry about it. The electrician reportedly came to the house about 15-20 days ago. After arresting Punit Mittal for the murder of Brij Rani, the DSP of the area, Mr Vijay Pal Singh, said Mittal probably committed the crime for want of money. A resident of Sector 18 here, Mittal was arrested around 12 noon today. He was produced before a local court later, which remanded him in police custody till May 6. The DSP (East), Mr Vijay Pal Singh, told mediapersons that it was circumstantial evidence as well as the clue of the open switchboards at the scene of the crime that led the investigation to zero in on the accused. Working on this information, the police prepared a list of electricians working in that area and screened the list by checking out those who were missing from their jobs on that day. The police then came to know about Mittal, who was found to be missing. The DSP said the accused had confessed to the crime and revealed during preliminary interrogation that on Sunday evening he had a drink at the Sector 19 tavern (ahata). Mittal wanted to have more drinks but had no money on him. He then decided to go to the victims house to make some money by doing some repair work, said the DSP. The victim had called him for repairs some time back. He went to her house at around 5:30 pm and opened the switchboards in the drawing room for repairs. Brij Rani asked him to fix her refrigerator first and he went to the kitchen in the house. While opening the refrigerator switchboard, Mittal may have probably realised that Brij Rani was alone at home and the idea of looting the old woman could have crossed his mind, said the DSP. During investigation Mittal admitted that he had banged the head of Brij Rani. The old woman cried for help but her cries were drowned under the volume of the television set in her house. The gold earrings, a gold chain and other ornaments of the victim were removed after she was dead. The police said Mittal did not try to lay hands on other things fearing that somebody might come to the house. He had reportedly gone to the victims house without any tools. The police said there were abrasion marks on the upper body parts and a wound on the elbow of Mittal indicating that Brij Rani had struggled a lot to free herself from his grip.","['house', 'rani', 'mittal', 'chandigarh', 'switchboards', 'tribune', 'sector', 'old', 'india', 'brij', 'electrician', 'dsp', 'open']","The police today claimed that Punit Mittal, alias Bawa, alias Tinda, killed Brij Rani under the influence of liquor on Sunday evening.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,[],2013-06-08 00:00:00,"Though online world has its own set of challenges in the form of copyright violations, trolls and hackers; social networking has taken a regal entry on the timeline of human development. This concept is only going to get more intelligent and refined with time.

Spreading social awareness is another constructive trend that is tapping the potential of far and wide reach of social networking sites. A worth mentioning example is CSAA (Child Sexual Abuse Awareness). It began as a small initiative by a group of bloggers and has now become an annual affair. The month of April is declared as a CSAA month. During this month, people proactively share educational links, encouraging stories, incidents, safety measures against the menace of child sexual abuse on sites like Facebook. Recently, the cause of rehabilitating the family of 5-year old girl, who was brutally abused in Delhi, was also taken up by philanthropists on these channels and many people joined in that drive. Undoubtedly, social networking is a powerful medium and can work wonders in forming progressive mass movements when it comes to many social subjects.

Social media works in a unique way. We, as end users, see only one side of the social media sites. There are many companies which actually use the data that we provide through the same sites. The status messages, comments, uploads, likes and preferences that are posted on the sites are eventually sliced, diced and then sold to companies working in the sectors of product and service industry. They use the information to plan and position their future products or services in compliance with users preferences and demands. In light of this, the true definition of users for social media channels keeps changing depending on who is using which part of the media sites and for which purpose. The users could be an individual end user, the marketing department of a company, people working for social media channels and so on.

The benefits are not limited to individual setups or small-scale enterprises only. Companies like Amway are making use of social media as an integral part of their business model and their success story is for everybody to see. A study shows that as many as 90 per cent of the top 100 fortune companies are using at least one social media profile to engage with their customers. Business blogs are becoming highly prominent low-cost means to maintain web presence. Many companies are sharing their philosophy, building web traffic and connecting with existing and potential customers through blogs now.

Rekha and Maya, founders of Earthy Hues  a small entrepreneurship, rely heavily on word-of-mouth publicity. A page on Facebook by the same name has helped us create visibility in the social media. Around 40 per cent of our total sales is through Facebook, these include bulk and retail sales, they share.

Ravi Venugopal, an author and an entrepreneur says, Social media has given us a vast audience in the form of potential customers and a way to make it viral across geographies. Personal and organisational brand credibility can be gained as there is an active engagement with our audience. One of the most important uses I have had is to find referral contacts for much of my work. Social media for us, is the future of business and communication.

Shashank Shekhar, a co-owner of a fledgling company Antezen feels, The main pull of social networking sites is that your satisfied customers can become a free and an effective marketing channel for the company.

Getting an instant feedback from your readers is extremely exhilarating. The benefits are not limited to individual setups or small-scale enterprises only. Companies like Amway are making use of social media as an integral part of their business model and their success story is for everybody to see. A study shows that as many as 90 per cent of the top 100 fortune companies are using at least one social media profile to engage with their customers. Business blogs are becoming highly prominent low-cost means to maintain web presence. Many companies are sharing their philosophy, building web traffic and connecting with existing and potential customers through blogs now. Business at the back Social media works in a unique way. We, as end users, see only one side of the social media sites. There are many companies which actually use the data that we provide through the same sites. The status messages, comments, uploads, likes and preferences that are posted on the sites are eventually sliced, diced and then sold to companies working in the sectors of product and service industry. They use the information to plan and position their future products or services in compliance with users preferences and demands. In light of this, the true definition of users for social media channels keeps changing depending on who is using which part of the media sites and for which purpose. The users could be an individual end user, the marketing department of a company, people working for social media channels and so on. Social awareness Spreading social awareness is another constructive trend that is tapping the potential of far and wide reach of social networking sites. A worth mentioning example is CSAA (Child Sexual Abuse Awareness). It began as a small initiative by a group of bloggers and has now become an annual affair. The month of April is declared as a CSAA month. During this month, people proactively share educational links, encouraging stories, incidents, safety measures against the menace of child sexual abuse on sites like Facebook. Recently, the cause of rehabilitating the family of 5-year old girl, who was brutally abused in Delhi, was also taken up by philanthropists on these channels and many people joined in that drive. Undoubtedly, social networking is a powerful medium and can work wonders in forming progressive mass movements when it comes to many social subjects. Though online world has its own set of challenges in the form of copyright violations, trolls and hackers; social networking has taken a regal entry on the timeline of human development. This concept is only going to get more intelligent and refined with time.
