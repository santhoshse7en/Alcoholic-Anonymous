The fight against addiction,The challenges of treating yaba addiction in women,Anna Milovanovic-Fazliu,2018-07-17T07:26:07+06:00,"The challenges of treating yaba addiction in women As a photography student in Dhaka, I began researching yaba addiction among women in Bangladesh. I met with girls and women at various stages of addiction and treatment; from those who hesitated to call themselves addicts, to others who identified as addicts and had been through treatment. I wanted to know how, in this conservative country, women were exposed to, and accessed, illegal drugs -- as well as why they felt compelled to do so. Additionally, I wanted to ascertain the extent of their knowledge about side-effects of the drug and the potential of rehabilitation.I found that there were different push factors within different social classes, but a common factor for addiction was untreated mental health issues. Depression, anxiety -- and eventually the consequences of both left untreated -- manifest in drug abuse. Among the elite, the appeal of taking a party-drug lingers, or a desire to lose weight; for middle-class housewives, their de-facto seclusion within their homes, or conflict with their in-laws, can lead them to using. Among street children, many use once they have been prostituted -- either as a coping mechanism, or because their clients force them. Regardless of how the women are hooked, addicts continue to take the drugs because they crave the feeling of the high and want to feel that their problems have been left behind. Rehab in Dhaka (the only part of the country where women can receive treatment) is generally prohibitively expensive -- except in cases where NGOs step in and provide free treatment. Some women I spoke to recounted the benefits of Narcotics Anonymous and the 12-step program, and some saw value in the rigidly-structured therapeutic community method. Others seemed to dislike the structure of the therapeutic community method -- they spoke about their release dates as though they were in jail. I saw some rehabs trying their best, professionally, but struggling -- because of a lack of qualified female drug counsellors in Bangladesh and/or funding. Not enough women are trained in this skillset here, but with 1.1 million female drug users (16% of the addicted population in 2016 according to Madok Drobbo O Nesha Sangstha as reported by Dhaka Tribune), Bangladesh will need to focus on rehabilitating its addicts to ensure a productive generation. Many women are afraid of rehab; they fear that they will undergo electroshock therapy and be tied up, beaten, tortured, and dehumanized by staff. Unverified accounts of third parties speak of non-addicts being “imprisoned” by low-reputed rehabs that accept to pacify women who are deemed problematic. Many women do not believe rehab centres operate ethically. It is true that some private rehabs operate only for the money. They do not mind if the patients relapse, because that will mean further business for them. The same is true for many rehabilitation centres operating in Florida, US, which profit from insurance claims; so, globally, addicts are being taken advantage of in their vulnerable state. There are insufficient legitimate, regulated facilities to treat addicts in Bangladesh. More addicts would seek treatment if they were certain that they would receive professional care. There need to be more facilities that do not treat their patients as numbers to be drugged into submission. Selecting a rehab is a vital step in the recovery process, and it need not be rushed. Before parents place their addicted daughters in rehab, they must research what treatment entails, and understand its limits. Addicts remain so for life. They cannot be cured of addiction, but can only manage it. An addict can stay clean in rehab and relapse, once out, because all the triggers of addiction remain in their personal lives. Some of the triggers of addiction include: Stress due to family expectations; unemployment and a lack of job opportunities; infringement of human rights; sexual harassment in public spaces; and sexual abuse at home. Also, young people continue to be exposed to yaba as part of a “fun” night. They have few public spaces in which to spend time; and have to pay high transport costs to get to a community space in the city. Aside from eating out, many youths tell me they have nothing to do but spend time at their friend’s homes or with their dorm-mates -- and with few activities (sporting and cultural) they get high. Alcohol is difficult to acquire here. It requires an alcohol license -- which many do not procure -- and the individuals without licenses fear being caught by the police asking for bribes. To obtain the license, Muslim citizens must obtain a doctor’s permission and then apply for the license -- then may still be limited in quantities of purchases, and lose their right to sit on a jury. Many are instilled with fear to be caught with a parcel of beer. However, yaba is abundantly available, portable, and concealable. It is now competitively priced with the alcohol many fear buying. When yaba first became popular, about a decade ago, when heroin could be bought at Tk50 per packet, it cost about Tk1,200 per pill. But it can now be found (mostly adulterated) for Tk150 per pill. A locally-brewed Hunter beer can be bought for Tk150 and used to be available for Tk100-120 just a year ago. Dealers are known to provide people with a “buy five, get one free” deal, to build the habit. Yaba is harmful to the consumer, community, and cannot be consumed responsibly -- unlike alcohol.As the drug war wages on, the scarcity of marijuana is frustrating some addicts, and the slightly increased price of yaba is yielding larger profits for the remaining dealers. Marijuana has been legalized in Uruguay, Canada, and some US states, and has medical merits.While some Dhaka-based contacts of mine warn that the country is not ready to legalize marijuana or alcohol because their use would be abused, I think that keeping certain substances, which are either not harmful or can be consumed in moderation, on the market, can help prevent future yaba addiction. Another way to end yaba addiction is to tackle mental health issues. Bangla-medium schools (and many English-medium schools) lack school counsellors, but they are absolutely necessary to catch depression and anxiety at a young age. Building healthy coping mechanisms into the youth can steer them away from the escapism they currently seek.Anna Milovanovic-Fazliu is a documentary photographer with an LLM from the University of Kent.","['rehab', 'treatment', 'fear', 'community', 'rehabs', 'fight', 'addiction', 'drug', 'addicts', 'yaba', 'women']","Available, portable, concealable MUMIT MThe challenges of treating yaba addiction in womenAs a photography student in Dhaka, I began researching yaba addiction among women in Bangladesh.

"Toxic alcohol kills 93 in India, 200 hospitalized","The victims, who include many women, worked at local tea estates in the region","AFP, Guwahati",2019-02-23T17:07:18+06:00,"The victims, who include many women, worked at local tea estates in the region Ninety-three workers have died and at least 200 others have been hospitalized in northeastern India after drinking toxic liquor, officials said Saturday, in the latest case of alcohol poisoning in the country.The deaths in Assam state came less than two weeks after tainted liquor killed about 100 people in the northern states of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.""The number of dead (in the district) has now increased to 58, and another 75 people are undergoing treatment"" in local hospitals, Dhiren Hazarika, deputy commissioner of Golaghat district in Assam, told AFP.Another official from the neighbouring district of Jorhat said that 35 people had died there after consuming a batch of ""spurious liquor.""Hazarika said people started falling sick after consuming a batch of illegally produced liquor late Thursday.The victims, who include many women, worked at local tea estates in the region. The death toll could rise further as both officials said some of the afflicted were in a critical condition.""The people came to the hospital with severe vomiting, extreme chest pain and breathlessness,"" doctor Ratul Bordoloi, joint director of Golaghat's health department, told AFP. Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal has ordered an inquiry.State police said they had arrested one man for selling the liquor, and authorities said two excise department officials were suspended for failing to take adequate precautions over the sale of the alcohol.Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma told AFP that state authorities had collated ""at least 80"" deaths in the districts. ""But apart from this some more people died outside the hospital,"" he added.""I also met the family members and relatives and ensured them that the perpetrators will not be spared,"" Sarma said in a Twitter comment.Some media reports, citing anonymous sources, said that more than 100 people had died and the exact number was still being verified by authorities.Cheap, locally made liquor is common in parts of rural India and bootleggers often add methanol - a highly toxic form of alcohol sometimes used as an anti-freeze - to their product to increase its strength. If ingested in large quantities, methanol can cause blindness, liver damage and death.Hundreds of mainly poor people die each year in the South Asian country from tainted liquor, which normally costs just a few US cents a bottle.Of the estimated five billion litres of alcohol drunk every year in India, around 40% is illegally produced, according to the International Spirits and Wine Association of India.Many Indian states have implemented or pushed for prohibition, which, according to critics, further increases the unsupervised manufacture and sale of alcohol.","['died', 'india', 'told', 'toxic', 'kills', '200', 'drinking', '93', 'victims', 'liquor', 'hospitalized', 'alcohol', 'deaths', 'district', 'women']","Indian people arrange the bodies of victims who died after allegedly drinking toxic bootleg liquor in Assam's Golaghat district on February 22, 2019.

Why is drugged driving commonplace in Dhaka?,"According to transport owners, a large number of Dhaka&rsquo;s drivers and their assistants, who operate around 50,000 public transport vehicles, are drug addicts",Nawaz Farhin Antara,2018-09-07T21:57:04+06:00,"According to transport owners, a large number of Dhaka’s drivers and their assistants, who operate around 50,000 public transport vehicles, are drug addicts Over half of the commercial drivers in Dhaka take drugs regularly, transport owners and leaders have alleged.Stakeholders say drugged driving, a common habit among drivers of commercial vehicles and transportation workers, is leading to road accidents in many cases.However, drivers claim they need drugs to maintain concentration through high temperatures, constant shouting by passengers, and long working hours. According to transport owners, a large number of Dhaka’s drivers and their assistants, who operate around 50,000 public transport vehicles, are drug addicts. However, they said the number is decreasing gradually.Although no specific study is available about the number of drug-addicted drivers in Bangladesh, the Accident Research Institute (ARI) at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) analysed data for 1998-2014 obtained from the Bangladesh Police. The analysis shows a downward trend regarding addicted drivers.“As per the data, about 10% of drivers use drugs,” ARI Assistant Professor Kazi Md Shifun Newaz said.“However, the numbers are still very low and not realistic, as private organizations have found the rate of drugged drivers stands around 80%.”Bangladesh Sarak Paribahan Malik Samity General Secretary Khandaker Enayet Ullah said the rate of drug usage among drivers and helpers was 50% only a few years ago. He said following the incidents of violence and harassment against women on public transportation, they assigned 50 teams to conduct awareness campaigns among drug-addicted drivers and staff. “The tendency has now reduced to 35%-45%,” he told the Dhaka Tribune.The availability of drugs at bus terminals, truck stands, and bus stations is a common reason behind the high number of drug users.“The drivers and helpers take drugs before starting their journey, which in many cases leads to accidents,” Enayet said.Mozammel Haque Chowdhury, general secretary of Passengers’ Welfare Association of Bangladesh, attributed the situation to the government’s failure to install detection methods.What makes transport workers dependent on drugs?Drivers said they take drugs to deal with constant fatigue and depression.“Passengers use abusive language with drivers, even put pressure on them to drive fast, even on busy street,” Mozammel said.“That makes drivers confused and angry. They also drive for 15 to 18 hours a day. So they take drugs to stay awake till the end of their duty.”A driver, wishing to remain anonymous, told the Dhaka Tribune that drivers feel dizzy in the afternoon, and they also need drugs to deal with the constant heat of Dhaka.“Most of us drive vehicles for 12 to 16 hours a day though the labour law limits the timeframe to eight hours,” he said.“The higher working hour keeps us under constant pressure. Also, there are pressures from other sides—like reaching the destination on time and making extra trips. We also face pressure from the passengers. Drugs help us tackle these pressures.”Psychiatry Professor Dr Md Tazul Islam from the National Institute of Mental Health said drugs give drivers a little relief for their bodies amid huge pressure.“Their temporary energy and relaxation do not allow them to drive normally; so they remain high on drugs and face accidents,” he said.No detection strategy for yabaIt is possible to detect alcohol use among drivers, but Bangladesh does not yet have a detection mechanism for yaba.Sarak Paribahan Malik Samity leader Enayet said proper drug detection machines should be introduced immediately to make the roads safe for all.“Most of the drivers and helpers are now taking yaba, cannabis, and phensedyl. So, focus should fall on addressing the issue immediately,” he said.Buet Prof Shifun Newaz said: “Police cannot detect drug users because of the lack of availability of special drug-detection machines. Also there is an insufficient number of police required to enforce detection.” Enayet said there are also too few skilled drivers.“It is estimated that around 2 million drivers are needed across Bangladesh and 200,000 are needed in Dhaka,” he said. “We have repeatedly requested our members not to hand over their vehicles to drug addict drivers, but maybe they are doing it because of a shortage of drivers.”Department of Narcotics Control Director General Jamal Uddin Ahmed said they will purchase drug identification equipment (detection machines) in the next fiscal year.What the law saysBangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) is responsible for punishing addicted drivers.According to the road transport law, if someone drives, or attempts to drive, a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs – to the point that that they fail to have effective control over the vehicle – they will be punished.  First offences mandate imprisonment of up to three months, a fine of up toTk1000, or both.For a subsequent offence, drunk or drugged drivers face imprisonment of up to two years, a fine of up toTk1,000, or both. The driver’s licence shall also be suspended for a specified period.BRTA (Training) Director Md Sirajul Islam said: “It is not possible to deal with the issue legally only. So we conduct regular training sessions to make drivers aware not to take drugs.”","['drugged', 'driving', 'transport', 'drug', 'drugs', 'bangladesh', 'number', 'vehicles', 'road', 'detection', 'drivers', 'commonplace', 'drive', 'dhaka']","Stakeholders say drugged driving, a common habit among drivers of commercial vehicles and transportation workers, is leading to road accidents in many cases.
