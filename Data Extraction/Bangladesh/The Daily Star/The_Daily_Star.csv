Serenity in the South China Sea,"The central, painful reality that the US must accept is that a major shift in the Asia-Pacific balance of power has already taken place. The days of America's unequivocal primacy and unilateral capacity to write the rules are over.",Gareth Evans,2015-07-03T00:00:00+06:00,"Diplomats and alcoholics don't always have as much in common as is sometimes assumed. But there is useful guidance for policymakers in the Reinhold Niebuhr prayer that Alcoholics Anonymous has made its own: “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.”America's response to China's rise – and in particular to its assertiveness in the South China Sea – is a case in point. The United States should accept many dimensions of China's economic, and now military, growth with as much serenity as it can muster. But there are some that call for pushback, and the jury is still out on America's capacity to make the right calls.The central, painful reality that the US must accept is that a major shift in the Asia-Pacific balance of power has already taken place. The days of America's unequivocal primacy and unilateral capacity to write the rules are over.Economically, the writing is on the wall. Despite US opposition to China's Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank, much of the region has embraced it. And, again despite US resistance, it seems inevitable that the renminbi will join the International Monetary Fund's reserve-currency basket. Then there is the immense difficulty the US is having in bringing its China-excluding Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact to fruition.Militarily, while the US will remain the dominant global power for the foreseeable future, its absolute superiority in East Asia is no longer unchallenged. The dramatic build-up of China's military (especially naval) capability is no more than can be expected of a hugely trade-dependent regional superpower. It is not easy for some US leaders to say so publicly, but most acknowledge privately that America can no longer expect to have the seas and skies to itself. Its role will necessarily be scaled back to that of regional counterweight.But how far should serenity extend when it comes to the South China Sea? This is the most sensitive geopolitical issue looming over Xi's state visit to the US in September. China has been stretching the limits of regional (and US) tolerance with its expansive sovereignty claims and massive land-reclamation activity – some 2,000 acres in the last 18 months – on Fiery Cross Reef and elsewhere. Pushback is required, but within defined limits.What critics of China's land reclamation need to understand is that, even without any credible sovereignty claims to the sea area in question, or any islands within it, under international law China does have the right to build artificial islands and installations, including airstrips, on outlying reefs and shoals. The Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia have been doing so for years in the Spratly Islands, albeit on a smaller scale. Although such installations must be for “peaceful purposes,” that does not necessarily exclude some military presence, provided the intent is non-aggressive.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  The US cannot stop such activity and should not try. What it can do is make clear that reclamation activity does not, by itself, provide a foundation for any new sovereignty claim or exclusionary activity. The reclaiming country can set a 500-meter “safety zone” around such installations. That is all. China cannot claim a 12-mile territorial sea or a 200-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ); nor can it put in place an air defense identification zone or any other kind of military exclusion operation. And the US is within its rights to make this point by flying surveillance aircraft to within 500 meters of such installations.As for China's broader sovereignty claims, again some distinctions are necessary. To the extent that these claims are based on the “nine-dashed line” – embracing some 80 percent of the South China Sea and described as China's “historic waters” – the entire international community should reject them out of hand. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) – now generally accepted as customary international law even by countries that, like the US, have failed to ratify it – is the only credible framework within which any kind of exclusive claims can be made.On the other hand, to the extent that China's claims are based on long use or occupancy of particular habitable islands in the Spratly or Paracel groups or elsewhere (and as such consistent with UNCLOS, to which China is a party), they may be as credible as those of other regional players, if not more so. So the US and other outsiders are right not to take sides about competing claims, and to urge that they be resolved by negotiation or international adjudication, not by force.Pending resolution of these competing claims, it is also appropriate, in the course of asserting the right to freedom of navigation, that the US and others treat as a de facto sovereign exclusion zone a 12-mile perimeter around such islands. After all, if they are not owned by China, they are owned by someone. As with the reef installations, the wise course is to minimise provocation.On the issue of freedom of navigation, China should be believed when it says that it is not in the business of obstructing commercial shipping or flights anywhere in the South China Sea. But it has created difficulties for the US – and a continuing risk of inflammatory incidents – by insisting that, within the entire 200-mile EEZ extending beyond its territorial waters, no military ship or aircraft has a right to engage in surveillance and intelligence collection.American pushback on this front, though justified, should be tempered. In the interest of defusing tensions, the US should scale back its monitoring activities within China's EEZs and rely more on less obviously intrusive means.Managing the US-China relationship in general, and the South China Sea in particular, requires, above all, keeping official rhetoric under control. Lines will need to be drawn, but wise leaders will focus on cooperative diplomatic solutions, playing military cards to the minimum extent possible – and perhaps repeating to themselves, the AA serenity prayer before creating expectations that they cannot meet.The writer was Foreign Minister of Australia 1988-96, co-chaired the International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament 2009, and is author of The Responsibility to Protect: Ending Mass Atrocity Crimes Once and For All and co-author of Nuclear Weapons: The State of Play 2015. Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2015.www.project-syndicate.org ( Exclusive to The Daily Star)","['right', 'sea', 'international', 'china', 'zone', 'military', 'islands', 'claims', 'chinas', 'south', 'serenity']","The dramatic build-up of China's military (especially naval) capability is no more than can be expected of a hugely trade-dependent regional superpower.

Voices of the Youth,I once read an article about how our generation falls victim to a modern phenomenon called “Facebook Image Crafting”.,,2016-07-15T00:00:00+06:00,"I once read an article about how our generation falls victim to a modern phenomenon called “Facebook Image Crafting”. This involves presenting only the good parts of your life on social media so that people secretly aspire to be as good looking and successful as you are. Today we grow up under an unrealistic pressure to excel in our professional and personal lives. Often, we fail to meet the expectations of society, our parents, or ourselves, and when we do, we crumble. We become vulnerable to a point where our entire life seems like an empty void. We become desperate to find a greater purpose for life. Desperate to find a cause we can believe in and rally for. And that is where religious extremists tap in. They “enlighten” these lost souls about this amazing cause, the “Jihad” that not only gives their life a purpose, but also promises the greatest reward of all, the Jannah. Perhaps, the recent phenomenon, not only in Bangladesh, but across the world is a wake up call for us to redefine what expectations we communicate to our youth. Should we ask them to focus only on their grades, wealth, and career, or should we encourage them to live for a cause such as alleviating poverty, fighting global warming, making the world a better place? Perhaps, if we guided our youth to channel their energy into a bigger cause, they would be spared the need to seek solace and purpose in religious extremism.AnonymousCo-founder of an online StartupThe Bangladesh we grew up in was always so warm- so accepting of each others' beliefs and so generous in sharing each others' happiness. So what went wrong? How did we accumulate so much hate and negativity?In search of answers for these questions, I called the one person I bombard with all my problems and queries: my mother. While I went on a rant on how I hate the evil Islamists manipulators who are trying to make puppets out of our youth, my mother immediately declared that I had tunnel vision and I needed to see the more pressing social aspects to this problem. The first thing she told me was that our society has become way more pessimistic and bitter than it ever was before. She told me that instead of judging people and finding things to bring them down, we need to start complimenting each other. She also told me and I quote-'we need to stop discouraging people'. People with ambitions have started to draw a lot of negative remarks from society. Thirdly she claimed 'We need to start treating all children like we treat our own. We need to love them like our own'. Watching someone or someone else's child achieve good things in life should make us happy; not negative and judgmental. She told me we need to cut back on all of these negative habits that are lethal for our society and make a better environment for our children where they feel more protected than they do right now. A society from which they will learn to love- not to hate. A society that makes us all responsible for each others' lives. It is needed more now, during these trying times for humanity, than ever before.AnonymousHealth Advisor, Priceline Pharmacy Australia It is very appalling that these days extremist outfits have started recruiting from high profile schools, colleges and universities whereas earlier recruits were mostly supplied from madrasas. Moreover, university teachers, professionals and members of wealthy and influential families have fallen into traps of such terrorist schemes. It is frightening that these people who enjoy more acceptance and influence over a large part of our society have turned into weapons of destruction. I think these people are becoming easy targets of the terrorist groups because many of them have very little knowledge about rich Bengali culture of diversity, folklore heritage, Islamic tolerance, shared histories and traditions of thousands years. Taking chance of their detachments or deviation, terrorists brainwash these people with revisionist narratives of heavenly rewards and fantasies of martyrdom. As a consequence, they learn to hate Jews, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists and other non-Muslims. My suggestion to tackle this growing menace is to develop strong security architecture and efficient counterterrorism policy. Besides, we need to understand diverse social relationships among communities to promote interfaith dialogues and communal harmony. On the other hand, we should remove hateful expressions from academic literature and misinterpretations of Holy Scriptures while the textbooks should incorporate alternative literature on tolerance, diversity and pluralism.Rakibul HasanYouth Activist, researcher and Women Deliver FellowPhoto: Prabir DasThe news of Gulshan attack came to me as an utter horror. I trembled with fear and the idea of peace became alienated to me. Now, after about two weeks of the attack, as I have had more time to think about the situation, the fear has spread even more. I do not feel safe on the roads that I walk every day, the restaurants I visit every morning or with the classmates who I meet in university every week. The awful trait of stereotyping has started to grow on me. I do not know who is innocent and who may share the same ideology that drove the terrorists that day. It is so, because I realise that such an attack is not a rogue case, but a result of the deeply rooted socio-cultural aspects of the youths in Dhaka. It is not today that the misunderstanding of religion and blind faith has been injected into us. Rather, the elements that play a part in instigating radical extremism, such as manipulative pseudo religious contents and the practice of teaching pseudo religion in both Bangla and English medium educational institutes have existed from long ago. Because of this, even though the attack in Gulshan was the first time that Bangladesh has seen such an intricate assault, we have already witnessed a similar attempt in Sholakia on Eid day and I cannot assure myself that more incidents will not take place in near future. While it is unavoidable to live without fear and caution, I do not think we are crippled just yet. I believe that with informed actions and responsible decisions, the terror in Bangladesh can be halted before it fosters to be an epidemic. AnonymousStudent and freelance photographerPrivate University in DhakaThey say 20 people died. But I say, in some corner, a part of us died too. The turbulence of the atrocious act hit us too. Hence, now more than ever, we need to stay united. We need to foster the peace; we need to generate kindness, tolerance and nobility among ourselves. What we hear, see and feel should make each of us a better person who knows the importance of respecting every other person, despite their religion, gender, colour. Lastly, we need to keep dreaming the Bangladeshi dream. We need to remember our responsibility for making our homeland better.AnonymousThird year Student of Asian University For Women    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  Statistically 10 percent of the best brains of this nation leave this country. There is no scope for creators, thinkers, innovators and this expands to even artists. A society enriches through diversity and mixing of minds. Our endeavor is to provide access to resources and opportunities to young innovators who can create solutions to nation's challenges. Eventually transform these ideas to social enterprises. These entrepreneurs will not be taking business as usual but will create a new paradigm of minds who will seek greater social equity through their work. Bangladesh has performed great in developing human development index. We however need a strong vibrant middle class who will stand up for the virtues of an inclusive society. I see us there in next decade. Talent itself is never enough. From education system to voicing opinion – we have never been given the platform to engage and nurture us. We do not have such a platform as yet, but we have to co-create it. We need to be heard and not by screaming, but by dialogues and acceptance.Saif KamalFounder, ToruThe main causes of this attack are manifold— these kinds of political murders have been happening for months now. Whose lifestyles or thoughts varied from the norm received threats and were killed in public— there was no step from the government or the police to strengthen security or give support to those who faced such danger. Added to that, a culture of corruption and regressive state policies (chastising anyone who shares his or her thoughts, making writing about homosexuality illegal etc.) persists— we have the perfect climate for such crimes to take place, because then we get to think that we can get away by conducting these crimes, and we do! This is clearly not even close to the “secular democracy” that our constitution boasts of. As a society, we must practice more tolerance and acceptance of different views, when it comes to different matters such as religion, gender, lifestyle, etc. Educationists must revise how religion is taught in the classroom. There is only rote learning, but no analysis, for which young people might fall prey to dominant oppressive ideologies. Different interpretations of religion must be welcomed in class, along with critical reading of religious texts, in order to create an intellectual space among youths and teachers, and not have one authoritative interpretation to grow a sense of respect and mutual understanding that can foster nurturing spaces for dialogue and critical thinking. This approach has to be applicable in all realms of communications actually, among parents and children, siblings, friends, etc. Any war or police crackdown won't root out militant or fundamentalist ideologies, but an intellectual culture would, so that fascism of any kind can be resisted.  The damages of the aftermath of any terrorist attack are greater than the actual terrorist attacks. About Bangladesh, given the neo-liberal, capitalist nation that we are gradually emerging as, our approach to deal with terrorism has also begun to resemble other neo-liberal states such as India, USA… we are turning out to be a police state, with rigid surveillance tactics, which adds to the shrinking of democratic spaces. In such climate, it's easier for the State to regulate, profile and police any citizen, and accuse, jail and vanish anyone for that matter. Thus we need to ask who is the State really benefiting, who is it really working for? We MUST address these issues along with safety and security for the general people.AnonymousResearcher at an NGO, DhakaFor me it was very hard to believe that Bangladeshi youths could conduct such savage terrorist attack. It is the result of extreme radicalisation of our youth which happened due to their isolation from Bangladeshi society and culture. If we see the life history of these youths, it becomes very clear that most of them were frustrated at one point of their lives, they were seeking meaning of their lives and they had very little connection with the realities of the Bangladeshi society. These youths can easily find seductive messages of terrorist groups through the internet that promise them of the status of martyrdom, luxury in heaven and revolution in the world. This is how many youths, who mostly are from affluent families, are getting involved with hardcore terrorist activities. I believe mobilisation of youth through community activities is the best solution to this problem of radicalisation. Youth organisations for community activities should be formed and patronised so that young people can play active role in the social development. Thus they will be able to realise what should be their contribution to the development of their motherland. Nowadays young people are very career oriented and restless. Giving them the opportunity to work for different parts of the society should be the strategy to make them patriotic citizens of the country.”Mohammad Mamun MiaPresident, United Nations Youth and Students Association of BangladeshWe are in a system where difficult conversations are avoided, academic curriculum is archaic and the workplace is confusing. We don't have very good role models. We latch onto cricketers or social media commentary to provide us with direction in all avenues – from religion to workplace etiquette. It is a struggle to break out of what is prevalent and explain to young people about a different reality. We try to bring together young people from madrasa, Bengali medium schools and English medium schools to have a conversation and work together. We try to engage the young professional with the fourth-year university student. Our goal through this process is to develop a more tolerant, inclusive country, essentially a better country.   I think it will be pretentious to believe we have all the solutions. I think youth organisations in Bangladesh also need to look more closely into what they are offering, not only in terms of activities but also in terms of incentives. Why does someone choose to volunteer versus someone who does not? Are our success stories people who would be successes irrespective of our involvement? Are some people excluded from the kind of conversations we preach in our groups? Do we actively intervene to ensure there is diversity in our staff and volunteers, or do we take it as it comes? These are uncomfortable questions, but pertinent if youth organisations are to play an instrumental role in supporting young people in Bangladesh.Every country in the world undergoes a period of chaos before it establishes itself on a trajectory of consistent growth. Bangladesh has experienced remarkable growth in development, in women's rights, in healthcare, in bringing more girls in the classroom. However, Bangladesh still struggles politically, religiously and economically. In the next decade, I think our struggles will become more adverse, only to ensure we overcome our existing limitations and become better. I am an optimist in that regard, however I am cautious that the journey will not be easy.Sabhanaz Rashid DiyaFounder and PresidentOne Degree Initiative FoundationWe were so busy blaming madrasas, or other Islamic parties, that it created an opportunity for the extremists to target the affluent, who we never thought of giving any attention to. To shock and shake the nation, extremists chose the perfect target group. I don't think every one of those youths had the urge to do this; it was created in their mind slowly and gradually. According to me, two things happened simultaneously; one is lack of personal time with their families, and then radical thought positioning in their minds by the extremists. It takes time to build this level of isolation from society and the past. It's like transforming one's personality into a completely different one. I think the lack of openness with the family to talk about views- religious or not, their thinking and mindsets, their logic, these lackings fuelled the recruitment. These kids that turned into monsters did not share their new experiences, new transformations or new 'friends' with their families, making it easier to poison their minds, without parental interference. It all comes down to democracy—the solution. Even if we don't have it in the country; we can have democracy in our homes. Parents shouldn't be imposing their ideas on children; rather they should be open to hear out what they are thinking and help them make decisions together. We need to create a world around them where we show our respect to each and every human, regardless of the religion, race, and gender. It's never too late to start such practices. Make the children participate in social activities that will flourish their hearts and souls- charity, animal welfare, rehabilitation programmes. If the extremists can poison them with radical thinking, then why can't we influence them with the positives in life? Equal treatment, respect and love need to be shown to each and every living being. Children learn from us, it's our duty we show them the right path. We need to talk about positive things, try to spread the good deeds with the people around us.AnonymousExecutive at a corporate companyDhaka","['young', 'religion', 'think', 'social', 'terrorist', 'bangladesh', 'society', 'need', 'youths', 'voices', 'youth']","It is the result of extreme radicalisation of our youth which happened due to their isolation from Bangladeshi society and culture.

Any follow up story would be appreciated. We wish a happy and peaceful life for Farzana.ZamanA very inspiring move by the young lady. The demand for dowry made by the husband's aunt proves that the so-called women-friendly laws aren't working. We need to change the attitude of dowry-seeking women and in this way end this evil practice. Imams can also help by letting people know that dowry is not allowed in Islam. In fact, Islam obligates the husband to pay a pre-arranged amount for the wife. This better system should be encouraged.Didarul AlamWe appreciating this bold decision from a conscious & educated woman. The term dowry has become a cancer. It is a curse of our society. Not only women but men also should come forward to eliminate this curse from society.

At that time, she was showing signs of puberty, but had not yet started her periods. Her remaining ovary failed at 15.Ten years later, she decided she wanted to have a baby, so doctors grafted four of her thawed ovarian fragments onto her remaining ovary and 11 fragments onto other sites in her body.Baby boyThe patient started menstruating spontaneously five months later, and became pregnant naturally at the age of 27.The gynaecologist who led the treatment to restore the patient's fertility, Dr Isabelle Demeestere, said it was now hoped the procedure could help other young people at risk of ovarian failure, especially given there is an increasing number of long-term survivors of haematological diseases diagnosed in childhood.Dr Isabelle Demeestere led the treatment to restore the patient's fertility. Photo taken from BBC.""However, the success of this procedure requires further investigation in very young pre-pubertal girls, as our patient had already started puberty even though she had not started menstruating,"" she explained.She also warned that it would only be suitable for patients at high risk of ovarian failure, due to risks such as damaging the removed healthy ovary or reintroducing malignant cells at the time of transplant.Professor Adam Balen, chairman of the British Fertility Society, welcomed the news.""One would anticipate that young ovaries should have lots of eggs in them, the concern was whether those eggs might develop to maturity, if the ovarian tissue was taken at such a young age and frozen and then re-implanted,"" he told the BBC.""So, this is proof of that concept... it's very important information.""About 40 babies have already been born across the world using frozen ovarian tissue taken from older women.","['removed', 'young', 'ovarian', 'frozen', 'childhood', 'tissue', 'using', 'ovary', 'baby', 'age', 'treatment', 'woman', 'started']","A woman in Belgium is the first in the world to give birth to a baby using transplanted ovarian tissue frozen when she was still a child, doctors say.

The ABC's of bullying,"Areeba Binte Sadiq was nervous on the day she stepped into her new school. Experiencing mixed emotions, she secretly nurtured the anticipation of quickly making new friends, and blending in with ease. Yet, deep down the fear 'what if it does not work' was also very real.",,2018-09-04T00:00:00+06:00,"Part One:  The victimAreeba Binte Sadiq was nervous on the day she stepped into her new school. Experiencing mixed emotions, she secretly nurtured the anticipation of quickly making new friends, and blending in with ease. Yet, deep down the fear 'what if it does not work' was also very real. Being a pragmatic person, her expectations were low. The first week went by with mere introductions, exchange of smiles while crossing in the corridors, but nothing went beyond the “hi-s and the hello-s.”Desperate for companionship, she took the effort to befriend her peers.What followed in the course of time was something straight out of Areeba's worst nightmares.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  Remember the chubby boy who was always at the receiving end of all our school jokes? Or the boy who preferred to befriend girls more than his male peers, simply because he preferred the female companionship?What about the girl who did not meet the teenage perception of beauty and grace — 'the proverbial ugly duckling?' Or how about the girl who was in and out of relationships; while one ended and another started, the whole school was abuzz with rumours and 'slut-shaming?'All these children — the bullied and the bully — still exist in every classroom of every school. Is one of those children yours?Bullying is certainly not a new phenomenon, but with changing times its very nature has evolved into something more sinister, and often results in consequences beyond belief. Letting it go unchecked can make such experiences reach grievously epic proportions.The onus to teach our children empathy in a world that is getting crueller by the day lies heavily on our shoulders. However, the first and the foremost step that we need to take as a society is to make enough noise to create an awareness of this menace, under whose weight an innocent soul's confidence is getting crushed with each passing minute. HER STORYZara was one of the popular girls at Areeba's school. Beautiful and charming coupled with an excellent academic record, she had an influence on the 'popular crowd,' and as Areeba puts it, Zara had taken a dislike to her — “from day one!”Maybe without even realizing and possibly with no malicious intent even, Zara's disdain for Areeba spread among her close friends, and slowly amongst the other groups, no matter how small or large.Desperate to avoid any confrontation, Areeba isolated herself during lunch breaks, the only time she was not cushioned by the watchful eyes of the teachers and the administration.As part of her defence mechanism, Areeba dissociated herself from all company. While all the other children laughed and played, she sat alone in a lonely corner of the courtyard or the school library. This too soon became the opportune moment for the other female students to harass Areeba, and within a few weeks, the boys joined in too.As Areeba puts it, there were students who realised what was happening, and maybe also felt sorry for her, but it was always a look of pity, rather than an honest display of empathy.As weeks turned into months, the bullying took a whole new dimension. With every passing day, Zara and her peers became increasingly intimidating and at one point the muffled comments gained voice and to Areeba, it felt that everyone at her new school was her foe.The day Areeba's dark complexion transcended from being a passing comment to racial slurs, she could no longer put on a brave face for the world and came home crying with a broken heart and a crushed spirit.The biggest irony of situations such as these, and as unbelievable as it may seem, is that in many cases parents are either completely unaware of the struggles faced by their child at school or feel completely helpless in resolving the situation.In this case, to say that Shabana Sadiq was unaware of her daughter's plight at school would be incorrect, but initially she felt helpless and feared becoming a parent 'that complains too much' thus adopting a wait and watch attitude.It was only when Areeba came home crying from school did she realise that 'enough was enough.' Shabana finally decided to involve the school authorities. Did she wait too long letting her child suffer all this time? This one question haunts Shabana till date. RECOGNISING THE WARNING SIGNSGlobal statistics show that maximum bullying incidents take place in schools. The very classrooms and playgrounds that we deem safe for our children can cause untold miseries to them at the hands of none other than their peers. Even though the perpetrators can be anyone from teachers to staff, in most cases the bullies are children themselves.Laila Khondkar, Director, Child Rights Governance and Child Protection, Save the Children in Bangladesh feels, “Communication is the most important aspect of effective parenting. Children who fear approaching their parents with a problem, will in all likelihood hide any bullying issues they face, but if parents are able to build a friendly and loving environment in the house, ensuring the child of their unconditional love and support, then it makes it easier for children to confide in them which is the first step to tackling the issue of bullying.”She further added, “It is essential for parents to be patient listeners to whatever their children have to say. And reinforce to them that it is not their fault that they are being bullied. The bullies are wrong in doing so.”Although observant parents and teachers should be able to identify a case of bullying, present day realities in our nuclear existence, single parent households, or even simply the struggle to make both ends meet, often make this a tall order!Even the most prestigious private schools of the country are now enrolling beyond their limit, and while some do become achievers in the future and become flag-bearers of the school, the average grades are dropping fast. DEALING WITH BULLYING“Some of the signs that your child is being bullied will include, primarily, a reluctance to go to school, regularly returning home with torn, damaged or missing possessions, complaining about having no friends or very few friends, losing interests in activities that they once enjoyed and constantly being left out from group activities in school,” Khondkar said.The most visible red flag in that direction would be a fear of riding the school bus, a sudden drop in grades, and total apathy towards studies.Laila Khondkar feels that when parents realise that their child is reluctant to confide in them, it is best to initially avoid a direct approach. Instead, one should try probing into the child's activities at school and find out more about his/her friends, who s/he sits with at lunch or who s/he likes or dislikes. One should also be reminded that as a parent this should be subtle to never seem to the child as a probable invasion of his/her privacy.Holding dinner table conversations about bullying and how it is not the victims fault, may lead the child to open up to you. If the information you get sets off your parent alarm it is best not to react overtly. Just assuring your child of your absolute support in helping him/her get through this situation will provide the much-required boost in confidence. It is important to empower the child and encourage him/her to stand up for him/herself. Strong comebacks at times work great with bullies; looking them in the eye and telling them you are not scared of them, takes away the power of that bully to hurt you.Although an eye-for-eye may seem like the best option for the sufferer, be warned that many a times open confrontations might lead to bigger problems. If, however, the bullying takes the form of physical assault, no time should be wasted to take stern actions.When to lodge an official complaint is also at times a tricky decision. Empowering a child getting bullied is not always enough, but it is also important that the bullies are held accountable for their actions.Today, it is possible for children who are bullied to go through therapy which will not only boost their morale, but help them find a smooth, amiable solution to the problem. This can have a tremendous positive effect on the child. Stories of one-time bullies becoming good friends is not unheard of!Another helpful step a parent can take is to try and increase the child's network of friends so that s/he does not feel isolated, which is one of the primary repercussions of being bullied. Building stronger familial bonds among siblings and cousins should also be encouraged.Bullying can have a long-term negative impact on an individual and prolonged bullying can leave deep scars, some which never heal. It is best to nip it in the bud.A consolidated effort between parents and school authorities with regular counselling of the children involved and positive reinforcements from all quarters can ensure that the situation does not go out of hand.It has been a while since Areeba went through that devastating episode. Although she has now been able to build her own circle of friends, Areeba prefers to stay silent regarding the tormenting episode. Even as it seems that Areeba's wounds have healed, yet clearly the scars remain. And the most disheartening aspect of the whole affair —Areeba is probably one of the lucky ones!The fear of being bullied, or becoming labelled as a bully, is so deeply ingrained in the mindset of the parents and the children themselves that all interviewees wished to remain anonymous. All names used in the entire series of articles have thus been changed upon their request. We would like to express our sincerest thanks to all those who were brave enough to narrate a traumatic experience they do not wish to relive. Star Lifestyle also thanks Laila Khondkar, Director, Child Rights Governance and Child Protection, Save the Children in Bangladesh and Dr Helal Uddin Ahmed, Associate Professor, Dept. of Child Adolescent & Family Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health in helping us with their valuable insight.THE EVIL THAT ISBullying can be termed as the intentional use of force by an individual to intimidate, coerce or abuse another person. It can be carried out in different ways and at different levels of severity. It can be verbal, social, or even physical. From being called names, being teased and humiliated, to being ignored and left out; from having lies being spread about a child to his/her possessions being hidden or forcefully taken; from being threatened and/or intimidated to being pushed around or being harmed physically.Widely considered a severe violation of child rights, bullying often leaves long term negative impacts.  It can severely disrupt the ability to learn and often becomes an impediment for a child reaching his/her full potential.Children who are bullied at school, coaching centres, or even at the city's last remaining playgrounds suffer from lower self-esteem than their peers who are not. Specialists also note that these individuals do nurture a feeling of worthlessness. They harbour feelings of exclusion and feel isolated from society.From the point of view of protecting child rights, creating a harassment free environment should definitely be given priority. In public health departments we suffer from what is called double burden of a disease, which is to say, that as an under developed nation, where we are still struggling to address communicable diseases, yet lifestyle issues have already emerged.We are experiencing the same problem of double burden with child protection issues. As of now we can barely cope with child marriage and child labour, but problems like bullying have already taken a foot hold within our society. We should not and cannot afford to give preference to one childright issue over another, simply because ultimately they are all negatively affecting our children.","['bullying', 'school', 'abcs', 'areeba', 'friends', 'children', 'parents', 'parent', 'child', 'bullied', 'day']","If, however, the bullying takes the form of physical assault, no time should be wasted to take stern actions.

Jamaat a bar to 'greater national unity',"BNP's longstanding ties with Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami has emerged as an obstacle to its move to forge a greater unity with other political parties, aimed at realising its demands ahead of the national election, likely in December.",Mohammad Al-Masum Molla,2018-09-28T00:00:00+06:00,"BNP's longstanding ties with Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami has emerged as an obstacle to its move to forge a greater unity with other political parties, aimed at realising its demands ahead of the national election, likely in December.Bikalpadhara Bangladesh (BDB), a potential partner in the unity process, has already made it clear that BNP must cut its ties with the Islamist party before the BDB build any sort of unity with the BNP.The BDB, led by former president Prof AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury who is a former BNP leader, has also asked other parties not to share the stage with BNP if it does not sever its relations with Jamaat, which opposed the country's independence from Pakistan in 1971.An alliance of eight left political parties is also against any unity process if Jamaat is directly or indirectly involved.The issue also came up at a 20-party alliance meeting at BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia's Gulshan office last night.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  In response, Jamaat leader Abdul Halim said they wanted the unity to happen at any cost and that the BNP could make any decision to make that happen.“If we are an obstacle, keep us aside from the unity process. But we want unity at any cost,” a source quoted the Jamaat leader as telling the meeting.At the meeting, alliance members requested BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir to complete the unity process at the soonest.But Fakhrul did not make any comment at the meeting participated by members from all the alliance partners, according to two sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.The BNP-led four-party alliance was formed in 1999 where Jamaat was a key partner. Jamaat is with the BNP since then. Jamaat was also in the 2001-2006 government led by the BNP. In 2012, the four-party alliance was expanded to a 20-party alliance.At a programme at Mahanagar Natyamancha on Saturday, Gonoforum President Dr Kamal Hossain and BDB President Badruddoza Chowdhury announced that they would work together to have the greater unity with other political parties. Several top leaders of the BNP and its allies (other than Jamaat) also shared the stage along with representatives of some small parties and civil society members.But in a joint meeting of Juktafront and Jatiya Okiya Prokriya (national unity process) of Dr Kamal on Tuesday, the BDB made its position clear that there cannot be any direct or indirect alliance with any anti-liberation party or individual.Led by the BDB, Juktafront is a four-party alliance, which was formed late last year. Other members of this alliance are Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Janata League, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD) of ASM Abdur Rob and Nagorik Oikya of Mahmudur Rahman Manna, who quit the Awami League in 2009 as its organising secretary.Talking to The Daily Star, BDB Joint Secretary General Mahi B Chowdhury, who is Badruddoza Chowdhury's son, said they wanted to join force with BNP, but for that to happen the party had to leave the Jamaat.Communist Party of Bangladesh (CPB) President Mujahidul Islam Selim gave a similar view.However, Dr Kamal, who quit the AL in the 1980s and formed Gonoforum in 1992, and the other partners in the Juktafront said they had no problem to be in the unity process with the BNP.“We are now trying to forge a greater unity and Jamaat will not be a barrier to the unity process. The important issue now is the greater unity among the people and also the political parties. This is why we are focusing on it,” Dr Kamal, also convener of Jatiya Oikyo Prokriya, told The Daily Star.Manna, convener of Nagorik Oikyo, echoed this view. “Jamaat is not a big deal at all for our unity process.”Asked, BNP leaders said Jamaat was not a registered political party. So Jamaat does not exist as a party and therefore it cannot contest elections under its banner. As a result, Jamaat is not an issue here.The 20-party combine is a separate alliance and that the greater unity process, whose objectives are totally different, should be seen as such, they added.“Our focus is to forge a greater unity and we are working to achieve that goal,” Fakhrul told The Daily Star earlier in the day.Referring to the demands of other political parties for polls under a nonpartisan interim government, Fakhrul said the left leaning political alliance and some other parties have been calling for a greater unity to restore democracy in the country.“Even civil society members and other social organisations raised the same demands. So we are trying to form a greater unity with all the political parties and in this case Jamaat is not an issue,” Fakhrul added.BNP leaders said they were keeping distance from Jamaat for the moment to make the greater unity a reality.The party has been criticised at home and aboard for its relations with the Jamaat.Asked, a Jamaat leader said, “We also want greater unity. We are in the 20-party alliance and we want to keep it intact. If the BNP wants to forge a separate alliance with other parties, they can do it and we welcome it.”Against this backdrop, the BNP is expected to hold a rally in the capital tomorrow. Other leaders in the unity process said they would set their next course of action, including formation of a liaison committee for the unity process, after BNP's programme.Keeping this in mind, the BNP has decided to hold the programme under its own banner, and not under the banner of the 20-party alliance.At the rally, the party will place a seven-point demand for the government to meet before the election.Dr Kamal floated his Jatiya Oikya Prokria on August 2016, about a year after the formation of Juktafront.Earlier in July this year, eight left leaning political parties formed an alliance styled “Left Democratic Alliance”.They all demand polls under a nonpartisan government, dissolution of parliament before the election schedule is announced and deployment of army during the election, among other things.Initially, the Awami League, and also party chief and prime minister Sheikh Hasina welcomed the unity process.However, the ruling party started to come down hard on the leaders of the unity process in recent weeks after they shared stage with the BNP and spoke of forging a “greater national unity” against the AL.","['parties', 'bdb', 'alliance', 'party', 'process', 'unity', 'national', 'bnp', 'jamaat', 'political', 'greater', 'bar']","An alliance of eight left political parties is also against any unity process if Jamaat is directly or indirectly involved.

CEC moves to heal rift with commissioners,Chief Election Commissioner KM Nurul Huda has finally moved to end his “go alone” policy that used to leave the four other election commissioners in the dark while running the EC.,Rashidul Hasan,2018-10-09T00:00:00+06:00,"Chief Election Commissioner KM Nurul Huda has finally moved to end his “go alone” policy that used to leave the four other election commissioners in the dark while running the EC.The move came on October 2 when the Election Commission Secretariat in an office order said there were deviations from rules and regulations in running the activities of the EC secretariat and the four commissioners noticed that. The EC directed the authorities to run the secretariat's activities in line with the rules and regulations, the order added.Before the issuance of the order, the CEC on the same day had invited the commissioners to tea at his office room. Sources at the EC have confirmed The Daily Star the issuance of the order.Distance had been growing between Huda and other commissioners over the former's “unilateral decisions” on different important activities.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  The rift came into the open after the four election commissioners last month had sent “unofficial notes” to the EC secretariat expressing their disappointment at its functions.The four election commissioners are Rafiqul Islam, Mahbub Talukder, Kabita Khanam and Sahadat Hossain Chowdhury.EC sources said distance between the CEC and the commissioners widened over holding of the 9th meeting of the Forum of the Election Management Bodies of South Asia in Dhaka on September 5 as the election commissioners' opinion about the event was not sought.None of the four election commissioners took part in a training workshop of EC officials in the capital's Nirbachon Bhaban on September 22 as they were “not informed” about the programme. The CEC was present at the event.Besides, opinions of the four election commissioners regarding the important workshop ahead of the upcoming general election were not taken. The next parliamentary polls are likely to be held in late December.  Some election commissioners alleged that the CEC and the EC secretary took some important decisions and carried out some activities avoiding them.The commissioners also sent “unofficial notes” to the EC secretariat pointing that some EC rules were being violated in running the EC's activities.“All decisions of the Election Commission should be taken on the basis of majority opinion. In many cases this rule was not followed,” an official of the EC secretariat quoted an “unofficial note” as saying.In the “unofficial notes”, the commissioners said as per rules, they were supposed to know about all the EC decisions. But the commission took several decisions after receiving the CEC's approval and they were not aware of those.The election commissioners also asked EC Secretary Helaluddin Ahmed to produce all important files of the commission before them. They also wanted to know about the EC's election preparations, different activities of its secretariat and its various projects, sources said. Talking to The Daily Star on condition of anonymity, an election commissioner yesterday said he didn't know anything about the EC's proposal to buy electronic voting machines (EVMs) worth Tk 3,800 crore. Another commissioner said he was in the dark about the field level visits of election officials ahead of the upcoming national election and several other election-related issues. “Journalists often question us about different activities of the election preparation, EVM project and visits of election commissioners. But I cannot answer them [journalists] as I am in dark about those issues.”He said he asked the EC secretariat to inform him about the commission's functions.The present election commissioners, led by the CEC, had taken office in February last year.Sources at the EC said Election Commissioner Mahbub Talukder in July last year first sent an “unofficial note” regarding a reshuffle in the EC secretariat.On August 30 this year, he wrote a note of dissent on the EC's proposal to seek amendment to the Representation of the People Order for using EVMs in parliamentary polls.","['cec', 'election', 'rules', 'decisions', 'ec', 'heal', 'order', 'moves', 'unofficial', 'activities', 'rift', 'secretariat', 'commissioners']","The rift came into the open after the four election commissioners last month had sent “unofficial notes” to the EC secretariat expressing their disappointment at its functions.

School's Disciplining Students: Couldn't care less,The tragic death of a ninth-grade student of the city's Viqarunnisa Noon School & College on Monday appalled and enraged all and sundry.,Al-Amin,2018-12-05T00:00:00+06:00,"The tragic death of a ninth-grade student of the city's Viqarunnisa Noon School & College on Monday appalled and enraged all and sundry.The tragedy, according to many students and parents of the school, was a case of excesses on the part of the school authority when handling a case of alleged cheating in the annual tests by the 15-year-old girl, who would go on to hang herself in her house after watching her parents being subjected to severe admonishment by the power that be.The offense of the girl, a student of science group, was that she broke the rules by carrying a cell phone in the exam hall. She was reportedly copying from images of her text book pages which were stored in the cell phone while sitting for the Bangladesh and Global Study exam on Sunday when she was caught and then expelled.Everything appeared to be guided by the book till that point.But when she came to school with her parents the next morning with a plea for mercy made to the morning shift-in-charge and then to the principal of the school, it was rejected. Not only that, the request to sit on Monday's examination was also rejected by the principal, who even threatened (if not a veil threat) to give her a TC.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  This whole exercise was unbearable for the adolescent girl, who had been under tremendous stress for the last couple of days. She ran off from the principal's room to her home in Shantinagar, which was not far away, shut the door of her beloved room before choosing to take a path of no return.Did the punishment fit the crime? Was the high-handed approach by the school authority absolutely imperative when the general practice in the very school was to allow the students to sit for the remaining exams irrespective of a pending decision?Many students and parents believe that the tragedy could have been easily avoided had she been allowed to sit for the next exam. The logic behind it was it could have allowed her to recover from the stress-related anxiety.But the approach cost a vibrant girl, who was a keen follower of South Korea's famous pop band BST or Bangtan Boys and someone proficient in six languages other than her mother tongue, her life. This incident also indicates that our teachers are not trained to tackle adolescent offences. They seem to follow the path of strict regimentation when modern education system has absorbed the idea of educating teachers about the stress-related issues of the students.On the culture of a type of rat race to be at the top prevailing in schools, Dr Mahjabeen Haque, chairperson of the Department of Educational and Counseling Psychology of Dhaka University, said “Children experience cognitive, emotional, social and physical development but it does not happen at the same pace for everyone.Due to the differences in developmental period, it creates a lot of stress for the children which becomes difficult for them to cope with. This is something that families and educators need to take into consideration but this is something that many don't do.” When children make mistakes, sometimes they need psychological support to rectify those mistakes, added Mehjabeen, also an associate professor of the department. She also said that while conducting a pilot project on counseling teachers and students of different renowned schools in Dhaka, they got a good response. However, when the issue of formally starting such a project came up, the top schools, including Viqarunnisa, refused.Prof Shalahuddin Qusar Biplob, chairman of Psychiatry department of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, refused to talk about this particular case since he was not fully aware of the details of the incident. But he spoke in general terms regarding the stress-factor of students.“In our education system, there is no mechanism to identify stress and neutralize it,” he told The Daily Star yesterday.None of the three major stakeholders -- family, school and administration -- were conscious about a student's stress and its management, he added.Biplob, also the editor of mental health magazine Moner Khabor, said it was a good sign that discussions on the issues had already started and Dhaka University had recently launched a department in this regard.Teaching is not just about imparting lessons. Unfortunately, we are focusing on a tunnel vision instead of looking into the boarder picture of education. If we, including teachers and parents, don't change, we run the risk of another tragedy sooner rather than later.","['disciplining', 'couldnt', 'school', 'university', 'sit', 'stress', 'girl', 'tragedy', 'schools', 'parents', 'students', 'teachers', 'care']","Many students and parents believe that the tragedy could have been easily avoided had she been allowed to sit for the next exam.

3 more women accuse Bill Cosby of assault,,,2014-11-22T00:00:00+06:00,"Bill Cosby at a news conference last week about an exhibit at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art that features a collection from him and his wife, Camille. Photo: AP  Three more women have come forward with allegations against Bill Cosby, reports The Huffington Post.Carla Ferrigno, Angela Leslie and Louisa Moritz are three of the 11 women who have now publicly identified themselves and accused Cosby of assaulting them in some form.Ferrigno, Leslie and Moritz's claims join a growing list of allegations made against the 77-year-old actor.In 2005, Andrea Constand filed a lawsuit against Cosby claiming that he drugged and molested her in 2004. Not long after, Tamara Green went on the “Today Show” alleging she had a similar experience with Cosby. Twelve other women were anonymous witnesses in the Constand case, claiming they also had similar encounters with the comedian. One by one these women have come forward to publicly identify themselves, including Barbara Bowman, Beth Ferrier and, just days ago, Therese Serignese who spoke at length with The Huffington Post. Other women to recently make their allegations against Cosby public include publicist Joan Tarshis and supermodel Janice Dickinson.Carla Ferrigno, actress and wife of actor Lou Ferrigno, alleges that Cosby attacked her in his home in 1967 and attempted to force himself on her before she escaped. “He walked over to me and grabbed me, pulls me really tight to him, kisses me on the mouth, like really rough. And I just took my hands and I pushed him away,” Ferrigno told KFI radio station.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  Model and actress Angela Leslie says Cosby sexually assaulted her in a Las Vegas hotel room in 1992, telling the New York Daily News, “With his hand on top of mine, [Cosby] had me massage his penis.”Louisa Moritz, a former actress best known for her role in the 1970s show “Love American Style,"" claims that Cosby sexually assaulted her, forcing her to perform oral sex on him in a green room in 1971 before going on the Johnny Carson's ""Tonight Show,"" TMZ reported.Cosby’s attorney, Marty Singer, responded to Ferrigno’s allegations in a statement to The Huffington Post. “This continuing pattern of attacks on Mr Cosby has entered the realm of the ridiculous, with a purported ‘forceful kiss’ at a party in 1967, nearly 50 years ago, being treated as a current ‘news story’ and grossly mischaracterised as a ‘sexual assault.’ This is utter nonsense.”“People coming out of nowhere with this sort of inane yarn is what happens in a media-driven feeding frenzy,” Singer added.The Huffington Post subsequently reached out for further comment on Moritz and Leslie's claims, but had not received a response at the time of publication.CARLA FERRIGNOCarla Ferrigno told KFI radio station on November 20 that she went on a date with a friend of Cosby's in 1967. She claims that he invited her to the comedian’s house after their dinner to meet up with Cosby and his wife Camille. After about 10 minutes, the two couples went to the movies, and then returned to the Cosbys’ home to play pool.Once back at the house, Ferrigno says that both her date and Camille left the room as Cosby and Ferrigno played pool. Immediately after the pool game ended, Ferrigno claims that Cosby grabbed her.“He was much bigger than me. Much bigger and he pulled me so hard and so rough. I had never been treated so roughly and he pulled me hard to him so hard,” she said on KFI radio station. “And then kissed me so hard, right in the mouth. No one has ever been that physically violent with me. I was stunned. I was frozen. I took all my body strength and used both of my arms to stop him and push him away from me. He was so forceful.”ANGELA LESLIEAngela Leslie told the New York Daily News that she was an aspiring actress when the 30-year-old met Cosby in 1992, when a driver “delivered” her to the comedian in his Las Vegas hotel suite. Once in the room, Leslie claims that Cosby told her: “If you want to act, show me what you’ve got. Pretend you’re intoxicated.” She says that he then offered her a drink, which she tasted and declined, because it was filled with alcohol. “Then he asked me to go into the bathroom and wet my hair. I walked back out, and he had removed his clothing and gotten into bed,” Leslie said.She said the comedian pulled her into bed and put lotion in her hand. “With his hand on top of mine, he had me massage his penis,” Leslie said. “He masturbated with my hand. I wasn’t pulling back. I was in shock.” After a while she said Cosby became bored and told her to leave, telling the New York Daily News, “I didn’t drink the alcohol, and maybe since I didn’t pass out, he decided to get rid of me.”LOUISA MORITZLouisa Moritz claims Cosby sexually assaulted her in 1971 in New York’s NBC Studios. Now 68, Moritz tells TMZ that she was waiting in the green room for an appearance on the Johnny Carson’s “Tonight Show” when Cosby came into the room. She said he told her he was impressed with her work and ""implied that he was going to see to it that I will become a major star through his direction,” Moritz told TMZ.“Suddenly [Cosby] approached me and took out his penis, which was now in the line of my face and pressed up against it,” she said. ""He took his hands and put them on the back of my head and forced his penis in my mouth, saying, ‘Have a taste of this. It will do you good in so many ways.’” Before walking out of the green room, Moritz recalls Cosby saying to her: ""Now you don't want to upset me and the plans for your future, do you?""Although the statute of limitations for any sexual assault committed in 1971 would have expired, Moritz told TMZ she still plans to file a civil lawsuit against Cosby.Cosby was set to star in his own Netflix comedy special and a new NBC show, both of which have been since been postponed or canceled.KRISTINA RUEHLIKristina Ruehli, who says she was one of the anonymous Jane Does set to testify in Andrea Constand's 2005 lawsuit against Cosby, spoke to Philadelphia Magazine. The 71-year-old claims that in 1965, at age 22, she met Cosby while working as a secretary at a talent agency. She says Cosby invited her to a party, and when she showed up, it was just the two of them. ""He proceeded to pour some bourbon,"" she told Philadelphia Magazine. ""I drank a bourbon-and-7 at the time. I could really hold my liquor. I'm Irish. And I had a couple of those -- just two -- and then I just don't remember much."" She now believes that he drugged her.According to Ruehli, her next memory was being in Cosby's bed: It was all foggy, and I woke up in the bed. I found myself on the bed, and he had his shirt off. He had unzipped his pants. I was just coming to. He was attempting to force me into oral sex. He had his hand on my head. He had his cock out, and he had my head pushed close enough to it -- I just remember looking at his stomach hair. And the hair on his chest. I had never seen a black man naked before.And it never went past that. I immediately came to and was immediately very sick. I pushed myself away and ran to the bathroom and threw up.RENITA CHANEY HILLRenita Chaney Hill, now 47, told CBS Pittsburgh that she met Cosby in Pittsburgh when she was a 15-year-old model in the 1980s. She was cast in Cosby's “Picture Pages,” a series of educational TV segments, and was in contact with the comedian over the next four years. Hill also now believes that Cosby drugged her on more than one occasion, insisting that she drink when she was underage.“One time, I remember just before I passed out, I remember him kissing and touching me and I remember the taste of his cigar on his breath, and I didn’t like it,” Hill told CBS Pittsburgh. “I remember another time when I woke up in my bed the next day and he was leaving, he mentioned you should probably lose a little weight. I thought that odd, how would he know that? I always thought it was odd that after I had this drink I would end up in my bed the next morning and I wouldn’t remember anything.” CBS Pittsburgh reported that Hill told them she does not remember whether Cosby forced sex on her, because she was drugged. She claims she cut off contact with Cosby when she was 19.The Huffington Post reached out to Cosby's lawyers regarding the claims made by Hill and Ruehli, but at time of publication had not heard back.","['bed', 'assault', 'remember', 'room', 'told', 'leslie', 'cosby', 'women', 'moritz', 'ferrigno', 'accuse', 'claims', 'bill']","Photo: APThree more women have come forward with allegations against Bill Cosby, reports The Huffington Post.

He also admitted to the involvement of two other former Rab officials, Lt Col Tareque Sayeed and Lt Commander Masud Rana.  He gave hair-raising descriptions before the court of Senior Judicial Magistrate KM Mahiuddin of how and where the seven were killed,” Fazlur Rahman, additional public prosecutor, said before a Narayanganj court during a remand prayer for Lt Col Tareque.Following the hearing, Senior Judicial Magistrate Ishtiaq Mohammad Siddiqui granted the police a further 5-day remand to interrogate the dismissed army official.Various sources closely linked with extracting the confessional statement from Arif told our Narayanganj correspondent that Arif admitted the entire operation was carried out on the orders of a top Rab official. The sources wished to remain anonymous on grounds of professional and personal safety.The Rab official's name is being withheld because The Daily Star could not obtain the copy of the confessional statement to cross-check it.Arif also gave the names of eight other Rab men, ranging from officers to constables, who were linked with the gruesome murder.However, he said the entire plan was masterminded by Nur Hossain, according to the sources.Narayanganj city panel mayor Nazrul Islam and his four associates and senior lawyer Chandan Sarker and his driver were abducted allegedly by some members of the Rapid Action Battalion on April 27. Their bodies were found floating in the Shitalakkhya river a couple of days later.In his statement, Arif said Chandan had videotaped the abduction of Nazrul and his men in front of Khan Saheb Osman Ali Stadium at Fatullah on Dhaka-Narayanganj Link Road. So, they picked up Chandan and his driver as well and killed them along with the other five.The sacked Rab officials are shown arrested in two murder cases filed by Nazrul's wife and the family of Chandan Sarker.When The Daily Star asked the superintendent of Narayanganj police about Arif's confession, Khandaker Mahid Uddin avoided a direct reply and said, “Since Arif is confessing, the investigators have the responsibility to ensure that the evidence is credible”.During Tareque's remand hearing, advocate Shakhawat Hossain, president of Narayanganj Lawyers' Association and counsel for the investigators, stated, “All the allegations we have made so far have been proved true through Arif's confession”.These Rab officials were acting as hired assassins, he argued.Despite Arif's confession, none of the progress reports submitted to the High Court by four agencies probing the incident case mentions the former Rab officials' involvement in the abductions and murders.“I have read out the important portions of four progress reports on the investigations into the incidents before the High Court, but I have not found any mention that any Rab official is involved in the incidents,” Attorney General (AG) Mahbubey Alam said this at a press briefing at his office yesterday.Earlier, he submitted before the HC the reports prepared by the inspector general of police (IGP), the director general (DG) of the Rab, the Criminal Investigation Department of police and the seven-member committee headed by an additional secretary of the public administration ministry.After accepting the reports, the HC bench of Justice Md Rezaul Haque and Justice Gobinda Chandra Tagore directed the probe committees to submit reports on further progress before it on July 9.Citing from the CID report, the AG told the HC that the CID officials have recorded statements from two witnesses in connection with the alleged involvement of the Rab officials in the incidents, and they are now scrutinizing their statements.The CID also said in its report that 13 persons, including three former Rab officials, have been detained and are being interrogated in connection with the incident.The Rab DG said 56 Rab and police personnel have been interrogated to find out whether they had any negligence in discharging their duties or any link with the incident.The report of the IGP said the members of the victims' families are being given full-time police protection, and the investigation officer of the case is continuing investigation into the incident.The seven-member committee said in its report that the committee members are recording statements from the witnesses of the incidents.Meanwhile, State Minister for Home Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal yesterday said, “There has been progress in the investigation of the Narayanganj seven-murder incident.

The respondents included social workers who deal with these cases, lawyers, eye-witnesses and 195 child sexual assault survivors themselves.Of those who self-reported their cases, 31 were rape survivors—but none of them had ever sought legal support or police help. 22 of these survivors, including 12 male respondents, never told anyone about it—neither family nor friends. When asked why, most of the survivors said they were ashamed. “No one will understand, and I allowed the same thing to happen to my younger brother. I didn't understand that it wasn't okay,” writes another male survivor who was raped at the age of eight by a domestic helper.And an even more terrifying one by a female respondent, “I was raped by my father. I did not want my parents to separate.”What if the survivor had reported the incident? How would the system have protected her? One nine-year-old girl told her mother that her stepfather had raped her. In fact, she told her mother that she was raped several times. Her parents separated alright, but now the mother-daughter duo is living in abject poverty. The mother, a Quranic teacher, whose face is always hidden under a niqab, mustered up the courage to take it to court. She faced her daughter's rapist at a courtroom last Friday and broke down in tears when he was granted bail. Clutching a prayer mat like a talisman, the white-robed, bearded man, who had walked into the courtroom in handcuffs, left without them.“My lawyers did not show up because I could not pay them,” the mother sobbed at the injustice of it all, “I also need to fight for my denmohar without which I cannot survive.” She was crying so much that she was barely incoherent.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  Photo: Kazi Tahsin Agaz ApurboThe younger you areThe same thing happened with three-year-old Tuni at court. Tuni, which is a pseudonym to protect the identity of the survivor, was even younger when she was raped by her family's landlord. The accused rapist Latifur stood in the dock scowling, while Tuni's tearful father Lokman pleaded for the rapist's bail to be cancelled. The hearing came to a quick and unfavourable end for Lokman because of two reasons: the investigating officer of the rape did not include the forensic doctor's certificate and Tuni herself was not present.“She is so young. How do I bring her to court to face her rapist?” says Lokman, pointing out a flaw of the courtroom, “I myself am scared of facing him.” The Child Act 2013 mandates that courtrooms be child-friendly. Tuni has not yet forgotten about her rape. “Uncle hurt me down here,” says the girl, clutching between her legs, when asked what her uncle did to her. “He gave me bakarkhani to eat,” she goes on. Her medical reports detail heartbreaking particulars about the state of her tiny body as a result of the incident. “After the rape, the place was inflamed and she kept crying and wetting herself,” says her mother describing the child's trauma.Tuni's hearing was being held at the Dhaka Magistrate Judicial Court, while the family had fled to Kishoreganj district; they commuted four hours each way to come to court. “We moved to Kishoreganj right after the incident because Latifur threatened to 'finish' us unless we shut up. I do business in the Dhaka area, where we used to live, so I run into him often, and he pressurises me to withdraw the case,” adds Lokman, “that is why it was important for us that his bail be cancelled.”The younger the child is the less likely they are to seek institutional support from the police or social workers. Of the people who came forward to participate in the survey, there were only two narrated incidents where the police were involved if the child was under eight years of age. In both cases, the victims were raped. Compared to that, there were eight cases reported to the police for victims who were older. One 17-year-old even sought legal support for cyber sexual harassment. Another male survivor told a social worker about the time a maternal uncle tried to rape him. Nasrin Akter Joly, Deputy Director of Girl Child Advocacy Programme, narrates an incident to show how it is difficult to gather evidence for younger victims. “In Shyamoli, a five-year-old girl was sexually assaulted by an older male domestic worker from another apartment. The police questioned the girl to get detailed information about the event, which was traumatising for her so she could not properly provide information,” says Joly, “The elder brother beat up the perpetrator out of frustration, and for this offence, the family was harassed by the police and they had to leave their apartment eventually.”Tuni looking out at Dhaka City. image: Kazi Tahsin Agaz ApurboThe poorer you areWhen asked about involving the police, a staff from Social and Economic Enhancement Programme, an organisation working with street children, said: “We do inform the police but not often because these [incidents] are deemed insignificant [by the police].” The interviewee's reluctance to seek help from the police is ominous because street children are undoubtedly the most exposed to sexual violence. “Almost all the children we rescued from the streets were sexually assaulted, but only one case was picked up by the media,” states Forhad Hossain, the Executive Director of Local Education and Economic Development Organisation (LEEDO), “we do not have the organisational ability to prove that abuse happened, so we don't report to the police.” Over 200 kids he dealt with in the last three years were under eight years of age.Social workers who deal with street children were interviewed separately for some more precise numbers on how many such cases they encountered and in which areas, from 2015 to 2017. Unsurprisingly, the major transport centres and entry-points of the city had the highest number of cases—these include Sadarghat Launch Terminal, Arambagh Bus Terminal, Gulistan and Kamlapur Rail Station. 11 of the social workers interviewed by Star Weekend worked in those areas, and between 2015 and 2017, they encountered as many as 526 children who were sexually abused. It goes without saying that the actual number is higher—much higher. In fact, 526 is only slightly less than the annual national approximate that media reports circulate. In the past three years, another organisation, Breaking the Silence, dealt with hundreds of cases of child sexual abuse but only five or six were reported in the media.Aparajeyo Bangladesh's Executive Director Wahida Banu has a personal story about the dangers of under reporting by the media. “A policeman was dragging away a street child in handcuffs outside of Dhaka when our NGO worker intervened. The police threatened to harm him so he called a journalist for help,” she describes, “the journalist was just not interested and the child was carried away in handcuffs.” While such a small-scale incident does not reach larger Dhaka-centric national newspapers, local community media can really play a part, Banu thinks.The other group who can never report sexual violence against them is the massive fleet of underage domestic workers hidden away in city apartment blocks. We interviewed teachers who run centres for these children in residential neighbourhoods and they all had stories to tell. Beginning from “the 70-year-old grandfather who made her give hand-jobs” to incidences of rape and murder, the one thing that these teachers claimed unanimously is that they cannot get the police involved.“The girls come to us for a safe haven. If we start calling the police on the employers then we cannot run these centres,” says a teacher. They chose to remain anonymous precisely because of that as well—if it comes to light that they have been talking to reporters then their centres might get shut down.“The parents or guardians of these girls too are difficult to convince—they have to choose between poverty and rape,” says an interviewee, “One time I called the sister of an eight-year-old girl who was being sexually abused, but she just assumed the girl was making excuses to get out of working.”“In another incident, a father of a child worker told me it is better than starving,” she adds.How do you monitor and report these hidden abuses where one party is clearly more powerful than the other? Housing societies and local civic associations like ladies' clubs need to step up, according to experts who work with child domestic workers. “Local area management committees exist everywhere and they can definitely play a bigger role in monitoring—maybe have someone designated to deal with gender violence,” says Nasrin Ahmed, who works with a child rights organisation.Nababganj Boro Masjid where Farhan was raped. photo: Kazi Tahsin Agaz ApurboThe less able you areBut it's not like local committees are always helpful either. They certainly did not report the rape of 17-year-old Farhan. Farhan, whose real name had to be concealed, has Asperger syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He vehemently opposes being categorised as disabled. “He just cannot concentrate on one thing at a time,” says his mother. Behaviour-wise, she categorises him as a child.“He was raped for five or six months straight at the Nababganj Boro Masjid. He used to come home and tell me that it hurts. Because he is like a child, he always told me whenever he was hurting,” says the mother. “Nobody would believe me—or him—and I had to watch my child go through this for months,” she says. “When I confronted the father of one of the rapists, he said that I was perverted for even having such thoughts.”“One used to show me videos on his mobile, while the other hurt me. They did it in the bathroom. I was on the floor. It was dark,” says Farhan, in short sentences punctuated by long silences.The mother never sought help from the government. “I'm tired of institutional help. I've been trying to get my son into a school for years, but he keeps getting turned away because he is not 'autistic enough'. On the one hand, he is too autistic to survive in a normal school. So I've pulled him out,” she says. She has never received visits from any social workers.Her chance came when Farhan was discovered in the bathroom with his rapists by Mohammed Saber, the head of a local association called Crescent Club, who saw the boys lead Farhan towards the second floor bathrooms and got suspicious. “Something about it felt strange—I just had a feeling. I followed them and found them inside a bathroom with the door locked,” he describes. He banged on the door and the boys came out.Now that there was an eye-witness, the mother alerted their ward commissioner Humayun Kabir. “Humayun is like my uncle and he told me to settle the matter internally, so I agreed,” she says. Why not tell the police and file a case? “I could not decide what to do, so I let the ward commissioner be the best judge of the situation,” she says.The rapists were brought to a public hearing and publicly beaten with shoes. Ever since the hearing, however, the mother does not let Farhan out of the house. She is afraid that because he is a rape survivor, others might also take their chances with him. Because he has never been through the system, he is yet to get tested for AIDS. The burden of proving it happenedAt the end of the day the burden of proving it happened falls on the survivors, and so, they don't speak out. “We consult lawyers about all cases of sexual violence, but cannot take action for all of them since many lack circumstantial evidence,” says Rukhsana Sultana, Executive Director of Breaking the Silence. In the past decade, the lawyers could only pick up cases of rape—all other categories of violence were brushed aside.As Farhan's case shows, if female rape victims are not taken seriously, then males are even less so. According to our survey, only 14 male respondents out of 67 revealed to friends or family that they had been sexually abused. In the case of females, nearly half of the respondents shared. This is made harder by the fact that perpetrators themselves usually originate from inner circles. According to our survey, the victim's uncle was involved in most of the incidents, followed by religious teachers, home tutors, cousins and staff at school—in that order. When children are up against adults who are allies with family and society, the courtroom and counsellor's couch moves further and further away. Star Weekend is very grateful to all survivors who shared their experiences. Rubana Mussharat and Sharmin Rashid contributed to the data collection. The survey was circulated on Facebook, including the women's group Meye: a Sisterhood.","['sexual', 'rape', 'raped', 'told', 'heard', 'seen', 'girl', 'children', 'workers', 'cases', 'mother', 'child', 'believed']","The respondents included social workers who deal with these cases, lawyers, eye-witnesses and 195 child sexual assault survivors themselves.

Further delay to make Padma bridge costlier,,,2012-07-07T00:00:00+06:00,"Delay, even by six months, in constructing the $2.9 billion Padma bridge might escalate the project's cost by 4 to 5 percent, said Prof Jamilur Reza Choudhury, chief of the technical evaluation committee for the project.“The longer the delay is, the costlier the construction will be. The bridge was scheduled to be finished between 2012 and 2016. If it now finishes between 2013 and 2017 the cost will obviously escalate,” he told The Daily Star on Wednesday.However, he said, the cost rise would be subjected to global development. “If there are huge construction works across the globe the prices of construction materials, especially of steel, would go up.The leading engineer of the country said some local agents of foreign bidders in the Padma bridge project had triggered the corruption issue by sending dubious letters and documents to the World Bank. “There was an unholy competition among the local agents,” he added.“I also got some anonymous emails, which I have submitted to the Anti-Corruption Commission. The companies who had failed to qualify sent numerous complains to many,” he said.Prof Jamilur is doubtful of the bridge's construction in the near future. He, however, sees China as the silver lining. “If the government can make a successful negotiation with China there could be a chance,” he opined.Asked how much the local agents were responsible for the WB's loan cancellation for Padma bridge, he mentioned Ventura International, local agent of disqualified China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC).“The documents and photos submitted in the official pad of CRCC were proven false. I later came to know that the owner of CRCC's local agent company had threatened the Bridges Division officials of jeopardising the project,” said Prof Jamilur.He said the agent had set up an office in China and used the official pad of CRCC, but the Chinese firm later disowned the agent when the forgery was exposed.Prof Jamilur said he had heard that the local agents tried to influence members of various committees of the bridge project, but failed.The members of the committees and the design consultant of the project AECOM-Maunsell had followed the WB guidelines and done everything accurately but the bank at some points directed and compelled them to change their decision which delayed the project, he added.He said five firms had qualified in the pre-qualification of the main bridge construction through bidding, which had both concrete bore piling and steel recking piling options. Later on WB's suggestion, the design was changed and only the steel piling option was kept leaving the option open for the qualified firms to hire a company with steel piling experience.“But the WB did not agree to that and pressed to float a fresh pre-qualification tender although for two months we had tried to make them understand that a fresh effort would not yield any positive result,” said Prof Jamilur, adding that the same five firms also qualified in the second pre-qualification tender.The qualified companies are: Samsung C&T Corporation of Korea, China Major Bridge Engineering Co Ltd, Daelim-Bam-VCI (a joint venture entity of Korea), Vinci-HCC (a joint venture of France and India) and China Communication Construction Company Ltd.At one stage, the WB started pressing for CRCC, which had been disqualified earlier.“Although we told the bank that the firm had failed to meet the criteria of steel piling, the WB repeatedly told us to collect more information from the Chinese firm,” he said, adding that the CRCC had sent some photos of steel piling of a bridge in China which, in fact, were of Auckland Bay Bridge in California.“As the fraudulence was exposed, the CRCC claimed that it had not submitted the photos although its local agent used the CRCC's official pads. Ventura International then wrote a letter to the Bridges Division withdrawing itself from the Padma bridge race,” said Prof Jamilur.About the construction supervision consultancy, he said five firms -- SNC-Lavalin, Oriental, AECOM-Mounsell, Helcrow and High Point Randal -- had been selected in two-envelop-system and following the quality and cost-based process prescribed by the WB. Marking of the technical quality was 90 percent while of cost 10 percent.At this the government formed a committee headed by the then Bridges Division secretary. When the task of the committee was almost done and it was about to submit its report, the committee was mysteriously dissolved. There were allegations that the local agents of the pre-qualified firms were making desperate efforts to influence the committee members, he said.“A new committee headed by me was then formed and we started evaluating the tender documents of the firms. SNC-Lavalin became the number one qualified firm in our extensive technical and financial evaluation,” said Prof Jamilur.He said the evaluation report was sent to the WB but the Canadian police raided the office of SNC-Lavalin just before the approval of the report. It eventually stalled everything.The WB, however, had no objection about the evaluation report, he added.On the alleged corruption in appointing the construction consultant, he said, “We know about a diary recovered by the Canadian police in which reportedly is a list of some people, including a [Bangladeshi] minister and other government officials, to whom SNC-Lavalin had pledged a certain percentage. But I think it's not the diary only as the WB would not do that [cancel the loan] based on a diary. There must be something else.”Asked whether the WB made a harsh decision, he said Bangladesh's economic strength is very poor and hence it cannot fight with a strong institution like the WB. “But China can. WB's policy for China is more flexible than that for Bangladesh.”Robert Zoellick, the immediate past WB president, had changed the bank's policy against corruption following China's warning that it would not borrow money from the bank, if there is any excess in the name of checking corruption, he pointed out.He referred to a provision of the WB policy where it is said, “Our policy will not be applied uniformly to all borrowers…it depends on the country condition.”Prof Jamilur, who is also the chairman of a 10-member international panel of experts to oversee the bridge design and that the environmental impacts were considered properly, said tender procedures of four other packages of the project were nearly completed. Of them, he said, the selection of a firm for the $160-million approach road at the Jinjira end of the Padma bridge was at the final stage.“Unfortunately, the Islamic Development Bank, which was supposed to lend $140-million for the project, refused to approve a firm that is recommended in our evaluation report due to the loan cancellation by the WB,” concluded Prof Jamilur.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['construction', 'jamilur', 'china', 'padma', 'bridge', 'piling', 'wb', 'steel', 'prof', 'costlier', 'local', 'delay', 'project']","Delay, even by six months, in constructing the $2.9 billion Padma bridge might escalate the project's cost by 4 to 5 percent, said Prof Jamilur Reza Choudhury, chief of the technical evaluation committee for the project.

We have paid a terrible price for this progress.”The bill fell short of achieving the ban on assault-style weapons sought by survivors. The gunman who opened fire at the school used such a weapon, an AR-15 rifle.Nevertheless, the bill raises the minimum age to buy rifles from 18 to 21, extends a three-day waiting period for handgun purchases to include long guns and bans bump stocks, which allow guns to mimic fully automatic fire. It also creates a so-called guardian program enabling some teachers and other school employees to carry guns.The NRA insisted that the measure “punishes law-abiding gun owners for the criminal acts of a deranged individual.”The Parkland gunman “gave repeated warning signs that were ignored by federal and state officials. If we want to prevent future atrocities, we must look for solutions that keep guns out of the hands of those who are a danger to themselves or others, while protecting the rights of law-abiding Americans,” Chris W. Cox, executive director of the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement.Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School attend a memorial following a school shooting incident in Parkland, Florida, US, February 15, 2018. Photo: ReutersThe signing marked a major victory for the teens who lived through the attack and swiftly became the public faces of a renewed gun-control movement. Just days after the shooting, they began holding rallies, lobbying lawmakers and harnessing the power of social media in support of reform.The governor told the students: “You helped change our state. You made a difference. You should be proud.”Scott, who said he’s an NRA member and will continue to be one, said he is still “not persuaded” about the guardian program that will let districts authorize staff members to carry handguns if they complete law enforcement training. It’s not mandatory.“If counties don’t want to do this, they can simply say no,” he said.The governor singled out two fathers whose children were killed, saying that they walked the halls of the Legislature since the shooting seeking change.“I know the debate on all these issues will continue. And that’s healthy in our democracy,” he said. “This is a time for all of us to come together, roll up our sleeves and get it done.”Student activists from the school called it “a baby step.”“Obviously, this is what we’ve been fighting for. It’s nowhere near the long-term solution,” said Chris Grady, a senior at Stoneman Douglas High. “It’s a baby step but a huge step at the same time. Florida hasn’t passed any legislation like this in God knows how long.”In schools, the measure creates new mental health programs and establishes an anonymous tip line for reporting threats. It also seeks to improve communication between schools, law enforcement and state agencies.Well-wishers place mementos the day when students and parents came for voluntary campus orientation at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School for reopening, in the coming Wednesday, following last week's mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, US, February 25, 2018.

Thank you very, very much. Thank you. (Applause.)This is a very real personal privilege for me to come to Bangladesh and walk into the Edward M. Kennedy Center. (Applause.) I know that Ted Kennedy holds a very special place in the history of Bangladesh and in the hearts of its people, of you. And the reasons for that are because he was very much a visionary and very clear about his support for the independence of your country back in 1971. And I knew Teddy for many, many years. I first met him when I was 18 years told, fresh out of high school, and I worked all summer – for free, I might add (laughter) – to try to help get Ted Kennedy elected to the United States Senate in 1962. And it was his first race. He was running to fill the seat of President John F. Kennedy. His brother had just been elected president two years earlier.And it was a great campaign. I learned a lot, enough to be able to get elected to the Senate not too many years later. And I never thought when I was doing that that I would one day become the junior senator, the junior colleague to Senator Ted Kennedy working in the Senate. We spent more than – just in to 29 years, a little less than that that I got to work with him. For the last few years he was gone. He had passed away. But it was a quarter of a century that I worked with him, and I am very honored to visit an institution that bears his name.And I might add, I think at the time he and I were the longest-serving junior/senior team in the Senate. I thought I was going to be there forever like that. (Laughter.) And Strom Thurmond, who used to be the oldest act with Fritz Hollings, he lived to be a hundred years old. So I kept saying, okay, a hundred, that sounds pretty good, I’ll take that. (Laughter.)There are many, many reasons why I wanted to come to Dhaka and why I appreciate so deeply the gracious reception that I received. And I am particularly grateful to the prime minister. I had a very good discussion with her. But I want to emphasize that the culture of this country is really one of the world’s most rich and diverse and beautiful. It is truly shonar bangla, a “golden Bangla.” (Applause.)And the prime minister and I had a very in-depth, thorough discussion – Foreign Minister Ali, other senior officials. And over the course of our discussions today, we had the opportunity to highlight how far Bangladesh has come in its four and a half decades since independence, and how much our countries now work together on everything from health care to education to regional and global security.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  I want you to know that the United States is very proud to have been a partner in Bangladesh’s growth, and we welcome this nation’s participation in all three of President Obama’s signature development initiatives: health care, food security, and the all-encompassing issue of climate change.Now, I know that at times there have been some who have felt a little tension regarding this relationship, and that came from 1971. But I am proud that not only did Senator Ted Kennedy support that, but as I said, I was just a young – in 1971 I was freshly out of college and just back from the war in Vietnam, and we were all supportive. Massachusetts was supportive of the struggle for independence in Bangladesh, and I’m very proud of that. (Applause.)Now, we know that we are living in a very different and a very complicated time. The areas of the world most vulnerable to climate change are heavily populated, low-lying coastal regions that are also subject to devastating storms such as cyclones and hurricanes. This places Bangladesh near the very top of the countries at risk, with an estimated 15 million people who could be displaced by 2050. And that is why the United States, President Obama, myself, others are working so hard with local partners in order to try to create climate resiliency, to support renewable energy projects, build emergency centers, help with many millions of Bangladeshis who are economically dependent on coastal resources.And as every one of you knows, the solution to climate change is not a secret. It’s right there for the grabbing. It’s energy policy. If you make the right energy policy choices, you solve the problem of climate change. Just today I talked with the prime minister and the foreign minister about the challenge of the Montreal Protocol and of being able to transition out of hydrofluorocarbons into the new technologies. And that alone will save us one half a degree centigrade in the warming of the Earth. So there are things we can do, and we need and want Bangladesh to be one of the countries that is at the top of the list of those who are fighting to make this transformation take place.Now, the United States, I promise you, will do all that we can to assist Bangladesh on this issue in the future, just as we have stood by you in so many challenges in the past. Since this country won its independence, the United States has provided billions of dollars to help Bangladeshis train more teachers, to modernize transportation, to improve health care, to promote the rights of workers and women, and produce food more efficiently. Meanwhile, our bilateral commercial ties have expanded so that America is now Bangladesh’s largest trading partner, largest export market, and a primary source of foreign direct investment.The $28 billion garment industry has played a uniquely important role in this rise, contributed to the annual sustained growth of your country at 6 percent. But growth in its own – growth just for its own sake is not our only goal. You can grow and grow and grow and grow, but you can be growing with the wrong values, you can be growing with the wrong outcomes, you can be growing with people not gaining in their rights or in their income or in their ability to get an education.So growth alone is not the measurement of all that is happening. The Rana Plaza collapse and the Tazreen factory fire before it are just two of the more recent tragedies that underscore a fundamental truth: Bangladesh cannot truly meet the aspirations of its people and share prosperity if its workers are not safe and their rights are not ensured. That is critical. (Applause.)And that is why the United States strongly supports efforts by government, by the private sector, by unions and the international agencies, in order to increase safety inspections, to close substandard factories, and make it easier for workers to be able to report violations without fear of retaliation.But these steps are only part of the story. Enhancing worker safety has to be paired with strengthening workers’ rights. The fact is garment factories across Bangladesh actually could benefit enormously from empowering laborers, allowing them to form labor unions, affording them full collective bargaining rights, because no one should ever be compelled to work in hazardous or exploitative conditions. It’s really that simple.Let me just share with you, when I – quite a few years ago, I lived in a community in Massachusetts in the northern part of the state called Lowell. And it had been built up. It was one of the first planned communities in America, and it was based on some of the Industrial Revolution and early development in England. But we had these huge, long factories along the river because the water was necessary to drive the mill, and they would produce textile and so forth.And it was huge for America. But young kids were working in there sometimes, and they couldn’t leave and have a lunch break. They couldn’t go have a bathroom break. They’d work 16 hours. Until finally, the labor movement insisted on creating rights and better working conditions for those people.And look at the United States of America today. We have grown to be the most powerful economy in the world. We are still the largest economy in the world. China is obviously growing. China has 1.3 billion people, so someday China will be a bigger economy. But we are still an economy of innovation, of creativity, an economy that gives people more rights, that allows young kids to be able to go to college, their parents do better and the next generation’s been able to do better. And it’s largely because we created the rights for workers and improved the working conditions, and we grew as a nation that understood that everybody benefits. And when everybody benefits, the nation does better. That’s the theory. We know this from our own experience. And so what we’re trying to do now is recognize it took a long time for this to happen. It wasn’t easy. Some of these changes have even happened in the last 15 years. And thanks to Senator Ted Kennedy and others, I was privileged to be there to vote for health care universally given to everybody in our country, and our country is stronger today because of it.But we’re still fighting for things. So my message to you is don’t – don’t get mad because it doesn’t happen overnight. It takes work and time. Building Bangladesh’s prosperity is important for its own sake, yes, and for the well-being of Bangladeshis, but there’s another reason as well. We all know that true prosperity is linked to a community’s sense of security, and that extremists thrive in places where people feel marginalized – economically, and marginalized politically, and that growth is much harder to achieve and to sustain in the face of violence. Money wants security. If you want to have foreign investors come and invest, you need security, but security also has to be built on the strength of your civil society and the strength of your people’s ability to be able to express their views and not feel as if the only place they can turn is to extremism in order to make a point.Now, for each of these reasons, the United States will continue to work very closely with Bangladesh and with partners on every single continent in order to defeat vicious terrorist networks, particularly those of Daesh and al-Qaida. Here in Dhaka, the July 1st attack at the Holey Artisan Bakery was an outrage clearly designed to divide Bangladesh, designed to try to cut off this welcoming society from the outside world. Dozens of smaller-scale attacks have been carried out during the past several years, often directed at members of religious minorities, foreigners, bloggers, and security officials. And the reason for this is obviously they want to divide you, they want to push people apart, they want to create internal strife.These heinous acts of violence, and too many others worldwide, are a stark, painful reminder that those who aid terrorist groups or perpetrate these acts have no respect for national boundaries, no concern for the rights of others, no regard for the rule of law, and they do not embody the values of the people of Bangladesh or the United States, or the majority of people across the globe. And it is important for us to make that statement. In Iraq, Daesh kills people because of who they are. It kills Yezidis because they are Yezidis. It kills Shia because they are Shia. It kills Christian because they are Christian. It kills people because they aren’t who they are and who they want you and will force you to be. They attack culture. They attack history. And that is why I describe the fight against violent extremism as one of the world’s most important challenges. And it will take a generation or more to solve it, but let me tell you something: We are defeating Daesh and we will defeat Daesh. We will defeat al-Shabaab and Boko Haram, and we are on the road to achieving that now.But we have to continue. It’s not just the battlefield; it’s the minds. And if we have too many young people who can’t go to school, or too many young people who are frustrated, or they can’t find a job – if we leave those minds out there for extremists to recruit, then it will continue and none of us would be doing our jobs if we allowed that to happen.Remember this: No country is immune from terrorism. It’s easy to terrorize. Government and law enforcement have to be correct 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. But if you decide one day you’re going to be a terrorist and you’re willing to kill yourself, you can go out and kill some people. You can make some noise. Perhaps the media would do us all a service if they didn’t cover it quite as much. People wouldn’t know what’s going on. (Applause.)The fact is we have to stand together, and the United States is standing with Bangladesh in this fight. (Applause.)Now, just as important, we understand that to defeat terrorists, we have to uphold, not betray, the democratic principles that we cherish and they abhor. There may be no single answer to the question of why somebody becomes a terrorist – there are a lot of reasons. But make no mistake, democracy still provides the most resilient and the most reliable platform that we have for preventing and responding to violent extremism. Why? Because when individuals can address their grievances, when you have an opportunity to come together and speak and not fear that you’re going to go to jail, when you have an ability to be able to talk and argue and fight over an issue, build consensus about facts – that’s the way that civil society is able to flourish: when people can freely participate in public debate and are less vulnerable to being subverted by lies, by distortions, by a fake presentation of a peaceful religion, Islam.So it’s important that people have a stake in building up their society, not being inspired to use violence to tear it down. Now some may argue that it’s more difficult to live up to the core values of democracy when countries face a genuine threat. And I understand that. But guess what? You can go in two directions. I believe that when a country faces those kinds of threats, it’s even more important to uphold the values of democracy. Because if you don’t, you will more quickly feed the frenzy that can come with opposition and panic and hysteria.My friends, I will leave here today with a very renewed sense of faith in the future of the relationship between our countries. I have no doubt about it. And while I wish I could come and stay for longer, the press of the current conflicts and the business that we have makes it extremely difficult to stay anywhere very long. Just ask my kids and my wife. It’s hard. But the energy of your vibrant, dynamic society is something I can feel, it’s something I understand. Our ambassador, who does a terrific job, has told me about it. My assistant secretary, Nisha Biswal, keeps talking about it. And they’re right. I will leave here with a stronger belief in the importance of this partnership to both of our countries.And I’m not sure that anyone would have predicted a decade ago that our countries would have been consulting closely on regional security, that Bangladesh would be using American cutters to patrol the Bay of Bengal, and that our shared agenda would include everything from counterterrorism to the environmental health and sustainability of our oceans, something we’re also working on together.At the same time, it should be no surprise that the United States and Bangladesh are not just partners in pursuing a common interest, but we are friends, as well. Back in – (applause). Back in 1971, when I was protesting a war and the men and women of this beautiful land were under murderous attack, some across the globe wanted to just look the other way. As I mentioned to you, there were a bunch of us in the younger generation who were involved in the civil rights movement and the women’s movement and the peace movement and the environment movement. It was a beginning of an extraordinary time of getting things done and putting new ideas and possibilities in front of our citizens. And one of the things that made me proud then was the way that Ted Kennedy stood up and fought for Bangladesh, and for what was happening here. (Applause.)At that time, when the violence was at its height, Senator Kennedy flew to this region. He visited the camps where refugees were gathered. And he returned home to the United States Senate to bear witness to what he called, I quote, “a systematic campaign of terror.” Early the next year, Senator Kennedy returned, and he planted a banyan tree at Dhaka University to replace the majestic one that the rampaging soldiers had destroyed. In his remarks to students at that time, Kennedy didn’t focus on narrow economic or strategic interests. Instead, he spoke of the connections that are deeper and bigger, more universal. He said, the real foreign policy of America is not just government to government; it is citizen to citizen, friend to friend, people to people. Because in a sense, we are all Bangladeshis, we are all Americans. We all share in the great alliance of humanity.The tree that my former Senate colleague planted remains a living symbol of the blood, sacrifice, and courage that brought this country into being. And it remains a symbol of the strength and of the friendship that the citizens of the United States and the people of Bangladesh share. It was to reinforce that friendship and to strengthen our bonds and our resolve to face the challenges now and in the future that I came to Dhaka today. And I look forward to working with all of you to accomplish that important mission to the benefit of Bangladesh, to the benefit of America. And if we do it right together, it will be to the benefit of the world.Thank you very, very much. (Applause.)MR TONER: We have time for a couple of questions. First question goes to Steve Herman of Voice of America.QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, Bangladesh Government insists that the increasingly sophisticated terrorist attacks that have been occurring here are primarily home grown. Analysts that my colleagues and I in the media have been speaking with recently beg to differ, and say that the Government of Bangladesh has its head in the sand about this. Do you agree, and is there anything concrete out of your visit here today towards enhancing the security relationship between Washington and Dhaka? SECRETARY KERRY: The answer is yes. Well first of all, the answer is I don’t believe that the Government of Bangladesh has its head in the sand. I do not believe that. We had a very candid conversation. I met with the home minister, I met with the law minister, I met with obviously the prime – the foreign minister, and we talked very openly about this. And we made it very clear, as you have just said in your question, that there is evidence that ISIL in Iraq and Syria has contacts with about eight different entities around the world, and one of them is in South Asia. And they are connected to some degree with some of the operatives here, and we made that very clear in our conversation. There was no argument about it. I think when the minister says, “home grown,” it’s not a foreign fighter who’s coming in to do it, it’s somebody here who’s chosen to do it. But that doesn’t mean it wasn’t influenced by elsewhere – on the internet, social media, and so forth. So the minister was very and the prime minister was very clear at the desire to cooperate with us very, very closely. We today agreed on additional steps by which our intelligence and law enforcement will work together in order to try to get ahead of this. And we talked about all aspects of it, including the importance of inclusivity, of working with people, of making sure that you protect the democratic process even as you come down tough on the perpetrators themselves. We think there’s much we can do to cooperate in that regard. We work already with the Bangladeshi police on community policing projects – now we’re doing that; with madrasah students to increase economic opportunities for vulnerable youth; with community leaders on conflict mitigation. So I’m confident that our assistance to Bangladesh will increasingly be designed to help the government address terrorism threats from domestic and transnational organizations. That’s the nature of the beast that we are dealing with today. And I am absolutely confident that we will build additional capacity and that it will be effective.MR TONER: Our second question, and last question, goes to Raheed Ejaz from Prothom Alo.SECRETARY KERRY: Yeah.QUESTION: Secretary Kerry, welcome for your first visit in Bangladesh. As you mentioned that we are dwelling in a very complicated world today and you mentioned on the upheld democratic values and other thing. While you came here, do you have any precise plan to discuss with the government officials here on the peace and stability and upholding democratic culture in the – not only in the Bangladesh, also in the Bay of Bengal, and want to see Bangladesh to take the permanent role here? Thank you.SECRETARY KERRY: Well, yes, we did. We talked about it in very broad terms. And we also talked it in some specific terms. As you know, we are providing, as I mentioned in my opening comments, cutters, which are being used for the patrolling of the Bay of Bengal, and we are convinced that there are a number of grassroots projects that we can engage in together that will help us to counter violent extremism. Prime minister will be taking part with President Obama at the UN in the refugee summit, and Bangladesh will be an important contributor to that dialogue.So I would just say to you that, not just with respect to the Bay of Bengal, but in all aspects, we have an extremely open and broad engagement with Bangladesh at this point in time. And the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund is a new project in order to help with these supporting grassroots efforts to increase communities’ ability to push back against extremism. Bangladesh is a pilot participant in that effort. So I think people can have confidence that, as a result of this visit today, we are going to follow up in a number of different ways that Assistant Secretary Biswal and the rest of our team have agreed are necessary over the days ahead. So I think you’ll see more activity and more engagement, and perhaps in the course of that, more presence.And I think our conversation regarding the nature of Daesh, Boko Haram, al-Shabaab, Jaysh al-Islam, Ahrar al-Sham, countless groups around the world – the nature of that conversation makes it clear that no nation can succeed without all of us sharing information, sharing best practices, sharing creative new techniques and approaches. The most – one of the most important weapons in this effort is communication between us. And as you know, the United States helped put together, and is leading, a coalition of 67 countries now that are all focused on dealing with violent extremism and fighting back against Daesh and these other entities.We have made significant progress. More and more now, I’m beginning to read the stories of how Daesh is feeling the pressure, people are escaping to get out and go back home or wherever. Now, that helps us solve the problem in Syria and Iraq, but it leaves us with a problem in these other countries where people go back to, or where the social media and propaganda of the group reaches out to. So our job is to fight on every front: on the financing front, the foreign fighter front, the communications front, the counter-messaging front, and particularly on the prevention front initially, so that education, jobs, fairness, transparency, accountability in society – all of those things are helping to give young people a sense of a possibility of a future, not a sense of futility and despair and frustration. That’s a huge differential in the fight against recruitment. And good governance, which all of you can demand, is as important as any other step that we take in this fight against violent extremism.So on that, I thank you. I am – again, apologize. It’s not a long visit, but I’ll tell you what, it’s a good visit and I really appreciate everybody’s generous welcome. Thank you. (Applause.)","['important', 'rights', 'speech', 'know', 'centre', 'united', 'states', 'kennedy', 'bangladesh', 'emk', 'john', 'minister', 'today', 'work', 'kerrys']","We all work hard, I think, at trying to build the relationship between the United States and Bangladesh.

PM's Comments in JS : Yunus Centre responds,"On Wednesday, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina responded to some questions raised by the members of parliament during the PM's question hour.

Those answers were reported by different newspapers the following day. In reference to some of the prime minister's comments made during the JS session, the Yunus Centre has sent the following 'rejoinder'. Here is what the Yunus Centre says:Many of these accusations have been made before and Yunus Centre has responded every time. Most of these allegations were made over and over again since 2011. They have been thoroughly responded to on each occasion. All national newspapers printed these responses devoting exclusive full pages in August, 2012. We are sorry that we have to repeat our responses once again. We are again laying out the facts against every accusation made by Honorable Prime Minister.Honorable Prime Minister: Yunus has lots of money but does not pay tax. He sues taxmen not to pay tax. He does not pay taxes on the huge amount he keeps in fixed deposits. We don't know the sources of his income. Where does all the big money come from? Yunus Centre:  The allegation of avoiding paying taxes is completely false. Professor Yunus always pays his taxes in full and without fail. He pays substantial amounts in taxes every year. Honorable Prime Minister has given false information to the nation from the floor of the Parliament. Professor Yunus never tried to avoid due taxes by making excuses. His tax files have been investigated repeatedly in order to find fault with them but every time it has come out clean.  According to newspaper reports all banks in the country were asked last month to give his and his wife's financial dealings with them. Nothing new came out of these bank reports either.There are three sources of Professor Yunus' income: 1) Speaking fees from the lectures he gives at various conferences around the world. He is one of the highly prized speakers in the global speaking circuit. This source of his income accounts for bulk of his income. 2) Royalties from his books published in over 25 languages. His books have been included in the New York Times bestsellers list, 3) Income from fixed deposits generated from items 1 and 2.Source of each receipt under items 1 and 2 are made available to tax authorities. So the question of not knowing the source of income does not arise.He remits his earnings from lectures and books back to Bangladesh through formal banking channels. All details are always given by the banks and are submitted to the tax authorities. To claim that sources of his income are not known to the government is not the truth. It would be very surprising to believe that relevant agency of the government did not brief the Prime Minister and inform her of the facts. If they did not do it so far even after the repeated concerns expressed from the highest level of the government about this information they should be taken to task for causing embarrassment to the Honorable Prime Minister for giving the nation false information on the floor of the parliament.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  Professor Yunus keeps his money in fixed deposits in the bank. He has never invested in stocks and shares. He does not own any share in any company anywhere in the world.  (It is incorrect to claim that he owns shares of Grameenphone). Not paying taxes on fixed deposits is again a meaningless allegation as tax on fixed deposit is paid at source. Since he pays taxes on all of his income that also includes income from the fixed deposits too. Tax authorities are always provided with all the details of his fixed deposits and all his other accounts.It is correct that he contested in the court regarding some tax claims made by taxmen. This legal action was needed from Professor Yunus because of sudden departure by the tax authority from a longstanding interpretation of a tax law applied in cases of all previous tax returns of Professor Yunus. In addition this change was given retrospective effect causing an enormous tax burden. Professor Yunus went to the court to seek redress for these claims.Honorable Prime Minister:  Muhammad Yunus is a “cheat” as he did not give Grameenphone profits to Grameen Bank in “breach of the promise he made before setting up of the telecom company”. Grameenphone, she claimed, was supposed to be a joint venture between Grameen Bank and Grameenphone. Dr. Yunus sold share of Grameenphone. He had turned Grameenphone into his personal property. About 30 percent of Grameenphone shares were in his hand and the rest was sold to others.        Yunus Centre: All government records in various ministries and agencies will show that the Honorable Prime Minister is wrong on all of these counts. The creation of Grameenphone went through a long series of formalities. None of the records of the government would bear the Prime Minister out. Here are the basic facts about Grameenphone:Grameenphone was born as a Joint Venture Company. Lead partner in this joint venture of Grameenphone is a Norwegian company, Telenor, which is owned by the Norwegian government. The second owner of Grameenphone is Grameen Telecom which is a non-profit company registered under section 28 of the Company's Act which has no private owner. Grameenphone is a publicly listed company. There are thousands of small shareholders of Grameenphone throughout the country. Because of Professor Yunus Grameenphone is the only telecom company in which 45 percent of ownership is in Bangladeshi hands including thousands of small investors. All other telecom companies are entirely foreign owned.Grameen Telecom borrowed money from Soros Foundation to invest in Grameenphone. At no stage did Grameen Bank own any share of Grameenphone.As mentioned before, all the documents of Grameenphone are available to the government. All information is available to the relevant government agencies.  These will show that Professor Yunus never owned any share of Grameenphone at any stage of the company, nor does he own any share now.  Therefore, the question of his selling shares to anyone does not arise. Similarly, since Grameen Bank did not own any share of Grameenphone at any time, the question of Grameen Bank selling shares of GP does not arise either. Grameen Telecom never sold any of its shares to anyone except in the case of selling shares to general public, as agreed by all partners of Grameenphone and the Government of Bangladesh.Grameen Telecom operates the Village Pay Phone programme to give poor women entrepreneurs the opportunity to sell phone services in the village. Grameen Telecom is the pioneer in the whole world in bringing telephone services to the poor, to the women in particular, and to the villages for the first time in telecom history of the world.  Hundreds of thousands of women made a good income from Grameen Telecom from its Village Phone Programme.  Because of the significance of this programme, it has been recognized as the milestone in the history of technology.  Grameen Telecom's Village Phone Programme is on display in the Glasgow Museum of Technology. As a nation we can take pride in having a place in the museum of technology. Because of the path breaking work of Grameenphone, telephone services today are so affordable. A mobile phone is now within the reach of almost all people in Bangladesh even in the remotest areas.Profits from Grameenphone that come to Grameen Telecom, a non-profit company, are used entirely for projects that support the welfare of the common people of the country through Grameen Telecom Trust.All documents relating to the agreement made at the time of formation of Grameenphone and also about the ownership structure of Grameenphone are publicly available and may be reviewed by anyone who is interested.Honorable Prime Minister: Following his defeat in the legal battle, Yunus got angry and he and an editor of a famous newspaper met with the World Bank President and also lobbied with Hillary Clinton to stop funding for Padma Bridge.Yunus Centre: It is to be noted that Professor Yunus exceeded 60 years of age during the last tenure of Awami League Government in 2001. But the government never raised the issue of Professor Yunus' age. Grameen Law does not specify any retirement age of the Managing Director.Bangladesh Bank never raised the issue of retirement age in their reports either during the eleven years. But the issue was raised in 2011. At this point Professor Yunus submitted a writ petition to the High Court. The court refused to accept the petition for hearing on the ground that he does not have Locus Standi, which means he is not eligible to submit the petition. He appealed to the Appellate Division but his appeal was refused on the same ground. He accepted the court decision and stepped down immediately.In the past Professor Yunus categorically rejected the claim that he influenced the World Bank through a telephone call to his friend Hillary Clinton in withdrawing the WB funds for Padma Bridge. This time Prime Minister has presented another version of the story claiming Professor Yunus along with an Editor of a newspaper met the World Bank President to lobby for withdrawal of funds for Padma Bridge. No matter which way the story is told, Professor Yunus continues to reject it. He had repeated many times, and repeats it again in this rejoinder that Padma Bridge is a dream of the people of Bangladesh and that he would dedicate all his energy to realize this dream.Honorable Prime Minister:  Professor Yunus is a usurer.Yunus Centre: The review committee of the Government that did an in-depth review of Grameen Bank in 2011 came to the conclusion that GB has the lowest rate of interest of any microlending organization in the country. It was a report commissioned by the government which concluded that.Furthermore, the Grameen Bank is owned by the 9 million women who borrow from it. If GB makes profit, it goes to them. Not a single penny from the bank's profits has ever gone to Professor Yunus or any other individual who is not one of the women borrower-owners of the bank. Professor Yunus was always a salaried employee of the bank, never a owner to share its profit. How that makes him a 'usurer,' is a difficult logic to fathom.Honorable Prime Minister: 70% of the country was under water in 1998 and GB staff tortured people for installments.Yunus Centre: The standing policy of Grameen Bank is to suspend collection of weekly installments in a situation of disaster, and turn the bank into a humanitarian organization to save life, feed people, house them, and take care of the sick. Priority for the bank is to save lives. Grameen Bank staff is known for their commitment to help the poor borrowers to overcome their problems. That's what earned the bank worldwide admiration and respect.It is not true that GB staff would torture members for installments given the prevailing culture of the institution in disaster situation.Honorable Prime Minister:  Yunus was behind “the harassment, repression and torture” of my son, daughter, sister and my cabinet members by US intelligence agencies in the name of probing corruption allegations against them.Yunus Centre: This is an unfounded and baseless story. Professor Yunus rejects such a fictitious story.Honorable Prime Minister: Yunus evaded tax of some 40 to 50 Grameen companies.The Finance Minister followed up the Prime Minister's statement with similar false allegation stating that most Grameen companies do not pay taxes, and that they claim tax exemption like Grameen Bank. Yunus has established 40/50 companies with the Grameen name, which don't pay taxes. Only GB was exempt from giving tax, not these companies.Yunus Centre: This is a completely baseless accusation. All companies created by Professor Yunus strictly comply with the laws of land and always pay due tax. In fact, even after comprehensive attempts to find faults, no evidence of tax evasion has ever been found by the authority.All of the organizations created by Professor Yunus regularly pay tax and VAT. None of the companies receive any tax exemption or any tax privilege. They are all audited yearly and they all submit their tax returns regularly.  Just like any other business organization, these organizations also come under the oversight of respective regulatory agencies.","['prime', 'centre', 'tax', 'responds', 'grameenphone', 'minister', 'telecom', 'yunus', 'comments', 'bank', 'professor', 'grameen', 'income', 'pms', 'js']","On Wednesday, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina responded to some questions raised by the members of parliament during the PM's question hour.

Photo: Mail OnlineFour years ago, Justyn Larcombe's life was little short of perfect. He and his wife, Emma, owned a £450,000 townhouse in the genteel Derbyshire village of Ashbourne, where they lived with their baby son, Matthew.After a distinguished career in the Army, Justyn had moved into finance, earning a six-figure salary at a boutique insurance broking firm in the City of London.He drove a £30,000 Porsche while Emma had a black Mercedes. They holidayed in luxury villas in Italy and Spain, and frequently dined out with friends.Since then, things have unravelled spectacularly. Today, Justyn, 44, lives alone in a rented cottage in Shipbourne, Kent.Emma, 39, remains 200 miles away in Ashbourne having moved in with her parents last year, taking Matthew, now five, and his younger brother Oscar, three, with her.The Porsche is long gone, sold -- along with most of Justyn's possessions -- to service debts of almost £100,000.The reason? A crippling addiction to online gambling which cost Justyn both his job and his family, and saw him squander £750,000.In Justyn's case, the descent into addiction began with something as simple as a casual £5 bet on a rugby match, made one Saturday afternoon in September 2009.“I can't even remember who was playing,” he recalls. “I'd spotted an advert for Betfair and thought I'd look at its website. Perhaps I was bored and wanted a thrill.” Justyn Larcombe. Photo: Mail OnlineBetfair is a gambling website which allows users to place bets on sports events and play simulated versions of traditional casino games such as roulette and blackjack.Justyn put £5 on the winning team, at evens, and doubled his money.It wasn't long before things were spiralling out of control. Within a year, Justyn was betting thousands every weekend, driven by the urge to recreate the thrill of his early wins.He lost £17,000 on a single tennis match, after backing the Belarusian tennis player Victoria Azarenka, then World No 1, against an unknown.He found excuses to spend more and more time online. He starting working from home, telling his company the six-hour round trip to his office in London was too time-consuming.When he should have been on the phone to clients, he was betting on sport or playing roulette.“I'd go into my study at 8:00am and tell Emma I was working and didn't want any interruptions until 4:00pm,” he says.She had no reason to suspect anything. When the couple's second son, Oscar, was born in May 2010, she gave up her job managing her family's hotel to look after the boys, cashing in her stake in the hotel for £70,000, which she gave to Justyn for safekeeping.That summer, Justyn and Emma sold their home, intending to find somewhere bigger. They rented a cottage while they house-hunted.Unbeknown to Emma, Justyn began to work his way through the £100,000 they had set aside for a deposit.There was no disguising the family's tightening budget — foreign holidays became a thing of a past, and the Porsche was sold for £18,000.But Justyn told his wife this was simply because their savings were tied up in investments, and said the missing silver was “being repaired”.Inevitably, his addiction took its toll on more than just his bank balance. He found himself becoming increasingly neglectful of his sons.Matthew suffers from hemiplegia, a condition limiting his movement on the right-hand side, as well as autism and epilepsy. He needs to be closely monitored — yet, in the grip of his obsession, Justyn left him alone in the car for more than two hours.Then, last summer, Justyn, who had begun using his company credit card to fund his gambling, was confronted by the chief executive and resigned.Not long after, Emma stumbled upon the truth after seeing one of Justyn's bank statements in his office.“I was in the garden with the boys -- she just came out and said: “I know everything.” 'They spent the day phoning up debt counsellors, totting up Justyn's losses, and working out how to cope with their budgetary black hole with the help of one of Emma's friends, who works in financial services.It was too little too late. Emma left soon afterwards, taking the boys and moving in with her parents. She has since filed for divorce.Unemployed, virtually penniless, and parted from his beloved family, Justyn's life was in tatters. Yet still he gambled, even selling Emma's abandoned £6,500 diamond engagement ring for just £2,000.When it came, intervention assumed an unlikely form. Two months after Emma had left, Justyn's 70-year-old mother, Jennifer, arrived at his front door.Warned by Emma that Justyn was facing eviction, she had driven from her home in Maidstone, Kent, to give him an ultimatum.She said: “You can either come home, or you can stay here alone and end up homeless.”So, 26 years after leaving home to join the Army, Justyn moved back in with his mum. He had nothing but a black bin liner of clothes and debts of £70,000 to his name.Since then, he has been attending Gamblers Anonymous meetings, and is beginning to recover. He has installed software on his computer to block access to gambling websites, and says he isn't tempted to gamble.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['match', 'working', 'justyns', 'emma', 'gambling', 'bet', 'justyn', 'sold', 'online', 'began', 'porsche', 'tennis', 'moved']","Unlucky: A bet on tennis player Victoria Azarenka at Wimbledon cost Justyn Larcombe, £17,000 when she fell and injured herself during the match.

A recent dance performance at Chhayanaut.(Photo: Mumit M.)As I entered the new red brick Chhayanaut Sangskriti Bhaban in Dhanmondi, I was struck by its magnificence. The structure had remained true to the school's founding philosophy of “open door for all”--- the building purposefully has no perimeter walls. There was a constant mass of students, teachers, poets, artists, young and old streaming through the doors from dawn to dusk.The classes for children with special needs and Nalonda, now in its 10th year, were closed in the evening, but the rest of the building was throbbing with activity. The halls were reverberating with choruses of classical, Nazrul, Tagore and folk. In between the words I could hear the strumming of the sitars and melodic violin accompanied by the deep and rapid beat of the tabla and pakhwaj. Other students were milling about, sipping tea in the cafeteria, passionately debating something or the other or just browsing through the library upstairs.A wave of nostalgia swept over me as I remembered my student days. Chhayanaut had turned 50, and I was here to meet the person who had been one of the principal driving forces behind it -- Dr. Sanjida Khatun.She was waiting for me at her first floor office. As President of Chhayanaut, she was busy directing the last details of the programme the school had chalked out to mark the occasion to be held on November 25 and 26.“Chhayanaut has always maintained a low profile, as we believe in work and not grandiose ideas for celebrations,” she said. “You must remember that from your student days here.”After a few moments, a nostalgic Sanjida apa (as she is fondly known), started talking about Chhayanaut.She recalled how Chhayanaut started. It was winter and the erstwhile Pakistan government had intensified its attempts to stamp out Bengali identity and culture from East Pakistan. A group of energetic activists, angered by the military regime's latest tactics, decided to unite and defy the junta. To register their protest, they celebrated Rabindranath Tagore's birth centenary in May 1961, a radical step in those times, since there was a strict ban on Tagore, she went on.After the successful celebration, the group reunited at a picnic in Joydebpur and contemplated continuing the movement. Members of this group included iconic figures such as Sufia Kamal, Mokhlesur Rahman Sidhu, Shamsunnahar Rahman, Ahmedur Rahman, Mizanur Rahman, Saifuddin Ahmed, Saidul Hasan, Farida Hasan, Waheedul Haq and, of course, Sanjida Khatun.It is no surprise that such like-minded cultural activists found the regime stifling and they chose to fight it on the frontier they knew best: the cultural front. With poet Sufia Kamal at the helm, the group set in motion a silent but powerful cultural revolution. Chhayanaut was thus born.Chhayanaut signifies the shade of a tree. It was aptly named by the couple Saidul Hasan and Farida Hasan to represent an organisation under whose shade Bengali culture could be nourished and nurtured. The task of building the organisation fell upon Waheedul Huque, added a nostalgic Sanjida Khatun. He took on the role to promote all genres of music -- from classical, Nazrul Sangeet, Rabindra Sangeet to folk -- in their purest forms.“Chhayanaut has been blessed by a core group from its embryonic stage: Saira Mohiuddin (its first vice president), Ahmedur Rahman, Saifuddowla, Dr. Sarwar Ali, Jamil Chowdury, Mazharul Islam, Hosne Ara Islam, Hosne Ara, Dr. Noorun Nahar Fyzennessa, Quamrul Hassan, Rashid Chowdhury, Debdas Chakravarti, and Nitun Kundu, to name a few. Noted painter Qayyum Chowdhury designed the insignia for Chhayanaut.“Over the years, Chhayanaut was passionately led by a dedicated group of people such as Farida Hassan, Kamal Lohani, Ziauddin, Zahedur Rahim, Saifuddowla, Iffat Ara Dewan and currently Khairul Anam, who has been serving as its general secretary for last the 20 years. Some of the most critical pillars for Chhayanaut have been the teachers who spent their lifetime training aspiring artistes. Chhayanaut would not be what it is today if it were not for mentors such as Ustad Moti Miah, Sheikh Luthfur Rahman, Sohrab Hossain, Zahedur Rahim, Anjali Rai, Ustad Phul Mohammad, Ustad Khurshid Khan, Ustad Modon Gopal Das, Md. Shahjahan and more.“Artistes, littérateurs, painters and, most importantly, people from all sections sought beauty in melody, rhythm, art, Bangaliana and in their everyday life. This became the driving force of our organisation,” said Sanjida Khatun with pride. Under its shade, people found a common voice and a brotherhood of cultural enthusiasts developed.One matter of pride, said Sanjida Khatun, is that Chhayanaut grew as an inspiration for the people and was in turn, built and funded entirely by the people. However, the struggle to build a permanent home for the school went on for decades. It was only in 2005 that the school's organisers felt they had raised sufficient funds. On a piece of land presented by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, architect Bashirul Huque designed the building's blueprints and the school took shape.Despite the peaceful nature of the school, it has been prone to deadly attacks. The most dreadful one was the 2001 bombing of the Pahela Baishakh programme that killed ten and injured hundreds. The Pahela Baishakh festivities had become an iconic Chhayanaut programme. People from far and wide congregated at the crack of dawn under the historic banyan tree (Botomul) at Ramna Park to listen to the top talents of the school usher in the New Year through music. It was one of the most symbolic gatherings of people who shared a common Bengali identity and an ideal target for terrorists who wanted to destroy it.“The bomb blast threw us into a dilemma. The loss of life was extremely tragic. It also raised the question of whether we had been able to unite all sections of society in a common bond,” said Sanjida Khatun. However, the bond that people shared was truly strong. The following year, defying all expectations and fears of another attack, people in even greater numbers thronged the venue, united in defiance.“Young minds need to be informed about their culture through any means that can best reach them. To ignite their interest, we chalked out a project 'Shikor' (roots) that offered classes ranging from theatre, recitation, brotochari dance to even exploring new tastes such as 'Attkorai'. For the adults, we run a course 'Bhashar Alap' (language discourse).“After the untimely demise of noted Tagore singer Zahedur Rahim, Rabindra Sangeet Shilpi Parishad was launched, which now has 75 branches all across the country. An anonymous fixed deposit donation of Taka 50 lakh funds the countrywide projects.“Chhayanaut has grown over 50 years to be seen as the icon of traditional Bengali culture and a platform for ideas that can enlighten generations,” said Sanjida apa.Chhayanaut, besides training minds, also tries to work for the betterment of people in times of national crises. In the '60s when Chittagong was hit by typhoon Gorki, Chhayanaut workers organised a parade through the streets and collected funds for the victims. During the Liberation War, Chhayanaut members formed the Bangladesh Mukti Sangrami Shangstha and regularly visited the camps to lift the spirit of the freedom fighters.Chhayanaut, true to its name, has grown from a seed into a protective tree.

Google starts big advertising push around new Pixel phone,"Google's new ""Pixel"" smartphone is off to a fast marketing start with $3.2 million in television ads in two days since it announced the upcoming launch, and ad executives expect Google to spend hundreds of millions more to keep up with rivals Samsung Electronics and Apple Inc.",,2016-10-08T14:28:54+06:00,"Google's new ""Pixel"" smartphone is off to a fast marketing start with $3.2 million in television ads in two days since it announced the upcoming launch, and ad executives expect Google to spend hundreds of millions more to keep up with rivals Samsung Electronics and Apple Inc.Google's launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily.

Police oppose external probe,"The police have once again demanded that the home ministry scrap the two committees formed last year to investigate allegations of corruption, irregularities and other serious allegations against cops.",,2016-01-27T00:00:00+06:00,"The police have once again demanded that the home ministry scrap the two committees formed last year to investigate allegations of corruption, irregularities and other serious misconducts by cops.A deputy commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police made the demand at a conference of police high-ups with the home minister and the senior home secretary yesterday, the first day of the Police Week 2016. Most police officials attending the conference applauded the demand by clapping, meeting sources said.Defending their call, some top cops said departmental probes were sufficient to deal with any allegations against their colleagues.Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal did not make any comment in response to the police demand, but Mozammel Haque Khan, the senior home secretary, assured them that the government was “moving slow” on this, according to the sources.The ministry formed the two committees -- one headed by a ministry representative and the other by the deputy commissioner concerned or his/her representative -- to investigate allegations submitted to the ministry against police members.Representatives of the police headquarters were made member secretaries to both the committees.Under the plan, the ministry committee is to probe allegations against officers with the rank of assistant superintendent of police and above while the DC or his representatives against constables, inspectors and other junior officers.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  The home ministry informed the police headquarters about the decision in a letter on March 19 last year.In June, the police HQ wrote back to the ministry, demanding repeal of the decision. Besides, top officials met the home boss several times to reiterate the call in person, police and ministry sources said.   Yesterday's call comes at a time when families are demanding judicial inquiries into the allegations of police torture on Bangladesh Bank official Golam Rabby and Dhaka South City Corporation employee Bikash Chandra Das.These two incidents caused a huge uproar, demanding punishment to the cops involved in the alleged torture. Many such incidents go unreported as victims believe they will not get justice given the allegations are investigated by police themselves.The home ministry formed the two committees against such a backdrop.At yesterday's conference, DC (Tejgaon division) Biplob Kumar Sarkar, who was the first speaker, demanded that the committees be scrapped as such committees would make police “subservient,” sources said.According to him, the committees were formed “to shackle the force and destroy police members morally”.He argued that there are 29 types of cadres in government service, but none of them face external probes. In their cases, senior officers investigate any allegations against their juniors.Police officials were not happy even after the senior home secretary's assurance that the government was “moving slow”.One police official told The Daily Star after the meeting, “If it is not scrapped altogether, it will remain like a noose around our neck.”Contacted, Additional Home Secretary (police) Akhtar Hossain said the committees were still there. “It is not that that they will function all the time; we will use it in special cases.”Sources in the ministry said the committees were yet to investigate a single allegation against any cop as the police reacted sharply against the formation of the committees.  Executive Director of Transparency International Bangladesh Iftekharuzzaman said police, of course, would carry out their departmental enquiry. But in case of major allegations where only departmental probe is not enough, the ministry committee can come into play.Even, some investigations can be done by the Anti-Corruption Commission or other institutions to bring transparency and accountability and gain people's trust, he told this newspaper.Speaking at the meeting, Additional Inspector General of Police Mokhlesur Rahman said police took action in case of moral turpitude of some force members.""But we see attempts to taint the whole force for some stray incidents of deviation,"" he said.""If you notice, whenever we receive any allegation against anyone, we take punitive action against them,"" he was quoted as saying at the meeting.According to the police headquarters, some 76 policemen ranging from constable to sub-inspector were sacked or sent into forced retirement over various allegations of misconduct last year.In some other calls, officials demanded formation of a special police division, introduction of risk allowance for cops and increasing ration for the family of the police members killed while on duty.If the special division is formed, police will be able to make quick decisions and prepare their own budget, sources said.In response to these demands, the senior home secretary asked the police officials to place them in writing and that he would discuss those with the appropriate authorities.","['officials', 'allegations', 'ministry', 'external', 'secretary', 'oppose', 'special', 'committees', 'senior', 'investigate', 'sources', 'formed', 'probe']","The police have once again demanded that the home ministry scrap the two committees formed last year to investigate allegations of corruption, irregularities and other serious misconducts by cops.

It is our duty to ensure people's welfare. There would be no poverty if we can ensure the welfare of people. It is our commitment that there will be no poverty in the country.”The government has brought the poverty rate down to 22.4 percent from 97 percent. The country's per capita income would keep rising, she added.The AL chief said the party faced adverse situations many a time. But its grassroots leaders kept the organisation going by making sacrifices and overcoming the odds.Reaffirming her government's zero tolerance policy on terrorism, she said, “We've taken all measures against it. No one would be able to use the country's land for terrorist activities.

We have taken steps to build 100 economic zones for local and foreign investors to create a great number of jobs.”On the foreign policy, the PM said Bangladesh wants to maintain good relations with all at bilateral, regional and international levels.Earlier, the ruling party's council started with the rendering of the national anthem at 10:07am.Hasina arrived at the centre stage at 10:05am and inaugurated the two-day programme at 10:13am.

Questions aplenty,"Odhikar's fact-finding report, “Assembly of Hefajat-e Islam Bangladesh and Human Rights Violation”, is a composition of half-truths, biased and one-sided presentation of what happened on May 5 and in the early hours of May 6 in the capital, according to an analysis by The Daily Star.

But it has elaborately described the role of law enforcers and pro-ruling party men.",,2013-09-01T00:48:15+06:00,"Odhikar's fact-finding report, “Assembly of Hefajat-e Islam Bangladesh and Human Rights Violation”, is a composition of half-truths, biased and one-sided presentation of what happened on May 5 and in the early hours of May 6 in the capital, according to an analysis by The Daily Star.The June 10 report says nothing about the destructive activities by Hefajat men, the involvement of Jamaat-Shibir activists and their instigation of acts of violence. But it has elaborately described the role of law enforcers and pro-ruling party men.Hundreds of unruly Hefajat men were involved in widespread violence, including arson and even torching of bookshops that sold copies of the holy Quran. Though many TV channels broadcast the incidents live, Odhikar is completely silent about it. It has depicted Hefajat-e-Islam as a very peaceful organisation and its leaders and activists as innocent individuals.While being flushed out of Shapla Chattar, Hefajat men attacked a policeman with bricks near the Alico building in Motijheel, leaving him dead on the spot. A correspondent of The Daily Star covering the event on that night witnessed it, but the Odhikar report made no mention of it.The 28-page report starts with an introduction of Hefajat and its objectives. It termed Hefajat a people's platform, a non-political and socio-cultural organisation, and mentioned its objectives were to promote “social dialogue to dispel prejudices that affect community harmony and relations”.In reality, Hefajat's character is completely the opposite of what the Odhikar report states. The organisation's recent activities, provocative speeches of its leaders, the 13-point demand, its anti-women and anti-constitutional stance clearly go against the spirit of community harmony. It is against the secular education policy and has staged violent demonstrations against the government's avowed policy of equal rights for women.Hefajat is no longer a non-political organisation. Practically, it is now a political force -- very much aligned with the BNP, Jamaat and other Islamist and smaller political parties.In the second paragraph, Odhikar says the Hefajat's protest was “instigated by some bloggers and activists that mobilised at the Shahbagh movement”, and who were making “vulgar, humiliating, insulting and provocative remarks in the social media sites and blogs against Islam, Allah and Prophet Hazrat Mohammad (pbuh).”The report, however, doesn't mention how it came to such a conclusion or how it had found that the organisers of the Shahbagh movement, who are also “bloggers and activists”, were actually involved in such activities.The human rights organisation doesn't say whether the allegations made by Hefajat were true, or whether it conducted any investigation into the matter before coming to such a partisan and politically-motivated conclusion. Odhikar simply believed in what Hefajat leaders had claimed to be true.It went on sympathising with the Hefajat's stance by saying, “In some cases the Prophet was portrayed as a pornographic character, which infuriated people of all walks of life.” Odhikar then mentions a High Court directive, and the obligation under Article 39 of the constitution that demands that the government prevent such blogs and defamatory comments. But the government took no action in this regards.But it is not true. Since the issue was brought before the public earlier this year, the government blocked nearly a dozen blogs. But many others had popped up. The Daily Star found that several websites had articles in the names of bloggers, who support the Shahbagh movement. Actually, those bloggers didn't post the articles on the websites.Four bloggers were arrested allegedly for hurting religious sentiments but Odhikar remained silent about it.Islamist fanatics, who have been demanding execution of “atheist bloggers”, killed a blogger and injured another. These incidents were part of the whole development that Odhikar didn't mention.It says the combined forces launched a brutal attack on the Hefajat rally despite being aware of the presence of adolescents and children from madrasas. It claimed some of them had been missing after the crackdown, while some others reportedly lost their lives.Odhikar tried to justify bringing in the children to the Hefajat rally by saying, “Presence of children at political rallies is also found in government and opposition party programmes.”But the human rights body kept mum about how Hefajat violated the rights of the minors and risked their lives by bringing them to the rally and using them for their petty interests.The Odhikar report is also silent about the fact that the minors were forced to come, lied to, and lured with money. This is a clear violation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Children and Children Act 2013, which mentions that children should not be engaged in any risky work or job that can jeopardise their health.In order to prove the innocence of the fanatic organisation, the report quotes Hefajat leader Azizul Haq Islamabadi, “Hefajat strictly asked its members not to bring children or minors to the rally, but some minors were too enthusiastic and joined the movement.”The report contains interviews of 24 people, but not of a single minor. Odhikar couldn't interview any minors to know about the facts. The report was zealous in mentioning that most of the minors were students of Qawmi madrasa and orphans, and they came from non-affluent families, and were not provided with any help by the government.The report gives a wrong message that the Hefajat men's only intention was to offer “doa and zikir”, and they hurled brickbats at law enforcers and set fire to objects around the stage to save themselves from police action. But it has made no mention of the instigation and anti-government speeches by Hefajat leaders.Odhikar said the telecast of Islamic and Diganta televisions was stopped at 2:30am and 4:27am to make sure that the May 6 incident didn't go on air. But it didn't say that the broadcast of the two channels was stopped for airing misleading death figures.The two TV channels claimed that hundreds of Hefajat men were being killed in police attacks and the bodies were kept at Al-Baraka and Islami Bank hospitals. But the claims later turned out to be false.The Daily Star on that night called both the hospitals that declined to say anything about the bodies. The following day, a reporter from The Daily Star visited both the hospitals to get names of the deceased. But they again failed to show any proof.Police flushed out the Hefajat men around 2:40am and Diganta TV continued broadcasting the happenings till 4:27am.DEATH FIGURESOdhikar claims 61 people died in the police crackdown on the Hefajat rally at Shapla Chattar, which is misleading and confusing. Odhikar collected a list of 16 deceased from the DMCH morgue and put it in its report. But The Daily Star found that at least three of them had died in clashes between Hefajat men and police in Narayanganj.Odhikar didn't give a full list of the victims on the plea of security of their family members. However, it gave identities of two other persons along with the interviews of their relatives. It also gave identities of 69 injured people but didn't mention that any of them were attacked or received threats after the disclosure of their identities.Odhikar's death claim didn't tally with the death toll published in different national dailies and the count in The Daily Star's investigation.The report mentions the death of 66-71 people, referring to Hefajat activists, victims' relatives, some unnamed witnesses, a photojournalist, and hospital sources. Three of them died in firing by police and ruling party men on May 5 afternoon while the rest at night.It also quotes an anonymous Hefajat member, who claimed to be informed of 202 deaths, and another anonymous witness, who said seven people had lost their lives. It also quoted Jewel, an injured, who claimed to have seen 27-32 bodies during the crackdown.The report quotes a madrasa student, Majedul Islam, who saw seven to eight bodies at the Sonali Bank premises. Five people among those, who were severely injured, died at different hospitals, claims the report.Odhikar interviewed an unnamed photojournalist who alone saw 16 bodies in and around Shapla Chattar on that night. He first saw four bodies wrapped in white cloth near the Hefajat stage, two near Modhumita Cinema Hall, seven at Sonali Bank premises and one each at a petrol pump and in a pick-up van. He also saw two persons carrying a body.The four bodies found near the stage were actually of the victims of daytime violence. Hefajat men demonstrated in the afternoon carrying the bodies. But the Odhikar report tries to prove they were killed during the crackdown at night.The Daily Star has been able to find the photojournalist whose name is Naim Parvej Apu of Banglar Chokh.“I told Odhikar everything I saw that night but many things were not included in the report,” Apu said.“I spoke of seeing only four bodies at the Hefajat stage. I didn't say anyone else was dead. I said they were either bullet-hit or injured.”On the use of Banglar Chokh's photos in the Odhikar report, he said all types of photos, including those of the destructive activities of the Hefajat, were available on the website.“We used the word 'dead' only in the photo caption of the four bodies near the stage. We did not use that word in the captions of other photos,” Apu told The Daily Star.Quoting the international media and Al Jazeera, the Odhikar report says 50 people were killed but it makes no mention of any local media that covered the event entirely.Creating confusion over the deaths, it says, “Considering the circumstances it was very difficult to know how many people were killed and where the bodies were taken. Odhikar prepared this fact finding report on a primary basis by carrying out its own fact finding missions. The number of deaths mentioned here only confirms and highlights the identities of people killed that night.”Interestingly, when asked by The Daily Star, Odhikar changed its position and claimed the dead included those killed in the daytime on May 5, but it failed to say how many died during that time.The report doesn't say how many died in the attacks by pro-AL men and whether those were included in the list of 61 dead.It portrays many Hefajat men lying on the ground as dead. Actually, they were pretending to be dead. They later got up and left the area.ODHIKAR'S RESPONSEThe Daily Star talked to Odhikar's Senior Research and Programme Coordinator Taskin Tahmina and Director ASM Nasir Uddin Elan on the points mentioned above.Asked why the report was silent about Hefajat's destructive activities and why it had portrayed the fanatic organisation as a peaceful, modest and innocent one, Taskin said the fact finding was done to enquire into the allegations of extra-judicial killings.“In doing so, we needed to tell the story from the beginning. Our point of consideration was that extra-judicial killings took place, irrespective of whether Hefajat was innocent or not.”She said the majority of the media was against Hefajat and reported it had carried out the destruction, but when Odhikar talked to Hefajat leaders they completely denied it.“As we were not there, we decided in principle not to say anything on this point.”Taskin claimed that Odhikar's report was not one-sided; rather the reports of the majority of the media on the Hefajat rally and the Shahbagh movement were biased.On the issue of not disclosing the full list of the dead, Nasir Uddin Elan said the families of the victims were under tremendous pressure not to say anything about the incident.“They were forced to complete the formalities and bury the bodies in a hurry. AL men are keeping an eye on the families of the victims. We cannot put them in danger.”About finalising the list of 61 deceased, Taskin said they made the list after talking to the family members of the victims and hospital authorities.Taskin, however, said she didn't support Hefajat's bringing children to its programme through lies and promises of payments.Asked why it was not mentioned in the report, she claimed that Odhikar could not contact any of them.On the methodology of its investigation, she said a five-member fact-finding mission worked on it while Odhikar staff across the country helped the mission to take interviews of the persons concerned, including the family members of the victims.About using two death figures -- 46 and 107 -- in incidents of political violence in May, Taskin and Elan claimed the first figure didn't include the victims of extra-judicial killings that took place involving the Hefajat rally as their investigation was underway. They claimed the death figure was updated in June and it stood at 107.Asked why the 61 deaths were mentioned as political killings in the May report, Taskin said those should have been put in the section for extra-judicial killings.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['hefajat', 'claimed', 'daily', 'odhikar', 'men', 'say', 'didnt', 'questions', 'star', 'bodies', 'report', 'aplenty']","In reality, Hefajat's character is completely the opposite of what the Odhikar report states.
The Daily Star found that several websites had articles in the names of bloggers, who support the Shahbagh movement.
The Odhikar report is also silent about the fact that the minors were forced to come, lied to, and lured with money.
The following day, a reporter from The Daily Star visited both the hospitals to get names of the deceased.
The Daily Star has been able to find the photojournalist whose name is Naim Parvej Apu of Banglar Chokh."
Rohingya Detainees in KSA: Riyadh moves to deport them to Bangladesh,"Saudi Arabia is going to deport scores of Rohingyas, held indefinitely by the kingdom, to Bangladesh, reports Middle East Eye (MEE), a London-based news portal covering events in the Middle East.",,2019-01-08T00:00:00+06:00,"Saudi Arabia is going to deport scores of Rohingyas, held indefinitely by the kingdom, to Bangladesh, reports Middle East Eye (MEE), a London-based news portal covering events in the Middle East. The Rohingyas, some of them having spent nearly five to six years in Saudi detention, were being prepared on Sunday for deportation at the Shumaisi detention centre in Jeddah, it reported on Sunday.Quoting Rohingya rights activists, journalist Areeb Ullah of the MEE tweeted yesterday that the Rohingyas were scheduled to board a Saudi Airlines flight at 5:00pm (Saudi time) yesterday and arrive in Bangladesh early today.Many Rohingyas locked up in the Shumaisi detention centre went to Saudi Arabia on Bangladeshi passports, obtained via fake documents.Contacted, Mujibur Rahman, counsellor at Bangladesh Consulate General in Jeddah, however, said they did not issue travel pass to any Rohingya.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  “We issue outpass [travel pass] to those whose Bangladeshi citizenship could be verified. So, there is no question of Saudi Arabia deporting Rohingya,” he told The Daily Star over phone yesterday evening.The MEE, however, says one of the videos sent to it shows a Rohingya detainee sitting down, filming secretly, as dozens of Rohingyas are lined up to be processed for removal in Shumaisi. Some Rohingyas were also put in handcuffs after they attempted to resist their deportation to Bangladesh, according to voice notes sent to the MEE. The man in the video, who is speaking Rohingya, said, “I've been here for the last five to six years; now they are sending me to Bangladesh. Please pray for me.""Another recording sent to the MEE recounted the events that led up to Sunday's forcible removal of the Rohingyas.“They came to our cells in the middle of the night at 12:00pm, telling us to pack our bags and get ready for Bangladesh,” said a Rohingya detainee, who wished to remain anonymous.“Now I am in handcuffs and being taken to a country I'm not from - I am a Rohingya, not Bangladeshi.""Nay San Lwin, a Rohingya activist, condemned the Saudi deportations.“If these Rohingya detainees are released in Saudi Arabia, they can support their families held in refugee camps in Bangladesh, instead of accepting their deportation to Bangladesh,” Lwin told MEE.“They are not criminals to be held in handcuffs, and I am very sad to see them being treated like criminals by the Saudi authorities.“I appeal to the Saudi government, as a Rohingya, not to deport anyone and release them as soon as possible.""Commenting on what will happen to the deported Rohingyas, Lwin said, “Now they will be sent to refugee camps and will increase the number of refugees in Bangladesh.”In October last year, Middle East Eye reported that Rohingya detainees were being prepared for deportation just days after Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina visited Saudi Arabia.Documents leaked to MEE confirmed testimony from detainees that forms from the Saudi interior ministry demanded a confirmation on the refugees' “full mental health” before their deportation to Bangladesh.Detainees said Rohingyas were ""punched"" in the chest by Saudi immigration police and forced to sign the documents.Some Rohingyas had also come on passports from other South Asian countries, including Bhutan, India, Pakistan and Nepal.The Rohingyas have been denied citizenship in Myanmar since 1982. Deprived of basic rights and persecuted in Myanmar, they escaped to Bangladesh following various waves of violence since the 1980s. Since August 2017, over 750,000 Rohingyas fled brutal military campaign in Rakhine to Bangladesh.","['saudi', 'arabia', 'ksa', 'mee', 'yesterday', 'detainees', 'rohingya', 'bangladesh', 'deportation', 'riyadh', 'moves', 'sent', 'deport', 'middle', 'rohingyas']","Many Rohingyas locked up in the Shumaisi detention centre went to Saudi Arabia on Bangladeshi passports, obtained via fake documents.
