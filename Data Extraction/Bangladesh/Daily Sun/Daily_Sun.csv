YOU ARE BEING ABUSED, BROTHER! I’m really sorry to hear what you are facing.You are dealing with a broken person. Violence is the last resort for many people with a low self-esteem andany person with an addictive personality has a low self-esteem. That can even cause depression. Walking away right now would make you a nasty person. Never kick a manor a woman when they’re down! Why don’t you try giving her an ultimatum and let her make the decisionto shut you out or work onherself and your relationship. Tell her she should seek help from an organisation like AlcoholicsAnonymous – or else go for therapy. Abuse can be experienced by both women ANDmen, and that is definitely the case with you.
