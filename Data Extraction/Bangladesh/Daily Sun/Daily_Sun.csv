BOOZE RUINS LIVES!,“THE wake-up call for me should have been the day a bullet blew my hat off.”.,Jabu Kumalo,2018-08-15T14:30:02.000Z,"“THE wake-up call for me should have been the day a bullet blew my hat off.” These were the words of Mussolini Shumi, who has managed to stop drinking thanks to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). He told Daily Sun he sometimes couldn’t believe he was still alive after all the drinking and criminal activities he was involved in. Speaking about the day he almost lost his life, Mussolini said: “We were coming back from a soccer match between Chiefs and Sundowns when we decided to rob a guy. “There were four of us and we thought he was an easy target because he was with a woman. “As we tried to grab him, he pulled out a gun and fired at us. The first bullet hit my friend and severely injured him. “We scattered all over the place and he kept on shooting. I felt my hat leaving my head as it was hit by a bullet. “Every time I think about that moment, I sweat a bit.” Mussolini said they later learned the man was a soldier. He said thanks to AA, he was happy to say he no longer lived a rough and dangerous life. To show his gratitude, Mussolini and some members of his AA group in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, will be holding a rally this Saturday. He said the aim of the imbizo was to spread the message to those still ruled by alcohol that there was hope for them. The imbizo will be held at Tsolo Hall on Makau Street from 9am. The venue is close to the well-known Change Bible Church. Mussolini, who has been sober for 10 years, said: “After being involved in two car accidents while driving a company car, I knew I needed help or I would die. “I decided to tell my employers the truth and was booked into rehab. When I came out, I joined AA and the past 10 years have been pure bliss.”Mussolini said anyone who thinks they might have a drinking problem should attend the event to find a solution.","['drinking', 'hit', 'hat', 'imbizo', 'involved', 'decided', 'mussolini', 'lives', 'thanks', 'day', 'booze', 'aa', 'ruins']","He told Daily Sun he sometimes couldn’t believe he was still alive after all the drinking and criminal activities he was involved in.

NAIR MAY GO FOR MENTAL HEALTH CHECK!,HE called President Cyril Ramaphosa the k-word in a widely circulated Facebook video.,Sun Reporter,2018-10-02T09:34:03.000Z,"HE called President Cyril Ramaphosa the k-word in a widely circulated Facebook video.And now the Verulam Family Court is expected to make a ruling on Tuesday on whether Kessie Nair can apply for bail or be sent for mental observation before applying for bail.State prosecutor Carlson Govender and Nair's attorney Chris Gounden submitted their final arguments on Monday afternoon on the state's application that Nair be sent for a 28-day mental assessment at Fort Napier Hospital in Pietermaritzburg.Nair - the former Durban councillor and convicted fraudster who called President Cyril Ramaphosa the k-word in a widely circulated Facebook video - has been charged with six counts of crimen injuria and two of incitement of public violence.Govender argued that Nair should be treated as an in-patient at Fort Napier.He said the court should consider the evidence of a district surgeon who examined Nair on the day of his first court appearance, the evidence of Nair's brother Krishnan and that of the investigating officer Warrant Officer Ajay Lutchnan.The district surgeon had found that Nair showed no signs of mental illness but recommended that he should be sent to Fort Napier for 28 days, the court heard.Krishnan told the court that he noticed ""changes"" in Nair's mental state when he visited him at Westville prison on ""numerous occasions"".Lutchnan told the court that there was a time when he couldn't understand what Nair was saying when he took his fingerprints on the day of his arrest.Lutchnan said they had interacted about Nair's time in prison and about Nair ""belonging to a 26 section of the prison"".However, Gounden hit back at the state's witnesses.""The district surgeon is incompetent to do a mental observation, has no qualifications to deal with someone's mind and lacked expertise to make such an assessment. The district surgeon recommended that the accused be sent to Fort Napier but found that he had no signs of mental illness, which is contradictory,"" argued Gounden.His said Krishnan's evidence should not be considered because ""he can't manage his own affairs"" and had also ""sought assistance"".Krishnan had admitted in court that he was a member of Alcoholics Anonymous but said he had been clean for two and a half years.Gounden also argued that Nair should have been summoned to appear in court instead of being arrested.

Search,,,None,"FIVE YEARS ON, VICTIMS' FAMILIES STILL STA...Families affected by the Marikana massacre deserve justice and closure after what happened to their loved ones.These families have lost breadwinners and five years on, many haven’t received anything concrete.It’s clear no one will ever be arrested even though police are seen shooting people on video.These families are starving and their kids no longer can study because of what happened in 2012.For these victims, justice has been delayed. They are still waiting for meaningful compensation beyond assistance with funerals and school fees.Those who were in charge during the massacre still have their jobs and there has been no accountability or punishment.Where are the houses, roads, clinics and basic services promised by the different government departments?During these five years, no one has come forward to apologise for what they have done.No one has accepted responsibility or come forward with solutions for the mess they created.It is our duty as a people to rebuild that community and keep the dead people’s memory alive.The history books must record what happened at Marikana so we can learn from it.The families deserve more.A fund should have been created long ago as these people have been very badly treated.Our leaders must take responsibility and tackle the families’ poverty. Something must be done as things cannot carry on like this.Even the unions must take full responsibility. Let people actively help them rather than just commemorate the massacre.
