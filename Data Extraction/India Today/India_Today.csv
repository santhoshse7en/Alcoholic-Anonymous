One of the most successful ways of treating addicts is Alcoholics Anonymous programme,"Today the T.T. Ranganathan Clinical Research Centre (TTRC) has grown into an institute of national repute and is the only one of its kind for treating alcoholics. - Issue Date: Apr 30, 1986",. Raj Chengappa,1986-04-30 00:00:00,"Aversion therapy: effective Aversion therapy: effective

When Shanthi Ranganathan, a Madras housewife, decided to set up an exclusive centre for the treatment and rehabilitation of alcoholics five years ago, many people dismissed her efforts as the desperate actions of a grief-stricken wife. Her husband, an industrialist, had just died from alcoholism and Shanthi recalls: ""People thought I was crazy. They could not accept that alcoholism could be cured, and doctors warned me that it was a disease of only relapses and remissions."" But Shanthi was determined. She did a course in the US on the treatment of alcoholics and started a centre in her sprawling home on the quiet Santhome High Road in Madras.Today the T.T. Ranganathan Clinical Research Centre (TTRC) has grown into an institute of national repute and is the only one of its kind for treating alcoholics. Given the excellent cure rate of almost 60 per cent, the annual inflow of patients has gone up from 62 in 1981 to 320 last year.Before the centre was established, there were hardly any treatment facilities for the country's three million alcoholics, most of whom were admitted to the general wards of hospitals and treated for symptoms like jaundice or hallucinations. The centre's success lies in the fact that it offers treatment for the basic problem of alcoholism. It first admits patients to a nursing home for withdrawal symptoms like hallucinations, vomiting and severe shakes.Once the ""detoxification programme"" is over, patients undergo intensive individual and group therapy sessions. Surprisingly, most patients blame their problems on others. A bank manager undergoing treatment blamed his son who dropped out of college as the reason for his heavy drinking.The group therapy sessions help patients to confront their problems head on. In these sessions, recovering alcoholics narrate their problems, providing hope and making it easy for new patients to identify with them. Says psychologist Christina Chakravarthy: ""Group therapy helps in assuaging their guilt and releases their bottled-up feelings."" The patient is able to admit both to himself and others that he is an alcoholic.But to ensure that he does not yield to fresh temptation, the patient is put on a drug called Antabuse which causes a violent reaction if he consumes alcohol while on the course. The reactions could even result in death unless an antidote is administered within 24 hours.However, getting an alcoholic to admit that he is one and keeping him off liquor for a month is, as psychiatrist J.V. Devar puts it, ""only half the battle won"". The more difficult part is rehabilitating him so that he can start living a normal life. Most alcoholics have snapped ties with their family and friends and have probably lost their jobs too. One of the major hurdles psychiatrists face is in getting the family to be more understanding towards recovering alcoholics. This is easier said than done as the wife of a salesman-turned-alcoholic narrates. Her husband found that he hardly had any role to play at home because she did all the work and the children held back from him. To overcome these problems, the centre holds regular family counselling sessions where the families are taught how to cope with recovering alcoholics.While centres like TTRC may be difficult to replicate in the country, elsewhere, hospitals which have set up de-addiction clinics (and there are very few) have also been reporting encouraging results. One of them is the de-addiction centre run by the KEM Hospital in Bombay. Using a judicious combination of group therapy, individual counselling and an Antabuse course, the clinic reports that in the past two years it has been able to achieve a cure rate of 46 per cent. And in Bangalore, NIMHANS psychologists using aversion have reported an encouraging 45 per cent cure rate. Says psychologist V. Kumaraiah: ""We found that married people responded to treatment better than the rest, and the recovery rate was the highest among the older groups.But probably one of the most successful ways of treating addicts is the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) programme which is fast gaining popularity in the country. AA is a non-profit world-wide organisation of recovered alcoholics trying to help others in the same plight. There are already 100 such groups in the country, with Bombay alone boasting 55. Other cities with AA groups are Bangalore, Goa, Madras, Secunderabad, New Delhi, Cochin, Mangalore, Nagpur, Pune and Mysore.

AA members find that the group sessions help alcoholics to come to terms with their problems. In fact the first step for all AA members is to admit that ""we were powerless over alcohol, that our lives had become unmanageable"". The sessions also help other recovering alcoholics by constantly reminding them of their earlier plight. Said an a a member: ""By trying to help others we are actually motivating ourselves to keep away from liquor.""

For the families of alcoholics, the AA has a separate group called Al-Anon where members hold similar group therapy sessions. Rather than impose a set period of abstinence, the AA's golden rule for its members is: Get up every morning and tell yourself that you will remain sober for the next 24 hours. It seems to work.

"Compounded by denial and loneliness, alcoholism among women becomes growing urban problem","Compounded by denial and a dearth of treatment centres, alcoholism anions women is a growing urban problem. - Issue Date: Apr 15, 1995",Archana Jahagirdar,1995-04-15 00:00:00,"More than anything else, this letter from her 11-year-old daughter put Priya Singh, a Delhi housewife, back on the road to sobriety. ""That was my rock-bottom. I decided that I had to do something about my alcoholism."" But after drinking heavily for almost two years - something that pushed her marriage to the brink - she knew getting back to normal wasn't going to be easy.

She visited a rehabilitation centre, and after several relapses finally succeeded in giving up alcohol altogether. Frequent attendance at the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings helped and Priya is beginning to pick up the broken pieces of her life. She is now reunited with her two children and is trying to make her marriage work.

In urban India, alcoholism has for long been regarded as a male affliction. Not any more, as psychiatrists in the country's metropolises report. What began as a trickle of female patients coming in for treatment is now a widening stream. An estimated three out of 10 alcoholics in many established clinics across the country are now women.

Unfortunately, only now is the problem being taken seriously. At the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) in Bangalore, the country's premier neurosciences research institute, around 10 female patients used to report for treatment every month just five years ago. Now, there are 30 to 35 every month and the institute has been forced to open a separate outpatient department for women alcoholics.

Explains Dr LA. Shariff, head of the Department of Psychiatric Social Welfare at NIMHANS: ""Nobody speaks or makes public this problem because, in the Indian situation, for a woman to be alcoholic is considered worse than being a prostitute or a criminal. There is social ostracism. So, the way most women cope with it is by hiding their problem.""

In Bombay, as the problem escalated, the Kripa Foundation, which has seven centres across the country for treating alcoholics and drug addicts, had to open a separate section for women. Part of the reason, according to Ossie Pereira, co-founder of the foundation, was that ""most alcoholics, men and women, haven't been able to handle sex normally. So if I had a mixed centre, I would have to start a maternity ward instead.""

And Dr D. Mohan, head of the Department of Psychiatry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), predicts that by the year 2000, overall India is likely to see one female alcoholic for every three male alcoholics - a ratio prevalent in the West today.

So, why exactly are women in India hitting the bottle in such alarming numbers? There is no clear answer. Research worldwide points a finger at a gene which could make alcoholism hereditary. Others talk of a certain percentage of people who are exposed to alcohol automatically becoming chemically dependent on it. For instance, the who estimates that one out of 25 people who drink will turn alcoholic as a result.

Part of the reason for the dramatic rise in women's dependency on alcohol is simple - they are now more exposed to alcohol socially than at any time in the recent past. It is no longer taboo for women to drink in public, and in parties it is the done thing. Confirms Rakesh Ghildiyal, Associate Professor of psychiatry at KEM, Bombay: ""Alcohol is a bigger problem among women than any other drug because it now has social sanction.""

Nowadays, three out of 10 alcoholics reporting for treatment in established clinics in Indian cities are women.

Others, like Delhi-based psychiatrist Dr Avdesh Sharma, feel that it could be modern-day problems which are driving women to alcoholism.

The most cited reason is stress. The balancing act required to keep a home and a career going has been known to take its toll. Conversely, a workaholic husband could lead to a depressed and lonely wife at home.

Rachna Sharma, 38, would agree. Three grown-up children meant more time in her hands and a loving but hopelessly busy husband had no time to fill that. The bottle provided the initial solace and then the addiction took over.

If loneliness is creeping stealthily into Indian lives as joint families - and even nuclear ones - break up, it is compounded by an increasing identity crisis faced by urbanised Indians. Are we as cool and hip as our western counterparts? Hot-shot marketing executive Sonia Malik, 40, wanted to be all that and more.

""I started drinking to deal with stress and to be in with the crowd."" The only problem was that her drinking continued well after everyone went home. And often, just as others were beginning their day - a pattern common among alcoholics.

Denial and lack of empirical data have led to the problem turning even more serious. Says Ashwini Ailawadi, an addiction counsellor in Delhi: ""We have this neat policy of denial. Indian women do not have sex, they don't have orgasms and they don't drink. We simply solve the problem by denial."" The issues a woman alcoholic faces are very different from what a man goes through - this needs to be addressed.

Her drinking is even more hidden than his, thus making it all the more difficult to detect. Says Sonia: ""I used to stay late in the office and drink secretly, but I was always very controlled in public - a woman has to be. I would fall apart the minute I reached home.""

Home, unfortunately, is not where the support system is anymore. Husbands could be alcoholics or, at the very least, the initiating party. At the other end of the scale could be an alcoholic parent hovering in the background. Rahul Khanna, 40, became the target of his wife's criticism about five years ago. Her complaint? That he drank too much.

In what she thought was an attempt at getting closer to him, Deepti, 35, too started drinking. ""We began to share a few drinks together and things began to look more cheerful."" she recalls. The cheer proved as short-lived as the fizz in a glass of beer. A truncated career and several violent fights later, the Khannas realised the severity of the problem.

Career and family life are not the only things at risk. Studies conducted in the US show that spontaneous abortions and early miscarriages are more likely to occur among alcoholic women.

Pregnant women in their first trimester are at a risk factor of 12 per cent even if they are modest drinkers. And the risk of congenital abnormalities is estimated to be as high as 32 per cent for women who are heavy drinkers. Worse, children are found to be more seriously affected by alcoholic mothers than fathers.

The problem also persists because there are no stereotypes, no target groups. And unfortunately, no safe groups either. At one end of the spectrum are groups like tribals and plantation workers, from whom come 48 per cent of women alcohol users.

Women in the weaker economic strata have always consumed alcohol. Now, there is the new addition of the middle classes, which could include anyone from a college student to a bored housewife. Says Karl Sequeria, joint director of the Bangalore-based Freedom Foundation, a rehabilitation centre: ""I find that more and more young college-going women are drinking heavily, a cause for grave concern.""

Why Treatment is Tough





Alcohol is often abused, with prescription pills making it a deadly cocktail.

Complete lack of rehabilitation centres and support groups.

Families are rarely supportive.

So, while recognition is often myopic, treatment runs into a blind alley.

Women face specific guilt trips and problems but rehabilitation centres and support groups are dominated by, and are often for, men.

Rape, manipulation and sexual baiting are all part of a woman alcoholic's routine.

With such a negative gender background, a woman with this problem finds it difficult to enter a predominantly male group. Even an immensely successful support group like AA faces this problem. There is now a crying need for separate rehabilitation centres for women, like the one NIMHANS has begun.

The silver lining to this dark cloud is that sobriety gives recovering women alcoholics an unparalleled high. Every experience is savoured with a new enthusiasm and talk of a new life.

Sonia, who was considered dead for all practical and financial reasons, is today at the centre of all family decisions. Priya is the emotional anchor for her two teenage children. Most of them further the cause of sobriety by keeping their doors open to fellow alcoholics.

"Alcoholism in India acquires alarming overtones, makes dangerous inroads in society","Unobtrusively, alcoholism in India has suddenly acquired alarming overtones. Recent surveys have produced statistical findings that illustrate the dangerous inroads alcoholism has already made in Indian society and with what devastating effect. - Issue Date: Apr 30, 1986",. Raj Chengappa,1986-04-30 00:00:00,"Pour yourself your favourite drink. Sit down, loosen your shoe laces and relax. Take a large swig. Feel the warmth flow into your system. Let the surge of confidence envelope you. Then answer these questions:

Do you prefer to drink alone?

Do you drink daily? Does drinking spoil your sleep?

Do you drink to bolster your confidence?

Is drinking affecting your work?

Is your family affected by it?

Have you ever had a black-out?



If you have answered yes to any three of these questions then it's bad news. You are either an alcoholic or well on your way to becoming one. Worried? Then push your glass firmly away and listen. You are not the only one.



A tidal wave of alcoholism is engulfing the country. While in the sixties one in 300 drinkers were alcoholics now become addicts.



At exactly 7 p.m. every Saturday in the annexe building of a church on the busy Parliament Street in New Delhi, 20-odd people sit around a hexagonal table lit by candles.

Among them are salesmen, businessmen, armed forces officers, government officials, factory workers and even a doctor. As the meeting progresses each one narrates how alcohol has destroyed his life. Choking with emotion, Mathew, a copy-writer in an advertising agency, says: ""After a drunken bout I was like an animal. I messed my pants, vomited on the floor and crawled on the floor, unable to pick myself up.""

A tremendous feeling of empathy builds as the session ends, because each understands the others' sorrows, and many of those present weep openly. The meeting is typical of those held regularly across the country by 100 such Alcoholics Anonymous groups, a rapidly growing organisation of ex-drinkers trying to reform addicts.



A different kind of scene is being enacted in a white-tiled room at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore. Krishnappa, a 38-year-old coffee planter, has his left arm strapped to a 40-volt transformer and is given a glass of whisky. As soon as he takes a sip he is given a mild shock that makes him grimace in pain. This aversion therapy is designed to make Krishnappa's psyche reject alcohol. Krishnappa started drinking when he was 16 and today he does little other than drink. His disgusted wife brought him for treatment last month.



Police test driver for drinking: Police test driver for drinking:

In more homely surroundings inside a sprawling house in Madras, Swaminathan, a 55-year-old former bank manager, struggles with a picture puzzle given to him by psychologists at the T.T. Ranganathan Clinical Research Centre (TTRC) in Madras. The puzzle is designed to test how badly Swaminathan's brain has been damaged by alcohol. Swaminathan never drank when he was young, and was introduced to liquor after he was promoted as regional manager in the bank and forced to attend 'wet' parties. Soon he was hooked. At home he became irritable and constantly abused his wife, throwing the food she served and breaking crockery. His drinking affected his son so badly that he dropped out of college.Mathew, Krishnappa and Swaminathan are only the froth on a tidal wave of alcoholism engulfing the country. And there is a cask-full of statistics to prove the point. In the '60s only one in 300 drinkers was considered an alcoholic. Then the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported that by 1980 an estimated three million - or one in 25 - of the 80 million Indians who consume alcohol had become severely addicted.Last year the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) surveyed the problem in four regions - Bangalore, Delhi. Dibrugarh and Ranchi. lt found that 20 per cent of urban consumers had become totally dependent on it, while in villages the figure went as high as 30 to 40 per cent. Davinder Mohan, who coordinated the ICMR survey and heads the Department of Psychiatry at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi, says: ""Alcohol is already taking a heavy toll in the country. It's soon going to be evident even to a blind person.""The toll, in fact, has already become starkly evident: In major hospitals alcoholics now form 20 to 30 per cent of the patients in psychiatric wards when five years ago they constituted only 0.2 per cent. In Bombay's KEM Hospital, which treated 309 patients in the past two years, sociologist Hema Shah says: ""Initially we got people only from the slum areas. But soon bank officers, managers, factory workers and even government officers started coming for treatment. The middle class too seems to be affected in a big way.""

On the production line: 350 brands to choose from On the production line: 350 brands to choose from

Last year's ICMR study indicated that half the industrial workers surveyed drink regularly, and companies report that alcoholism has become one of the major causes of absenteeism and falling productivity. At Ashok Leyland in Madras, for instance, managers estimate that atleast 500 of the company's 7,500 workers are problem drinkers. Says Executive Director J. Joseph: ""We used to have 10 per cent absenteeism, but now we find it going up to 22 per cent and we think alcoholism has a great deal to do with it.""Alcohol is a major cause of broken marriages. Relationships with wives were seriously disrupted in 64 per cent of the alcoholics. In Bombay, Bagashri Parikh, a marriage counsellor at the city court, says that one out of 10 divorces is because of alcoholic husbands and adds:' 'Most of the alcoholics beat their wives regularly.""The country's road research institutes estimate that 25 per cent of road accidents are alcohol-related and that a third of the drivers on the highway are under the influence of alcohol. In Delhi, when the AIIMS did a study of accident victims suffering from head injuries, it found that 20 per cent had consumed alcohol.Surveying the damage Hira Singh, director. National Institute of Social Defence (NISD), the Union Welfare Ministry's striking arm against drug abuse, says: ' 'There is no doubt that alcohol is the most widely abused drug in the country."" That's certainly true. Alcoholism has traditionally been associated with the tribal areas in the country, where people brew their own liquor.

Then the problem spread to the hilly areas and the northeast, and to industrial townships and the coalfields. Now other areas too have got ensnared, hitting people from all walks of life: professionals, businessmen, industrial workers, government servants, armed forces officers and farmers.

The statistics reveal that most of the patients (98 per cent) are predominantly male, and usually in the prime of their lives at 25 years and above. A majority are married and have children. In most cases they are the only bread-winners in the family. ""It's hitting the most productive section of our society and is creating havoc,"" says psychiatrist J.V. Devar in Madras.



Researchers are hard put to explain the dramatic rise in alcoholism in a country that has prohibition enshrined as a Directive Principle of the Constitution. But prohibition as a policy has been steadily given up by one state after another, and liquor is now as easily available as tea leaves in most parts of the country. Alcohol consumption, inevitably, has gone up quite dramatically. In 1976, liquor manufacturers used up 169.4 million litres of pure alcohol, enough to manufacture 350 million bottles of rum.



Alcoholics Anonymous meeting Alcoholics Anonymous meeting

But despite tough measures by the puritanical Janata government and the Congress(I)'s resolve to hold production at the 1981 level of 207.9 million litres, the consumption of pure alcohol climbed to 331 million litres last year - sufficient to produce 1,134 million bottles of rum!Indians now have more than 200 brands of whisky, 50 brands of rum, 30 kinds of brandy, 10 brands of gin, 15 of wine, 50 beers and a couple of hundred varieties of country liquor to choose from. ""People have become more brand conscious and are willing to pay more for better quality liquor these days,"" says Ravi Jain, general manager of McDowells, a subsidiary of United Breweries, which is among the big five in the liquor business. McDowells has registered a 10 per cent growth every year.That Indians are drinking more than ever before is evident by their revolutionary change in attitudes towards drinking. The traditional taboo against liquor is rapidly vanishing. More and more homes serve liquor to guests, 'dry' parties are considered boring, and traditional festivals like Ganesh Chaturthi, Diwali and Holi are used as excuses to go on drinking bouts.

Salesmen and businessmen prefer to do business over lunch lined with liquor. Among youngsters, to drink is to be manly. ""We are becoming more of an alcoholised society,"" says psychiatrist Rajat Ray of NIMHANS. And in Lucknow, psychiatrist B.B. Sethi says: ""A house not serving liquor is now an exception.""



Drinking in bars, once the haunt of only the hardened alcoholic, has gained increasing acceptance. In the outskirts of Patna. for instance, roadside bhattis, the poor man's bars, have become popular drinking places. One of them on the bypass road to Patna is a huge, sprawling dimly-lit shack reeking with the stench of liquor, rotten fish and frying eggs. Around 250 people, among them teenagers, sit around in groups chatting and shouting. They come from all social groups - rickshaw-pullers, factory workers, professionals and even police constables in civilian dress. Babu Lalrai, 35, a tailor, chirps up:' 'Yes, I drink daily and go to the Ganga for a holy dip daily.""



The wave of alcoholism is by no means confined to the cities. While the sale of country liquor in most states has risen slowly, this masks the fact that people have increasingly moved to cheaper, illicit liquor because even country liquor costs as much as Rs 8 for a bottle. In Bangalore, arrack king H.R. Basavaraj estimates that ""illicit liquor sales equal that of country liquor"". The repetitive liquor tragedies testify to this. In Bangalore more than 300 people died of liquor poisoning in 1981. The next year in the island of Vypeen in Kerala, 72 people were killed. On an average more than 200 people are killed in the country from liquor poisoning every year.



Youngsters drinking: vulnerable age Youngsters drinking: vulnerable age

What worries many psychiatrists is the widespread acceptance of beer and the current boom in beer sales. In Maharashtra, beer sales have jumped from 14 million bottles to 24 million bottles in the last five years. And in West Bengal, more beer is consumed than whisky, rum and brandy put together; last year's beer sales totalled 12 million bottles.

But if people regard beer as some kind of milk product, the harsh truth is that one bottle of beer has about the same alcohol content as a peg of whisky, and psychiatrists say that beer drinking not only opens the floodgates for more potent liquor but is addictive and in the long run can do as much damage as whisky or rum.



The splurge in drinking is reflected in the high per capita consumption of liquor. While the annual per capita consumption of alcohol by adults in India hovers around one litre of pure alcohol (equivalent to two-and-a-half bottles of rum), a little lower than Australia's 1.5 and a lot less than the US's 4.1, this figure is misleading. Unlike Australia and the US, women in India hardly drink.



So if only the male population's consumption is calculated, the figure jumps to around two litres of pure alcohol. And if only the drinking male population is taken into account, the figure is as high as 4.1, or 10 bottles of rum per head annually: high enough for the alarm bells to be ringing. Even this excludes the millions of litres of illicit liquor that goes down parched gullets. And in states like Punjab, the per capita consumption is 6.5 litres of pure alcohol, or 16 bottles of rum.



All drinkers are not drunkards. So when does a normal drinker turn alcoholic? The popular concept of the drunk is one who falls into gutters or staggers around on streets mouthing obscenities. But that, say psychiatrists, is only the last stages of alcoholism. A social drinker becomes a problem one when, according to Shanthi Ranganathan of TTRC: ""His drinking starts affecting on a continuous basis his health, his job efficiency and his relations with his family and friends."" The who estimates that one out of 10 drinkers turns alcoholic.



Most drinkers do not realise when they have crossed the thin red line between social drinking and alcoholism. In Madras, Udayakumar, 37, a former packing manufacturer, thought he had his drinking well under control till one day he realised that ""a quarter of a bottle of rum was a mosquito bite"". In Bangalore, a salesman remembers that while initially he could hardly hold a peg of whisky he suddenly found himself going on long drinking bouts.



Says he: ""Every cell in my body craved for alcohol and when I took a drink it was like setting off a nuclear reaction. I didn't stop drinking till I became unconscious."" And in Bombay, a factory supervisor initially started drinking during week-ends with friends. Then, as he says, ""after a while I drank once in three days, then every alternate day, then every day and then every hour"".



Researchers now agree that alcoholism is a disease, because alcoholics exhibit predictable symptoms and suffer the same physical and mental trauma: severe shakes, damage to vital organs like the heart and liver, and psychological breakdown. Society, which always dismissed alcoholics as weak-willed or immoral people, is only now reluctantly beginning to accept this home truth.

In Bangalore, Malavika, a 30-year-old management consultant married to a lawyer, confesses: ""I thought all drunkards were bums till my husband became an alcoholic. Initially I was bewildered and thought he drank because he was not happy with me. But I soon realised that although he desperately wanted to give up alcohol he couldn't. It was as though he had caught a disease.""



Once the disease catches on it moves with terrifying rapidity, reducing its victims to physical, mental and moral wrecks. Try as they will, they find it impossible to kick the habit even though they know that it is steadily destroying their lives. A Bombay naval officer remembers with tears how he tied his favourite Labrador and whipped it mercilessly in a drunken fit.

The next morning the dog seemed to forget the beating and wagged its tail, but he was so insane that he whipped it again. Mathew, the Delhi copy-writer, remembers how he threw up a Rs 5,000 job in a leading advertising agency when he quarrelled with his employer over a trivial matter.



Probably the most damaging effect of this wave of alcoholism, according to a doctor, is that ""not only the drinker but everyone in the family suffers. Alcoholism is a family disease."" As the alcoholic becomes more and more obnoxious, the wife and children get seriously affected. Malavika, the lawyer's wife, recalls the traumatic experience when guests dropped in one morning and found her husband lying on the floor dead drunk.

The naval commander's wife once tried to jump out of a fourth floor window after he slapped her in a drunken rage. Children too are badly affected. In a typical case in Bangalore, Arun, 17, whose father has been a chronic alcoholic, dropped out of school and took to drugs and alcohol. In fact studies abroad indicate that alcoholism could also be a familial disease, with children of alcoholics being more prone to becoming alcoholics themselves.



If more families have not broken up, it is because most Indian wives fear the stigma attached to divorce. Last fortnight Malathi, 38, the wife of a former supervisor in a printing press and mother of five children, came to social workers at the Maharashtra State Women's Council for help. Her husband had beaten her so badly that her cheek and shoulder were blue-black.



She said her husband had lost his job because of his drinking, and when she wanted to take up a job her husband refused to allow her and suspected her fidelity. Her eldest son had become a vagrant and a petty thief. But when the council suggested she divorce her husband. she flatly refused. Says the council's social worker Anila Merchant: ""For most sufferers marriage provides some form of security.""



A just-published study of workers at the Madras Port Trust, done by sociologist Saraswathi Sankaran, shows how damaging alcohol can be. Of the 162 workers surveyed, more than half of them drank heavily, and a third were addicts.



Sankaran compared the work performance of the drinkers and non-drinkers and was stunned to find that the heavy drinkers were absent every sixth working day. As a result, the non-drinkers took home 50 per cent more money than the drinkers, spent8 per cent more on food, 30 per cent more on clothing, 168 per cent more on health care and a whopping 300 per cent more on children's education. Says Sankaran: ""Whether it is poverty, malnutrition, marital disharmony or delinquent children, alcohol seems to have been the major cause of all their miseries.'' While alcoholism and its related problems increase alarmingly, progress on the treatment of sufferers has been tardy.



Most alcoholics find that doctors treat the problem as a moral issue. Said one alcoholic: ""My whole world had crumbled, and here was this doctor telling me I must develop the will power to stop drinking."" Only now are hospitals recognising alcoholism as a major problem and setting up specialised clinics for treatment (see box). As a consequence, there are facilities for treating hardly 3,000 of the estimated three million alcoholics in the country.



But even hospitals that have clinics are faced with problems like the lack of professionally trained staff.



The problem is compounded by the fact that most alcoholics do not get themselves treated till at a very late stage, because most people do not like to admit they have an alcoholic in their family and try to conceal the fact as long as possible. A factory supervisor in Bombay, who had been an alcoholic for five years, first tried to give up drinking himself.

When that failed his wife sent him to the local mantravadi to exorcise the spirit that seemed to have possessed him. It was only when he was admitted to the KEM Hospital with an attack of jaundice that he learnt the hospital had a de-addiction programme. Infact, most of the patients usually go to hospital when they have serious health problems such as cirrhosis of the liver or fits of delirium.



If the psychiatrists find it difficult to cope with the problem, the Government seems equally helpless. The state governments, which control alcohol supply and distribution, indirectly encourage people to drink more because revenue from excise forms a major part of the income of most states. In Karnataka liquor is the second biggest money-spinner for the state, netting Rs 50 crore last year, while in Tamil Nadu it accounts for a good 8 per cent of the revenue. Total liquor sales in the country would amount to something like Rs 3,000 crore, and liquor companies form a powerful lobby group.



Ironically, although the Constitution has made prohibition a Directive Principle, the states have made only feeble attempts to make prohibition effective policy. Most governments in fact have given up prohibition altogether. Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, which had imposed prohibition at different times, ran into trouble and were forced to relax their rules.



Tamil Nadu needed the excise revenue to run its midday meal scheme. Maharashtra, which strangely enough has placed prohibition and excise under the same department, is quite happy counting the take from liquor sales while running a prohibition programme to educate people on the evils of drinking. Bihar was forced to lift prohibition after a large number of people died in of illicit liquor in the Dhanbad coalfields. Right now Gujarat is the only state where prohibition is enforced, but liquor is still easily available and the policy is commonly seen as a farce.



Wiser from these experiences. many states have set up temperance boards in the fond hope that if they cannot prevent people from drinking they can convince them to drink moderately. But most of these boards do little more than release advertisements in newspapers showing a bottle marked with the familiar skull and crossbones.



With governments unable to curb the menace, people have taken matters into their own hands. In distant Imphal in Manipur, women were so disgusted with their men folk's excessive drinking that they formed themselves into an association against drunkards and kept vigil at nights in front of liquor shops and bars. Any drunkard they catch is publicly humiliated by making him walk with a string of bottles tied around his neck, and then handed over to the police. In the hills of Uttar Pradesh and tribal areas of Bihar similar people's movements have met with notable success in an area where drunkenness has become a major social problem.



Mean while, to formulate fresh strategies against drinking and drug abuse, the Welfare Ministry two years ago set up a working group chaired by its joint secretary. This is likely to stress education programmes on the evils of drinking. As Rajendra Kumari Bajpai, minister of state for welfare says: ""A stroke of the pen, like imposing a total ban, is not going to help. If we have to bring alcoholism under control we need to use persuasion, create awareness and show a strong determination to implement our programmes.""



But with both the Central and state governments failing to make a serious dent in the two vital factors that the who says leads to an increase in alcoholism - easy availability and increasing demand for alcohol - the battle of the bottle may be well and truly lost.","['alcoholic', 'drink', 'drinking', 'society', 'overtones', 'cent', 'alcoholics', 'india', 'alcoholism', 'inroads', 'makes', 'acquires', 'alarming', 'country', 'liquor', 'dangerous', 'alcohol', 'million']","In 1976, liquor manufacturers used up 169.4 million litres of pure alcohol, enough to manufacture 350 million bottles of rum.
While the sale of country liquor in most states has risen slowly, this masks the fact that people have increasingly moved to cheaper, illicit liquor because even country liquor costs as much as Rs 8 for a bottle.
Basavaraj estimates that ""illicit liquor sales equal that of country liquor"".
Most drinkers do not realise when they have crossed the thin red line between social drinking and alcoholism.

Alcohol withdrawal refers to symptoms that may occur when a person who has been drinking too much alcohol every day suddenly stops drinking alcohol.

Alternative Names

Detoxification - alcohol; Detox - alcohol

Causes

Alcohol withdrawal occurs most often in adults, but it may occur in teenagers or children.

The more you drink every day, the more likely you are to develop alcohol withdrawal symptoms when you stop drinking.

You may have more severe withdrawal symptoms if you have certain other medical problems.

Symptoms

Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually occur within 8 hours after the last drink, but can occur days later. Symptoms usually peak by 24 - 72 hours, but may persist for weeks.

Common symptoms include:

Anxiety or nervousness

or nervousness Depression

Fatigue

Irritability

Jumpiness or shakiness

Mood swings

Nightmares

Not thinking clearly

Other symptoms may include:

Clammy skin

Enlarged (dilated) pupils

Headache

Insomnia (sleeping difficulty)

Loss of appetite

Nausea and vomiting

Pallor

Rapid heart rate

Sweating

Tremor of the hands or other body parts

A severe form of alcohol withdrawal called delirium tremens can cause:

Agitation

Fever

Seeing or feeling things that arent there (hallucinations)

Seizures

Severe confusion

Exams and Tests

Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may reveal:

Abnormal eye movements

Abnormal heart rhythms

Dehydration (not enough fluids in the body)

Fever

Rapid breathing

Rapid heart rate

Shaky hands

Blood and urine tests, including a toxicology screen , may be done.

Treatment

The goal of treatment includes:

Reducing withdrawal symptoms

Preventing complications of alcohol use

Therapy to get you to stop drinking (abstinence)

INPATIENT TREATMENT

People with moderate-to-severe symptoms of alcohol withdrawal may need inpatient treatment at a hospital or other facility that treats alcohol withdrawal. You will be watched closely for hallucinations and other signs of delirium tremens .

Treatment may include:

Monitoring of blood pressure, body temperature, heart rate, and blood levels of different chemicals in the body

Fluids or medications through a vein (by IV)

Sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete

OUTPATIENT TREATMENT

If you have mild-to-moderate alcohol withdrawal symptoms, you can often be treated in an outpatient setting. You will need someone to commit to staying with you during this process and who can keep an eye on you. Daily visits to your health care provider are often needed until you are stable.

Treatment usually includes:

Sedative drugs to help ease withdrawal symptoms

Blood tests

Patient and family counseling to discuss the long-term issue of alcoholism

Testing and treatment for other medical problems linked to alcohol use

It is important that the patient goes to a living situation that helps support them in staying sober. Some areas have housing options that provide a supportive environment for those trying to stay sober.

Permanent and life-long abstinence from alcohol is the best treatment for those who have gone through withdrawal.

Support Groups

The following organizations are good resources for information on alcoholism:

Alcoholics Anonymous - www.alcoholics-anonymous.org

- www.alcoholics-anonymous.org Al-Anon/Alateen - www.al-anon.org

- www.al-anon.org National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism - http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health

- http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration - www.samhsa.gov

Outlook (Prognosis)

How well a person does depends on the amount of organ damage and whether the person can stop drinking completely. Alcohol withdrawal may range from a mild and uncomfortable disorder to a serious, life-threatening condition.

Symptoms such as sleep changes, rapid changes in mood, and fatigue may last for months. People who continue to drink a lot may develop health problems such as liver, heart, and neurological disease.

Most people who go through alcohol withdrawal make a full recovery. However, death is possible, especially if delirium tremens occurs.

When to Contact a Medical Professional

Alcohol withdrawal is a serious condition that may rapidly become life threatening.

Call your health care provider or go the emergency room if you think you might be in alcohol withdrawal, especially if you were using alcohol often and recently stopped. Call for an appointment with your health care provider if symptoms persist after treatment.

Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if seizures, fever, severe confusion, hallucinations, or irregular heartbeats occur.

Prevention

Reduce or avoid alcohol. If you have alcoholism, you should stop drinking completely.

'Alcohol has ruined my life',"Maben became a chronic alcoholic and began sleeping with a bottle under his pillow. He started absenting himself from work regularly. His increments and promotions were stopped. - Issue Date: Apr 30, 1986",. Raj Chengappa,1986-04-30 00:00:00,"Maben: back from the brink Maben: back from the brink

49, a machine operator in a Bangalore factory, began drinking heavily 15 years ago after he was superseded at work and his youngest son, Dinakar, died the same year. Maben recalls: ""At work I had no peace and at home I was unhappy. Booze was the only way I could forget my sorrows."" Instead it brought him more.

Maben became a chronic alcoholic and began sleeping with a bottle under his pillow. He started absenting himself from work regularly. His increments and promotions were stopped.



With liquor burning up all his money, Maben was invariably broke. His favourite clarinet, guitar and camera found their way to the local pawn shop, as did his wife Evelyn's jewellery, including her mangalsutra. The worst came when he was evicted from his rented two-bedroom house. Arun, his son, remembers that incident with a shudder and says: ""I can never forget how ashamed I was. All our furniture and clothes were lying on the footpath. I just ran to my friend's house and hid.""



Someone suggested that he send Rs 50 to St Francis Xavier's tomb in Goa, but that did not help. Nor did money sent to Tirupati Temple, or consulting a Mantravadi, who made him wear a charm around his waist and charged him Rs 1,000 for his pains. He was admitted to NIMHANS as many as 18 times for treatment, and the doctors refused to admit him any more.



Frustration and desperation drove him to drink a bottle of varnish last year, which nearly killed him. After that he vowed to give up drinking and over a period of one year, Maben's transformation has been dramatic. He has started doing yoga, which helps him sleep well. He goes to work regularly.



At home things have improved considerably, and Evelyn now goes shopping with him - something they had not done for years. Every Sunday all of them sing bhajans at a nearby spiritual centre. Daughter Chandrika says: ""There is so much peace at home now.""



Narayan, 44, a peon in a bank in Madurai is not so happy. An alcoholic for the past 10 years, Narayan was brought in a delirious state to the TTRC for treatment last month. His office had suspended him for coming drunk to work and warned him that unless he gave up drinking they would dismiss him.



While Narayan is still unable to speak coherently about his addiction, his wife Malini, who faced the brunt of his drunken bouts, has a sorry tale to narrate. She remembers that initially when Narayan drank she thought he was just trying to forget his worries. But soon he was coming home drunk every day, beating her regularly, and always in a foul mood. He threw away the food she made for him, he was nasty with the children and prevented them from studying at night. He did not give her money and pawned all her jewellery.



She was forced to take up work as domestic help to feed the children. And when her children worried her for money to see films, she told them sharply: ""Your father is taking my life out of me, now you don't start."" The office suspended Narayan several times, but Malini used to go and fall at the bank manager's feet and beg for mercy. Meanwhile Narayan became so weak that according to Malini ""he is now only eyes and stomach. I don't know how much longer he would live.""



Anand, 33, unlike Narayan who has not yet lost his job, finds his life has been completely shattered and is only now beginning to pick up the pieces. Anand has been an alcoholic for the past 13 years. Last year his wife walked out on him, taking their two children with her. Immediately after that he lost his job as a sales executive in a Delhi travel agency.



Anand, the son of an air force officer, started drinking when in his second year at college in Nagpur. Since his father was in the armed forces, drinking was considered normal. Anand found himself increasingly attending parties where liquor was served and he says: ""I used to be the first to start drinking and the last to leave. I had a tremendous capacity, and even if I had five large pegs I would never get drunk."" After graduation, his job as a sales executive offered even more opportunities to drink and, as he puts it: ""It was an ideal job for an alcoholic, became a 24-hour drinker.""



For a while he thought he could handle his liquor and he made sure that his work was not affected. When his wife, a doctor, told him to give up drinking, he said: ""I thought she was a bloody nag and I used to get the feeling that the whole world was after my blood."" Soon he became irregular at work and extremely irritable at home, hitting his wife once in anger.

That's when she left him. He was forced to give up his job because, as he says: ""I couldn't handle two careers at one time: my drinking and my job."" Last year he touched rock bottom:' 'I had become like a caged tiger. I didn't know how to escape and all I did was hide myself in the bottle."" He finally joined an Alcoholics Anonymous group in Delhi, and now he says: ""My obsession is gone. But I'm not going to take up a job till I'm fully recovered.""



David: groping for help David: groping for help

32, a packer in a Bombay firm, has had equally traumatic experiences with alcohol. Living in a dirty slum in Ghatkopar, David, who looks older than his age, is slowly recovering from the damaging effects of alcohol. His speech is still slurred and he gropes for words. His hands tremble uncontrollably. Doctors attending on him say his brain has suffered some damage and it may be a year before he is able to recover.David, who is married and has two children, remembers that he started drinking when he was around 15 years old: ""At that time we drank because after a hard day's work we had nothing to do and we wanted to forget the strain of living."" Initially he drank only on week-ends, but: ""After some time all I did was to drink, drink and sleep.''

He refused to go to work, and last year was absent for 140 days. His office sent him a charge-sheet, which he ignored. His entire pay packet of Rs 1,000 went towards liquor:' 'I used to be so desperate that I even sold my shoes and shirt."" His wife left him twice to go and live with her father.



David was admitted last month to the KEM Hospital for severe withdrawal symptoms of alcohol like hallucinations and shakes. Says David: ""Alcohol has ruined my life.""

IAF faces HC ire for confining corporal to psychiatric ward for alcohol dependency,IAF faces HC ire for confining corporal to psychiatric ward for alcohol dependency,Press Trust of India,2018-07-12 00:00:00,"New Delhi, Jul 12 (PTI) The Indian Air Force (IAF) faced the ire of the Delhi High Court today for confining one of its non-commissioned officers, a corporal, to a psychiatric ward for over two months, because he was an alcoholic and suffered from mental disorders.

A bench of justices S Muralidhar and Vinod Goel questioned the rationale behind the IAF's decision, asking how it determined on a daily basis that the corporal still ""craved for alcohol"".

The court also said the newly-enacted Mental Health Act made it clear that a person could not be forced to undergo treatment without his consent, adding that the IAF ""cannot ignore the laws of the country"".

Terming the conduct of the IAF ""irresponsible"", the bench wondered how many of such cases there might be, which were yet to be highlighted.

""How were you determining on a daily basis that his craving for alcohol had not gone down? What tests were conducted by you? This is completely irresponsible. We wonder how many such cases are there.

""This is a clear case where a man is saying he has been detained without consent. Under the new Mental Health Act, you cannot force him to undergo treatment without his consent. Then how are you pumping him full of drugs? We do not know who should be proceeded against,"" the bench said.

It added that the IAF needed to be reminded not to interfere with a person's liberty as ""short of chaining him up, everything else was done here"" and directed that the corporal be produced in court tomorrow.

According to the IAF, represented by the Centre's standing counsel, Ripudaman Singh Bhardwaj, the action against the corporal was taken on a complaint from his wife that he turned violent after consuming alcohol.

Bhardwaj said the corporal, Kriyad Yogesh Bhankhariya, had alcohol dependency issues for which he was initially treated in the psychiatric ward of the Army Base Hospital here and thereafter, in June, he was shifted to the medical centre at the Tughlakabad Air Force Station.

The court said if the non-commissioned officer (NCO) was an alcoholic, then the IAF ought to have sought the help of the ""Alcoholics Anonymous"" on how to deal with the matter as any psychiatric would confirm that confinement of a person was advisable only in extreme cases.

""It is worrying, the manner in which you have approached the situation,"" the bench told the IAF.

The court was hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by the 30-year-old corporal's father, claiming that his son was being illegally confined at the Army Base Hospital.

Alcoholic neuropathy is damage to the nerves that results from excessive drinking of alcohol.

Alternative Names

Neuropathy - alcoholic; Alcoholic polyneuropathy

Causes

The exact cause of alcoholic neuropathy is unknown. Itlikely includes both a direct poisoning of the nerve by the alcohol and the effect of poor nutrition associated with alcoholism. Up to half of long-term heavy alcohol users develop this condition.

In severe cases, nerves that regulate internal body functions (autonomic nerves) may be involved.

Risksof alcoholic neuropathy include:

Long-term, heavy alcohol use

Alcoholism that is present for 10 years or more

Symptoms

Numbness in the arms and legs

in the arms and legs Abnormal sensations , such as""pins and needles""

, such as""pins and needles"" Painful sensations in the arms and legs

Muscle weakness

Muscle cramps or muscle aches

or Heat intolerance , especially after exercise

, especially after exercise Impotence (in men)

(in men) Problems urinating , incontinence (leaking urine), feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, difficulty beginning to urinate

, (leaking urine), feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, Constipation

Diarrhea

Nausea, vomiting

Additional symptoms that may occur with this disease:

Swallowing difficulty

Speech impairment

Loss of muscle function or feeling

Muscle contractions or spasm

or spasm Muscle atrophy

Movement disorders

Changes in muscle strength or sensation usually occur on both sides of the body and are more common in the legs than in the arms. Symptoms usually develop gradually and become worse over time.

Exams and Tests

Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. An eye exam may show eye problems.

Alcoholism often makes your body unable to use or store certain vitamins and minerals. Blood tests will beordered to check for a deficiency (lack of):

Thiamine (vitamin B1)

Pyridoxine (vitamin B6)

Pantothenic acid and biotin

Vitamin B12

Folic acid

Niacin (vitamin B3)

Vitamin A

Additional tests may beordered to rule out other possible causes of neuropathy. Tests may include:

Electrolyte levels

Electromyography ( EMG )

Liver and kidney function tests

Thyroid function tests

Levels of vitamins and minerals in the body

Nerve conduction tests

Nerve biopsy

Upper GI and small bowel series

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD )

) Voiding cystourethrogram

Treatment

Once the alcohol problem has been addressed, treatment goals include:

Controlling symptoms

Maximizing ability to function independently

Preventing injury

It is important to supplement the diet with vitamins, including thiamine and folic acid.

Physical therapy and orthopedic appliances (such as splints) may be needed tomake suremuscle function and limb position are maintained.

Medicines may be neededto treat pain or uncomfortable sensations.Because persons with alcoholic neuropathy have alcohol dependence problems, theyare advised to take the least amount of medicine needed to reduce symptoms to help prevent drug dependence and other side effects of chronic use.

Positioning or the use of a bed frame that keeps the covers off the legs may reduce pain for some people.

Light-headedness or dizziness when standing up (orthostatic hypotension) may require several different treatments before finding one that successfully reduces symptoms. Treatments that may help include:

Wearing compression stockings

Eating extra salt

Sleeping with the head elevated

Using medicines

Bladderproblems may be treated with:

Manual expression of urine

Intermittent catheterization ( male or female )

Medicines

Impotence, diarrhea, constipation, or other symptoms are treated when necessary. These symptoms often respond poorly to treatment in people with alcoholic neuropathy.

It is important to protect body parts with reduced sensation from injury. This may include:

Checking the temperature of bath water to prevent burns

Changing footwear

"Simon Pegg talks about his struggle with alcoholism, depression","Simon Pegg talks about his struggle with alcoholism, depression",Press Trust of India,2018-07-10 00:00:00,"London Jul 10 (PTI) Actor Simon Pegg has opened up about his struggle with depression and alcoholism, saying that he checked into a rehabilitation centre to seek recovery.

The 48-year-old actor said while he was shooting ""Mission: Impossible III"" in 2006, he was ""fairly lost, and unhappy, and an alcoholic"".

""It was awful, terrible,"" he told The Guardian while talking about his struggle. ""It owned me.""

""When I watch that film back, I can see where I was then, which was fairly lost, and unhappy, and an alcoholic,"" Pegg added.

The actor said he ""micro managed"" his condition for quite some time, till the ball dropped.

""One thing (addiction) does is make you clever at not giving anything away. People think junkies and alcoholics are slovenly, unmotivated people. They're not they are incredibly organised. They can nip out for a quick shot of whisky and you wouldn't know they have gone. It's as if you are micro-managed by it,"" Pegg said.

""But eventually the signs are too obvious. You have taken the dog for one too many walks,"" he added.

Pegg revealed that while he was on a trip to Comic-Con to promote his 2011 movie ""Paul"", he went missing for four days.

The actor said when he returned to the UK, his home, he went into rehab which helped him turn his life around.

Drink dependence up in urban Indian women,The 33-year-old married woman from Chandigarh had never imagined that her excessive clubbing and partying would one day push her to the brink of suicide. But it did.,IANS,2012-11-30 00:00:00,"The 33-year-old married woman from Chandigarh had never imagined that her excessive clubbing and partying would one day push her to the brink of suicide. But it did.

She was not the only one. In an increasing trend of urban women taking to alcohol to cope with everyday stresses as societal norms ease, a 28-year-old woman working as a senior executive in a property broking firm in Mumbai also developed suicidal tendencies.

What started for both the Bacchus lovers as socialising, ended up in drink dependence and pushed them into the infamous club of over 14 million alcohol consumers in the country who require help. Though there are no exact figures of how many of these are women, the trend is clear.

The Mumbai woman ran up a debt of Rs25 lakh (Rs2.5 million) and attempted suicide due to her ""unmanageable"" life and depression. The Chandigarh woman showed addiction- related suicidal tendencies after a turbulent married life, extra-marital affairs and a failed patch-up bid with her husband.

The two are now trying to get a grip over their lives and move away from drink dependence, with some help from de-addiction experts who say they needed to be cared like brain patients who don't know how to prevent themselves from returning to the old habit despite being aware of its perils.

But their difficult phase is over, says NGO Tulasi Home's consultant doctor Goruv Gupta. ""Realising or accepting that one needs help is the toughest part of getting over the drink dependence problem.""

Sociologist Sachin Kumar, associated with Alcoholics Anonymous, told IANS: ""Intoxication by women in some communities has existed for time immemorial. Traditionally, it has been a collective activity but in modern times the incidence of individual drinking has shown a rise.""

The social checks or restraint that used to prescribe the limit of alcohol consumption in older times have faded over the years, leading to worst forms of drink dependence among both men and women, he said.

According to a 2009 article in journal The Lancet, Indians, officially, are still among the world's lowest consumers of alcohol - government statistics show only 21 percent of adult men and around two percent of women drink. But up to a fifth of this group - about 14 million people - are dependent drinkers requiring ""help"".

""Addiction is a chronic, relapsing disease, characterised by compulsive alcohol seeking and use, and by neurochemical and molecular changes in the brain,"" said Gupta.

For women drinkers, the news is worse than for men.

Gupta warned that alcohol addiction was more harmful for a woman's body as compared to a man; in a woman, alchohol tends to induce permanent hormonal changes in the body, making rehabilitation more difficult.

The problem of shortage of de-addiction centres was also more acute for women.

Ruchika Kumari, who works at several private de-addiction centres in Delhi, agreed: ""Alcohol addiction is considered to carry a bigger social stigma for women as compared to men and the challenge of weaning away is tougher for them due to shortage of fully-equipped centres.""

""Families need to leave the women dependent drinkers at deaddiction centre's for medical aid and counselling and this needs a lot of faith in the facility,"" she said.

""Most people prefer private facilities as they score over the government sector in terms of security, hygiene and quality of treatment.""

She revealed that there was no particular age bracket for women drinkers. ""At our centre in south Delhi, we have women from 48 years to 28 years seeking counselling.""

The service that private centres offer to get rid of dependence comes at a price.

A six-week rehabilitation procedure in some of the high-end centres in Delhi costs around Rs1 lakh (Rs100,000). In Delhi alone there are over three dozen NGO-run, private and government facilities that offer help to people with drink dependence.

Gupta warned against ill-trained quacks offering help to dependent drinkers and ending up traumatising the patient.

""I have seen a case where a patient was sent by his family to a private facility in Haryana and there he was tortured, stripped and humiliated in the name of de-addiction,"" he said.","['indian', 'drinkers', 'deaddiction', 'drink', 'woman', 'help', 'women', 'alcohol', 'private', 'urban', 'centres', 'dependence']","""Realising or accepting that one needs help is the toughest part of getting over the drink dependence problem.""

Alcohol use involves drinking beer, wine, or hard liquor.

Alternative Names

Beer consumption; Wine consumption; Hard liquor consumption; Safe drinking

Information

Alcohol is one of the most widely used drug substances in the world.

TEEN DRINKING

Alcohol use is not only an adult problem. Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month, despite the fact that the legal drinking age is 21 years old in the U.S.

About 1 in 5 teens are considered ""problem drinkers."" This means that they:

Get drunk

Have accidents related to alcohol use

Get into trouble with the law, family members, friends, school, or dates because of alcohol

THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL

Alcoholic drinks have different amounts of alcohol in them:

Beeris about 5% alcohol, although some beers can have more.

Wine is usually 12 to 15% alcohol.

Hard liquor is about 45% alcohol.

Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly.

The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly.

Certain types of alcoholic drinks get into your bloodstream faster. A carbonated (fizzy) alcoholic drink, such as champagne, will be absorbed faster than a non-carbonated drink.

Alcohol slows your breathing rate, heart rate, and how well your brain functions. These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your ""blood alcohol level."" If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises.

Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The blood alcohol legal limit usually falls between 0.08 and 0.10 in most states. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms.

0.05 -- reduced inhibitions

0.10 -- slurred speech

0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment

0.30 -- confusion

0.40 -- stupor

0.50 -- coma

0.60 -- respiratory paralysis and death

You can have symptoms of ""being drunk"" at blood alcohol levels below the legal definition of being drunk. Also, people who drink alcohol frequently may not have symptoms until a higher blood alcohol level is reached.

HEALTH RISKS OF ALCOHOL

Alcohol increases the risk of:

Alcoholism or alcohol dependence

Falls, drownings, and other accidents

Head, neck, stomach, and breast cancers

Motor vehicle accidents

Risky sex behaviors, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)

Suicide and homicide

Drinking during pregnancy can harm the developing baby. Severe birth defects or fetal alcohol syndrome are possible.

RESPONSIBLE DRINKING

If you drink alcohol, it is best to do so in moderation. Moderation means the drinking is not getting you intoxicated (or drunk) and you are drinking no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman and no more than 2 if you are a man. A drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1 ounces of liquor.

Here are some ways to drink responsibly, provided you do not have a drinking problem, are of legal age to drink alcohol, and are not pregnant:

Never drink alcohol and drive a car.

If you are going to drink, have a designated driver, or plan an alternative way home, such as a taxi or bus.

Do not drink on an empty stomach. Snack before and while drinking alcohol.

If you are taking medication, including over-the-counter drugs, check with your doctor before drinking alcohol. Alcohol can make the effects of many medicines stronger. It can also interact with other medicines, making them ineffective or dangerous or make you sick.

Do not drink if you have a history of alcohol abuse or alcoholism.

If alcoholism runs in your family, you may be at increased risk of developing alcoholism yourself, so you may want to avoid drinking alcohol altogether.

CALL YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IF:

You are concerned about your personal alcohol use or that of a family member

You are interested in more information regarding alcohol use, alcohol abuse , or support groups

, or support groups You are unable to reduce or stop your alcohol consumption, in spite of attempts to stop drinking

Other resources include:

Local Alcoholics Anonymous or Al-anon/Alateen groups

Local hospitals

Public or private mental health agencies

School or work counselors

Student or employee health centers

"New FTII director hints at crackdown on ragging, alcoholism","New FTII director hints at crackdown on ragging, alcoholism",PTI,2016-05-13 00:00:00,"Pune, May 13 (PTI) After witnessing a prolonged unrest, Film And Television Institute of India may be revamped as its new director Bhupendra Kainthola today hinted towards a crackdown on ragging and alcoholism on the campus.

Spelling out his pro-student measures to improve atmosphere on the campus after the scene of 139-day-long strike on the issue of chairmanship of TV actor Gajendra Chauhan drew nought, Kainthola said he would have a ""zero tolerance"" policy for rampant ragging and alcoholism in the premiere institute.

""Although I have not received official complaints of ragging, during my interaction with students, particularly females, I have perceived it is happening and they are scared to go on record to say it. Actually, it has resulted in a decline in the number of female students seeking admission to FTII,"" he told PTI here.

Kainthola, who succeeded Prashant Pathrabe recently, said alcoholism too was taking toll on the health of the students and that he had also ""heard"" of instances of drug abuse on the campus.

""We are going to have a zero tolerance policy for all this. If necessary we will rope in institutions such as Alcoholic Anonymous and de-addiction therapists,"" he said.

Outlining his priorities, the FTII director said a revision of the three-year syllabus was underway and he would ensure that the students completed their three year course without spilling over the prescribed timeline.

""We are recruiting new faculty members and we shall also approach famous film industry personalities to interact with the students as visiting faculty in order to impart practical experience for the would-be industry professionals being trained at the FTII,"" he added.

Asked whether the FTII management had any plans to withdraw the cases filed against a group of students booked in connection with the gherao of former director Pathrabe during the heated atmosphere of the strike against Chauhans appointment, Kainthola said any decision in the matter would be taken after due deliberations.

During the strike, some students had barged into his office of Pathrabe in August last year, objecting to his decision on assessment of 2008 batch projects.

""The matter at present is sub-judice,"" he added.

He said the FTII management was committed to making the institute a centre of academic excellence and there would be no budgetary constraints in procuring necessary equipment and providing necessary facilities to the students to pursue their goals.

Delirium tremens is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that involves sudden and severe mental or nervous system changes.

Alternative Names

DTs; Alcohol withdrawal - delirium tremens

Causes

Delirium tremens can occur when you stop drinking alcohol after a period of heavy drinking, especially if you do not eat enough food.

Delirium tremens may also be caused by head injury, infection, or illness in people with a history of heavy alcohol use.

It is most common in people who have a history of alcohol withdrawal . It is especially common in those who drink 4 - 5 pints of wine or 7 - 8 pints of beer (or 1 pint of ""hard"" alcohol) every day for several months. Delirium tremens also commonly affects people who have had an alcohol habit or alcoholism for more than 10 years.

Symptoms

Symptoms most often occur within 48-96 hours after the last drink. However, they may occur up to 7 - 10 days after the last drink.

Symptoms may get worse quickly, and can include:

Body tremors

Changes in mental function

Agitation, irritability

Confusion , disorientation

, disorientation Decreased attention span

Deep sleep that lasts for a day or longer

Delirium

Excitement

Fear

Hallucinations (seeing or feeling things that are not really there)

(seeing or feeling things that are not really there) Increased activity

Quick mood changes

Restlessness , excitement

, excitement Sensitivity to light, sound, touch

Stupor , sleepiness, fatigue

Seizures (may occur without other symptoms of DTs)

Most common in first 12 - 48 hours after last drink

Most common in people with past complications from alcohol withdrawal

Usually generalized tonic-clonic seizures

Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including:

Anxiety

Depression

Fatigue

Feeling jumpy or nervous

Feeling shaky

Headache

Insomnia (difficulty falling and staying asleep)

Irritability or excitability

Loss of appetite

Nausea

Pale skin

Palpitations (sensation of feeling the heart beat)

(sensation of feeling the heart beat) Rapid emotional changes

Sweating , especially on the palms of the hands or the face

, especially on the palms of the hands or the face Vomiting

Other symptoms that may occur:

Chest pain

Fever

Stomach pain

Exams and Tests

Delirium tremens is a medical emergency.

The health care provider will perform a physical exam. Signs may include:

Heavy sweating

Increased startle reflex

Irregular heartbeat

Problems with eye muscle movement

Rapid heart rate

Rapid muscle tremors

The following tests may be done:

Blood magnesium level

Blood phosphate level

Comprehensive metabolic panel

Electrocardiogram (ECG)

(ECG) Electroencephalogram (EEG)

Toxicology screen

Treatment

The goals of treatment are to:

Save the persons life

Relieve symptoms

Prevent complications

A hospital stay is needed. The health care team will regularly check:

Blood chemistry results, such as electrolyte levels

Body fluid levels

Vital signs (temperature, pulse, rate of breathing, blood pressure)

Symptoms such as agitation, seizures, and irregular heartbeat are treated with the following medications:

Sedatives such as diazepam or lorazepam

Anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital

The patient may need to be put into a sedated state for a week or more until withdrawal and DTs are finished. Benzodiazepine medications such as diazepam or lorazepam also help treat seizures, anxiety, and tremors.

Antipsychotic medications such as haloperidol may sometimes be needed for persons with severe psychotic symptoms, especially if they have an underlying problem such as schizophrenia. However, these drugs should be avoided if possible because they may contribute to seizures.

Long-term preventive treatment should begin after the patient recovers from immediate symptoms. This may involve a ""drying out"" period, in which no alcohol is allowed. Total and lifelong avoidance of alcohol (abstinence) is recommended for most people who go through withdrawal. The person should receive treatment for alcohol use or alcoholism, including:

Counseling

Support groups (such as Alcoholics Anonymous)

The patient should be tested, and if needed, treated for other medical problems that can occur with alcohol use. Such problems may include:

Alcoholic cardiomyopathy

Alcoholic liver disease

Alcoholic neuropathy

Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome

Support Groups

For additional resources, see alcoholism support group .

Outlook (Prognosis)

Delirium tremens is serious and may be life-threatening. Some symptoms related to alcohol withdrawal may last for a year or more, including:

Emotional mood swings

Feeling tired

Sleeplessness

Possible Complications

Injury from falls during seizures

Injury to self or others caused by mental state (confusion/delirium)

Irregular heartbeat, may be life threatening

Seizures

When to Contact a Medical Professional

Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have symptoms. Delirium tremens is an emergency condition.

Prevention

Avoid or reduce the use of alcohol. Get prompt medical treatment for symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.

New studies: Drug abuse among women is no longer a fringe issue,"New studies on substance abuse among women convey a scary message: drug abuse among women is no longer a fringe issue. - Issue Date: May 20, 2002",Shefalee Vasudev,2002-05-20 00:00:00,"The sensational bust of big-time cocaine-seller Ali and businessman Neeraj Wadhera in Delhi last year may have exposed the city's social underbelly. But the most startling revelation was the number of coke-snorting women who figured among Ali's rich clients.

However, the case did nothing to dispel the widely held notion that women hooked to drugs belonged to two extreme ends of the social scale. One, a battered slum dweller or a humiliated sex worker for whom drug addiction means survival. The other, a rich, high society woman who copes with the ""pressures of a demanding life"" by taking drugs.



The glaring omission in the guesstimates was the number of educated, working, middle-class women hooked to drugs. Now, there are definite indicators based on recent trends. Two new studies released last week by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MSJE) and the South Asia regional office of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) as part of a national survey on drug abuse in India, bust the myths around ""the type of women who take drugs"". The theme is academic but the message is clear and alarming-drug abuse among women is not a fringe issue anymore.



A Rapid Assessment Study conducted in nine urban areas as part of the UNDCP project reveals that younger, educated women are more prone to drugs, unsafe injecting methods and sexual practices. One of the findings was that a large number of female drug users were single: 75 per cent in Hyderabad, 60 per cent in Thiruvananthapuram and 75 per cent in Goa.

The respondents from Goa were also highly educated (37 per cent were graduates). What may finally force one to look beyond cliched reasons for drug use is that taking drugs purely for pleasure was one of the reasons women cited for their addiction. The other study was conducted by Dr Pratima Murthy, associate professor of psychiatry at NIMHANS, Bangalore.



""The notion that women take drugs only because of stress is no longer the single, undisputed truth,"" she says, warning that the study figures should not be used to make generalisations about Indian society. However, she does agree that ""drug abuse is becoming popular in the urban middle classes, especially among those who represent India's phase of transition"".



It is also not just the snort of cocaine or the high of heroin that drives women, say mental health professionals. Abuse of prescription drugs from the benzodiazepine group like Alprax, Calmpose, Valium, Trika, Restill, Placedox and Alzolam is a growing trend.

Natasha Singh-the Delhi-based socialite who reportedly consumed a heavy dose of Alprax on a regular basis and died after a fall from a hotel in March this year-obviously wasn't a solitary example. ""I see four to six cases every day involving either dependence on sedatives or abuse,"" says Delhi-based psychiatrist Sanjay Chugh, who thinks escapism is an inescapable urge among urban drug users. Take Namita.

At 1.30 in the morning, just after a party, she realised she had run out of Calmpose. From a smart, amiable hostess in capris and figure-hugging top, Namita turned into an agitated woman who ""wanted"" Calmpose at any cost. ""I take it when I can't sleep, when I'm tense, even when I want to have sex. Sometimes, I take it in the middle of a tension-spiked working day as well. I just can't do without it,"" she says.



Murthy's study covered Delhi, Mumbai and Aizawl and the findings of women on drugs fit the new profile. While the maximum number of women are hooked to brown sugar (see box), other preferred drugs are narcotic analgesics, tranquillisers, alcohol, cough syrups and cannabis. A fact reflected often in the newsmaking trends of Delhi.

In Murthy's study, however, it was in the Manipur capital of Aizawl that narcotic analgesics were the most preferred. According to a Mumbai-based psychotherapist, cocaine is favoured in the city as compared to prescription drugs or sedative painkillers. ""Cocaine reflects status as it is an expensive party drug and women are not sucked into judgmental traps by others in their groups because everybody is using it,"" she says.





While most of the reasons behind women taking to drugs now mirror those of men, everyday life as a drug user or the journey into rehab and back to sobriety is lonelier and tougher for women. Sushma Bhatia*, a 37-year-old educated Delhi housewife, is an alcoholic and a drug addict with two kids and an alcoholic husband. Sharing her experiences in a women's chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Bhatia says her life as an alcoholic is far more devastating in terms of emotional and social consequences than a man's.

Bhatia took to alcohol seven years ago when one day ""I was feeling completely rotten about myself and the way my husband behaved with me after he got drunk"". She experimented with cocaine as well. Soon, she would start drinking after sending her kids to school. One day, after a near-nervous breakdown, she collapsed and had to be carried to a rehab centre.



""Women no longer take drugs only due to stress but also for pleasure.""



For 43-year-old Banita Muralidharan*, a corporate executive, the problem was only alcoholism. She was asked to quit on ""grounds of indecent behaviour"". Muralidharan, who is single, says her friends deserted her, making the urge to kick the addiction very difficult.

""Female addicts are seen as doubly deviant,"" explains Sheigla Murphy, director of the Center for Substance Abuse Studies at the California-based Institute for Scientific Analysis in a report published on the Internet.

This is because traditional expectations of a self-sacrificing woman are at variance with that of a woman so selfish as to use drugs for her own pleasure. Seema Kejriwal*, who, as a supportive wife of an alcoholic, attends AA meetings, agrees.

Kejriwal has stood by her husband, supporting him emotionally and financially for nine years as he battled with his addiction. ""We were reduced to poverty and I had to take a job to support us, leaving my two-year-old son with a man who could not tell the day from night,"" she says, adding that she is fully aware of the fact that had she been in the same situation, her husband would have thrown her out long ago.

Compounding these problems are the effects of drugs on the physical and mental health of women. Studies have proved that women have a higher risk than men to addiction to certain drugs such as crack cocaine, even after casual or experimental use. In Murthy's study, respondents reported insomnia, menstrual irregularities, depression and anxiety.

Some even suffered miscarriages or were forced to undergo pregnancy terminations. ""Pregnant women who take alcohol or abuse drugs,"" says Delhi-based gynaecologist Sohani Verma, ""are also more prone to having children with congenital defects or Foetal Alcohol Syndrome.

While pregnant women on drugs can go into premature labour, babies suffering from FA S are usually underweight and often have defects such as mental retardation, delayed development and, as they grow older, behaviour problems. A scary price to pay for a ""kick"" that only briefly masks the pain of reality.

Alcoholism is sometimes a response to an intolerable situation which can be made more bearable by drinking. Hence the right cure would be to find the root of the problem instead of fighting it with drugs or aversion therapy.

Shimla Vivek Mohan

I am a self-confessed alcoholic. Alcoholism is no respector of any human being. I took my first drink thinking it would bring me more pleasure, more friends, more status but this was only a pleasant delusion. The last five years of my sojourn with alcohol were terrible. I pawned and sold everything to buy more alcohol. I made countless resolutions, broke every one, was hospitalised thrice and underwent psychiatric treatment. Nothing made a difference. Only Alcoholics Anonymous did. Their one day at a time rule is indeed a golden rule.

Bombay Ganesh

Drinking has become a social necessity and man's social status seems to rise or fall with the quality and quantity of liquor he is able to hand out. A non-drinker finds himself isolated at any function and to be accepted as a civilised individual he begins to drink. Even more distressing is the fact that youngsters have taken to it in a big way simply because it is equated with manliness.

Chandrapur Prakash Prabharat

I believe that Hindi films contribute largely to the growing popular appeal of drinking in this country. Nearly every film has the hero guzzling booze (generally a bottle of Vat 69) and looking very pleased with himself. The same man is shown young and carefree, dancing with the heroine, righting all manner of people in the most outrageous situations for his self-respect. And finally comes tragedy. The audience identifies with him and imitates him completely, even throwing back drinks like he did, not bothering to see the bottle for its evil.

Rajkot D.P. Bhatt

The cover story did not shock, it only surprised. It is only expected that alcoholism will increase with population. This means that there is more frustration and deterioration of morals. Eradication is impossible.

Bombay S.E. Meeuza

An alcoholic is not just the problem of his family but should also be the concern of the society in general. As he is a public nuisance, neighbours should join together to humiliate him. This method has been successful in Manipur, where the women have got together to deal with the problem.

Nagpur Manoj Bire

Alcoholism is a socially accepted evil which has assumed insidious dimensions. Only a mass-based movement, which by its very nature enjoys wide popular backing, can help the people in their battle against the bottle.

Pathankot Ravi Kant Bhatia

Your intention to educate people about alcoholism is well-timed. Arrack sale legalised a few years back in Tamil Nadu has unfortunately increased the number of its consumers. Alcoholics, many of them in a highly inebriated state, can now be seen drinking till the wee hours in arrack shops. The income generated is enormous and all this at the expense of the working class whose women and children suffer.

Nandanam Franklyn Stanley

Considering the climate in this country, alcohol is injurious to drinkers. But the state governments will not bring in total prohibition. The lobby of vested interests argues that prohibition will only be an incentive to illicit distilling and bootlegging, which is a loss to the Government. This is a fallacious argument for the brewing of raw drink is common and uncontrolled. Illicit distillation is mainly on economic grounds and has nothing to do with prohibition.

Bombay D.P. Birla

In north-eastern India alcohol has become the root cause of all evil in society. Country liquor is cheaply and freely available and has devastating effects. Facilities for de-addiction should be provided in this part of the country too.

Absurd Reading

Reading your story ""Communal Cauldron"", April 30), one would imagine that the Hindus went on a rampage merely because they were working under the Muslims who controlled the business. That sounds absurd because the losses of the other community have not been considered a loss, and neither has the viewpoint of the oppressing community been taken. Had there been violence on the scale you write about there would have been a retaliatory strike.

Black Politicos

One hoped that the CBI would move onto politicians after raiding the bureaucracy (""Exposing the Bureaucracy"", April 30). Politics in India is the biggest black market business. Politicians with declared incomes of less than Rs 3,000 lead extravagant lives. They shout about black money in public but pocket their share in private.

Gimmicky Rule

Goa minister Ramesh Tawadkar on Tuesday took a U-turn after his remarks on giving treatment for LGBT community to make them ""normal"" triggered a row.

Ramesh Tawadkar claimed he was misquoted even as Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar did some damage control to say homosexuality is not a ""disease"".

""I was misunderstood and misquoted. I was not talking about the LGBT (youths) but about drug addicted and sexually abused youths,"" Tawadkar told PTI, as local channels in Goa continued to air the footage in which he assured medical treatment to LGBT youths to make them ""normal"".

""Youth policy speaks about drug addicted youths and sexually abused youths as a focused group. There are provisions in the central government sponsored Social Justice Scheme for such youths which can be implemented in Goa,"" the Sports and Youth Affairs minister said, a day after he was widely criticised for his statements.

He said when journalists asked him about LGBTs(Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transgenders), he told them, ""I am not expert on the issue.""

The minister also refused to acknowledge LGBT as a focused group, though the youth policy document which is currently in public domain has mentioned them as one.

""We will make them normal. We will have a centre for them. Like Alcoholic Anonymous centres, we will have centres. We will train them and give them medicines too,"" the minister had said.

""Like in the case of other target groups such as juvenile offenders, drug afflicted youth, marginalised or migrant youth, geographically disadvantaged youth, a detailed survey would be carried out among state LGBT community, so that their problems could be specifically addressed,"" he had added.

In a damage control exercise, Parsekar said, ""Homosexuality is a natural thing, it is not a disease...It could be ignorance. Probably, he might have thought of some other question and reacted.""

Asked what was the state government's stand on homosexuality, he said, ""it is a natural thing"".

The row broke out even as visiting UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon strongly opposed the criminalisation of homosexuality in India, saying that doing so breeds intolerance by violating basic rights to privacy and freedom.

Reacting to Tawadkar's remarks, noted fashion designer Wendell Rodricks said the minister was trying to divert attention from the main issues by talking such things.

""There are lot of other issues which need urgent attention in Goa. They should concentrate on real issues like corruption, illegal constructions, drug mafia, lawlessness and others,"" said Wendell.

Wendell also took to Twitter to lodge his protest over and said, ""They seem #lost in the #Goa mist. Talk about quick backtrack on the #LGBT #treatment #centres in Goa.

In another tweet he wrote, ""Another#U-turn by the #morons vis a vis the #LGBT #treatment #centres in #Goa.""

She was severely ill and has been sent to hospital.",Ram Kinkar Singh,2019-04-06 00:00:00,"The neighbours said they have seen the father put liquor in his daughter's milk bottle and force fed her. (Representational Image)

A three-year-old girl was rescued by Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) in Delhi's Prem Nagar. The minor was found lying in a pool of excreta in her room. She was severely ill. She looked pale and her alcoholic father was asleep next to her.

The DCW rescued the minor after receiving an anonymous complaint that a minor girl in Prem Nagar area was not fed for the last three days by her father.

The DCW team found her father sleeping in the same room which was filled with empty liquor bottles. When they tried to wake him up, he got violent.

The DCW team then called the police and took the duo -- the father and child -- to the Prem Nagar police station. However, no FIR has been registered so far in the matter.

The neighbors informed DCW that the father, a rickshaw puller, was a drunkard and would not wake up for hours while his daughter wept due to hunger and the filth inside the room.

The child's mother died a year ago and the father was drunk all the time, the neighbours told the DCW team. He would leave the girl alone in the room whenever he went to work and did not allow his neighbours to help him.

The neighbours said they have seen the father put liquor in his daughter's milk bottle and force fed her.

The DCW team has admitted the minor to a nearby hospital where the doctors informed that the child's private parts are infected due to poor hygiene. She would be shifted to a shelter home once she is discharged from the hospital.

DCW's Kiran Negi and Vandana Singh have taken up the matter with the Delhi Commissioner of Police (DCP) and asked him why no FIR has been registered and the father not been arrested so far.

DCW chairperson Swati Maliwal expressed shock over the incident and urged the Delhi Police to take immediate action against the father.

""I applaud the man who called DCW's women helpline and helped us rescue this child who has undergone extreme trauma both in terms of the loss of her mother and an uncaring and alcoholic father,"" Swati Maliwal said.

""It's shocking that the child was given alcohol by her own father and has such extreme injury marks on her body. Alcoholism is the worst disease. Police should immediately take the strongest action against the father,"" Maliwal said.","['neighbours', 'drunk', 'father', 'minor', 'dcw', 'covered', 'maliwal', 'rescued', 'liquor', 'nagar', 'prem', 'excreta', 'team', 'girl', 'milk', 'feed', 'used', 'room', 'delhi']","The neighbours said they have seen the father put liquor in his daughter's milk bottle and force fed her.

Sweeping social changes and new role models give dramatic rise in teenage crime,"With more and more teenagers from well-to-do families turning to crime, tremors of shock are rippling through Indian society. - Issue Date: Jul 31, 1992",RAMESH MENON,1992-07-31 00:00:00,"Four rich schoolboys killed an executive for money as they wanted to go on a holiday Four rich schoolboys killed an executive for money as they wanted to go on a holiday Kokila Vora had barely opened the door of her Bombay flat to let in her son 's five schoolmates when they stabbed her 13 times till she dropped dead. Then they killed her dog, tried to set the house on fire after leaving the gas stove on to destroy evidence and decamped with valuables worth Rs 2.5 lakh. All were under 16, from rich, respectable families and had done a professional job of the murder. The reason: they had run up debts of thousands of rupees through a lavish life-style, visiting brothels and five-star hotels.

Manoj Fafri, son of a senior Delhi administration official; Gaurav Kumar, son of a director of a research institute; and Somesh Tripathi, grandson of the late Kamlapati Tripathi; took Robin, a close friend for a drive. On a lonely stretch, they stabbed him to death. Reason: he was carrying Rs 45,000.

Bored during their vacations, four rich boys who had just appeared for their high school exams in Delhi raided a house hoping to get jewellery and cash. Failing to find any, they cold-bloodedly tortured and killed owner Prem Gopal Nair by repeatedly ducking his head into a bucket of insecticide. Ten days later, they attempted another robbery, but were caught. They told the police that they wanted money to go to Mussoorie with their girlfriends.

Sweeping social changes and new role models have combined to fuel a dramatic rise in teenage crime, causing concern to the police, sociologists and, above all bewildered parents.

Sudipa Pal, 17, a ninth standard student in Calcutta, fed her parents and grandparents sweets mixed with poison after testing them on a pig. When they were dead, she tied all of them with electric wire and connected it to the mains to make it look like mass suicide. She eliminated them in the expectation that they would hinder her relationship with her tutor Randhir Bose, 51. She showed no sign of remorse. Appearing for her tenth standard exams shortly after, she scored distinction marks.





Robbery. Murder. Rape. Car thefts. Kidnapping for ransom. These are crimes expected of hardened criminals. Not of your respectable neighbour's 17-year-old son, or your mild-spoken college-going nephew.

Or even your own daughter. Youngsters you trusted and knew), But with more and more teenagers from well-to-do families turning to crime, tremors of shock are rippling through Indian society, tor some youngsters, it is a shortcut to riches.

Others, already rich, are bored teenagers looking for kicks. Whatever their motives, the facts are alarming enough to leave police and psychologists perplexed, parents anguished and schoolmates mystified.

After his schoolmates killed Vora, Kapil Anand, 19, went into a state of depression and shock as he could not believe they could do it: ""I wondered if I could trust my friends because I just could not fathom how these cool rich guys could do this. No one suspected them.""

Crack police teams in Calcutta did not suspect the nubile, but innocent-looking Pal of having the audacity to murder her parents and grandparents either.

Says a police officer: ""Even after arresting her, we kept wondering if we had gone wrong somewhere."" Adds Neeraj Kumar, senior superintendent of police in Delhi: ""We can crack down on crime and criminals. But how do we control a sociological phenomenon driving teenagers to crime?""

He is referring to the fact that youngsters are more violent than ever before. They are in the forefront of riots and political violence. Campus crime has become too commonplace to shock. Their role models are Arun Gawli and Dawood Ibrahim. Many of these young criminals are not lumpen elements but bright youngsters looking for quick money to finance flashy life-styles.

Out of 61.2 7 lakh officially registered crimes throughout the country in 1990, over 32.87 lakh were committed by those under 30. In metros like Delhi and Bombay as many as 70 per cent of those arrested for various crimes are under 25.

In Bombay, 71 per cent of dacoities, 77 per cent of robberies and 74 per cent of murders were perpetrated by those under 25.

Five years ago, there were just two or three teenagers involved in dacoities in Calcutta every year. Now it is more than ten times that figure. Points out Ajit Ghosh, Calcutta's deputy commissioner of police: ""Today's major criminals are aged between 18 and 22.""

Even smaller places are seeing the trend. Eric Ekka, jailor at Sajiwa, Imphal, observes: ""Ruthless youngsters are seeing crime as a new way of life."" Of the 610 prisoners at his jail, 80 per cent are in their 20s.

Criminologists and sociologists are worried that it can only get worse. Why are normal teenagers taking to crime? Experts offer a host of reasons but generalisations are often too superficial.

Criminologist Shubral Sanyal of the National Institute of Criminology and Forensic Science (NICFS) in Delhi believes that most affluent teenagers are lapsing into crime as a way of wreaking revenge on uncaring parents.

""Youth with incomplete lives fall into deviant behaviour to gratify themselves. The danger of crime makes them feel alive.""

Dayal Mirchandani Bombay Psychiatrist

Indifference and abuse instead of attention and affection can make emotional cripples of children. This cycle then culminates in deviant behaviour. Bombay psychiatrist Dayal Mirchandani says: ""Youngsters leading dissatisfied and incomplete lives get into deviant behaviour to gratify themselves. The excitement derived gives them a feeling of being alive.""



Others blame it on social changes. Criminologist James Vadackumchery who works in Trivandrum believes: ""When society itself is becoming criminal and escapist, how can we expect our youngsters to behave differently?""

In a way, the teenager is only reflecting the chaos and aggression in society, its acquisitive urges, and the degeneration of values.

The youth see cheats triumphing in exams, degrees being auctioned and jobs not necessarily going to the best candidate. This was best exemplified by the Mandal agitation during which scores of students in Delhi took to the streets and indulged in wanton violence.

Many made human torches of themselves, frustrated that their merit and hard work were no longer valid criteria for college admissions and jobs.

Today's youngster is cynical, angry, desperate. He sees gangster politicians, smugglers and underworld dons - even parents - getting rich and powerful through dubious means. Points out T.K. Oommen of the Centre for the Study of Social Systems at the Jawaharlal Nehru University: ""Before Independence, youngsters had a sense of purpose, fighting for freedom.

But after that, values crumbled, corruption became institutionalised and anti-social elements grew in stature with illegitimate money. Catapulted into powerful positions, they commanded respect. The message sent out to the young was that this was the way of the world.""

Says eminent sociologist M.N. Srinivas: ""We have not really taken the trouble to understand the teenage mind. How can we just blame them? Society itself has become violent and materialistic. Parents rarely empathise with their children, talk to them, help them out with their confusion or neutralise their frustrations.""



Nuclear families are increasingly characterised by working parents who are treading a tightrope between home and work. While they spend lavishly on their children, they can end up denying them the care and the time they need, not to mention the discipline which has to be inculcated in the early years. Children who feel emotionally abandoned look elsewhere for companionship and acceptance.

Take the case of three rich college girls from Shertallai in Kerala. Anju Joseph, 17, Sindhu Thomas, 18, and Safeena, 19, left home feeling lonely and angry. They wanted companionship and excitement.

When the police caught up with them, they were part of an underworld gang in Goa. ""They were so mild-mannered. I still can't understand why they did it,"" says a friend of the trio.

Wealthy Sirhan Shah, 19, who lives on Peddar Road in Bombay, stole three motorcycles and a Maruti car. Sirhan told the police that though his family had a car, he wanted his own, like his peers.

For parents, seeing their children take to crime is traumatic. Teacher Shetram Mishra was stunned when his son, Siddhivinayak, 20, was arrested for forging a Rs 30,000-cheque: ""I have lost self-respect. But how can I disown him?""

""Fear of the law has gone. Some trials take place after years. With the collapse of the judicial system, youth believe crime pays.""

Subramaniam Ramamurthy

Bombay Police Commissioner

Divorce and separation add to the problem. Studies at Nirmala Niketan show that 60 per cent of juvenile delinquents come from broken families. Says Mohan Issac, assistant professor of psychiatry at nimhans: ""Squabbling parents are poor role models. Invariably, teenage criminals reflect the sorry situation at home.""

Akram, 14, is a perfect example. His nights were often spent on Bombay's pavements to escape abuse from his alcoholic father. Eventually, he fell into the company of teenage criminals who stole car carburettors. ""My father drove me to crime,"" he says.

Abdul Sajid, 17, caught for house-breaking, hates his father who left when he was 10: ""I don't even want to see him."" Psychiatrist Shoba Srinath believes the only solution is for families to devote quality time to children and play an intimate role in their emotional growth.

Police agree that most teenage criminals have emotional problems at home, primarily a communication problem with their parents. In New Delhi, police found that the millionaire parents of four school students involved in car stereo thefts had never bothered to find out why they stayed out late.

They accused the police of framing their sons till the evidence was produced: stacks of car stereos in their children's rooms which they were unaware of. The students said they did it ""for fun and adventure"".



Police brutality hardens the young ones Police brutality hardens the young ones

In today's parlance, fun for a teenager could mean anything. For Nakul Wahi, Dhruv Goyal, Sanjeev Jacob and Amar Upadhyaya, all from rich Delhi families, it meant driving a Maruti to Agra, wearing masks, and entering the house of ophthalmologist N.N. Aggarwal. They held him at gunpoint and looted cash and jewellery worth Rs 2.5 lakh while one of them sat in the car with a walkie-talkie set.

When the police caught them, they discovered that the gang was well equipped and very well organised. The bottle of chloroform, the nylon ropes, the surgical gloves, the face masks and the pistol showed only too depressingly that their crimes were committed in cold blood and with total calculation.



Says Pune-based lawyer-activist Aroona Nafday Goswami: ""Trying to be westernised, many parents keep away from their children's rooms to give them 'space'. So they have no idea what their children are seeing on the video or doing in their spare time. With modern-day pressures and values, parents find little time to instill discipline or respect for the law.""

In Delhi, minors often drive cars to school. When the police hauled up dozens of such children outside Modern School, they nonchalantly paid the fines. Says Sub-Inspector Laxman Wagh in Bombay: ""Rich children feel everything can be bought. Even acquittal.""

In the first half of March, Delhi Police cracked down on 323 children below 18. Traffic Commissioner Maxwell Pereira says criminally indulgent parents encourage such acts which symbolise how rich children are encouraged to fool around with the law.

Says Madhava Menon, director of the National Law School of India University at Bangalore: ""Parents should be penalised as they should be responsible for what their children do.""

""Young criminals can be reformed by social workers rather than the police as their circumstances need to be investigated, not the crime.""

Today, the formative years of a child are frittered away in a fast-moving world. While scholastic performance grabs the limelight, the emotional development is ignored. Personality profiles done by Bombay counsellor Shenaz Elavia on teenagers with criminal tendencies indicated poorly developed personalities.

When children internalise their anxieties, they suffer emotional disorders. When they externalise them, they become anti-social - stubborn, aggressive and violent.

Fuelling this trend is the breakdown of the system of criminal justice. Convictions take an eternity. When a case finally comes to trial, witnesses are untraceable.

Teenagers arrested 20 years ago in Calcutta are yet to be convicted. Bombay Commissioner of Police Subramaniam Ramamurthy echoes a common concern: ""With the collapse of the criminal justice system, the message now is that crime pays.""

Teacher Rukmani Srinivas in Bangalore says that students ridicule her when she talks of honesty as a value. They ask why they can't think of striking it rich when Harshad Mehta can make his millions and politicians get kickbacks. ""Twenty years ago, we wanted to work hard and build a career. Today, teenagers are looking for quick wealth,"" says K. Srinivas, inspector-general of police, Bangalore.

Adolescence can often be a tremendously traumatic phase, with its agonies, frustrations, rages and uncertainties too easily underestimated by parents and laughed off by society.

Peer pressure is overpowering and unless parents exert their own influence, youngsters whose characters are yet to crystalise can be swayed by friends' values in their desperation to win approval.

Tongminthang, 20, from Churachandpur, Manipur, broke away from drug addiction during a jail term in a drug-related case. But once free, he was dragged back into it by peer pressure. He found himself part of a gang stealing to finance their addiction, and is in jail again.

If drugs are inflating juvenile crime figures, so is terrorism. Terrorists have always found it easy to lure teenagers in Punjab, Kashmir and the North-east. As Peter Ngahanyui, dig Crime, at Imphal, points out: ""Being between the ages of 16 and22, they are easy to indoctrinate.""

Frankee Sema, 19, was lured from Kohima into a banned insurgent organisation. Carried away by ideological fervour at a camp in Burma, he was more than happy to rob a Shillong bank at gunpoint.

But most criminologists argue that the prime motive for teenage crime is quick and easy money. Says B.N. Chattoraj, a professor at NICFS: ""Nowadays, the accent is on money and no one cares how it is acquired. So teenagers opt for the easiest way out as working hard is no longer the way to get it.""

Crime files in every city have hundreds of examples: Mohanraj ,19, thought his hosiery unit job at Tirupur in Tamil Nadu would never make him rich. So he wrote an anonymous note to five-year-old actress Shyamlee saying that he had been paid Rs 50,000 to kill her and if she paid him Rs 1 lakh, he would eliminate her enemy. As he walked into a police trap, he confessed: ""I wanted to get rich quick.""

The brutality involved can be chilling. Viswajeet, Vajpayee, Neeraj and Pawan had yet to turn 18 when they took a friend Arun Thapa, 16, to a secluded area in Delhi, hit him on the head with an iron rod till he died and threw him into a well. They did this as Thapa was demanding part of the money they had made from selling his mother's jewellery - itself stolen.

Or consider the case of an army officer in Delhi numbed by the horror of his dynamic, popular young son taking to murder. At school, girls doted on him, cajoling him to take them out for coffee at the nearby Oberoi.

Entertaining was expensive, Vikram Ramphal soon realised. He was drawn into the easiest way to make a fast buck - crime. Beginning with stealing video cassette recorders, he graduated to robberies carried out at knife-point.



""Teenagers with criminal tendencies are merely reflecting the increasingly violent and materialistic side of society.""

M.N. Srinivas Bangalore Sociologist



But when he cleaned up jewellery and cash worth Rs 3 lakh from his family doctor's house, the police caught up with him. A jail sentence at Tihar merely hardened him. Soon after his release, he knifed to death R.P. Tuli, a rich New Delhi businessman, while robbing his house. When he was jailed again, he had yet to celebrate his 20th birthday. His parents have yet to recover from the shock.

Parents agree that children today demand huge sums of pocket money. They take pride in discussing how their school-going children need over Rs 100 a day. Points out Kumar: ""The idea of entertainment has changed. We used to go to the theatre, listen to music or read. But today the youngster wants to be seen eating and shopping at upmarket places.""

When the high-profile Vasavi Vidya Niketan School in Bangalore warned the parents of Balaji and Suraj, both 16, that they should not give their sons over a thousand rupees as pocket money, they were ignored. Balaji reportedly asked schoolmates Lathendra, 20, Bhaskar, 19 and Mahesh, 18, to kill Suraj after paying them Rs 3,500 and promising them more.

The three did just that. Balaji, the son of a grain merchant, said he wanted to take revenge on Suraj's parents for squabbling with his parents. For his classmates and teachers, this was almost unconceivable for they never thought the frail, bespectacled Balaji could be so vicious.

In fact, the most troubling aspect of teenage crime is the senseless brutality. When Madhavi, 5, was kidnapped from Shakarpur in Delhi, her family found comfort only in close friend Ramesh, 22.

He came every day to console the family and plead that they pay the Rs-4,000 ransom. But when he offered to talk to the kidnappers and got Madhavi's clothes as evidence, the family informed the police.

By then, he had killed her. Jhula, a 16-year-old orphan, was given all he wanted by his grandfather Bipin Sen. But when he demanded a motorcycle, Sen refused, arguing it was dangerous to drive in Calcutta. Jhula beat him to death. In Kanpur, two teenagers battered a cobbler because he didn't repair their chappals on time.

Why has the teenager imbibed so much violence? Sociologists cite the overdose in films and on satellite television as the main reason. By the time the Indian child is in his teens, he has seen thousands of brutal acts on television and video.

When Chandan, a Bangalore medical student, strangled his uncle to death in a car for the Rs 1 lakh he carried, he did it exactly the way he had seen it in The Godfather.

Social workers and counsellors feel jailing and institutionalising youngsters are not the solutions. Families should be helped to establish a rapport with them, rebuilding a sense of values and purpose. Jails only corrupt them further. Calcutta's Deputy Commissioner of Police Prasun Mukherjee, is trying counselling.

When Arvind Sen, a 10th standard student from a well-placed family in Calcutta was picked up by the police for stealing eight two-wheelers, Mukherjee did not arrest him. Instead, he counselled him and his parents who, all too predictably, could not believe it. They realised they had lost touch with their son as they were too busy with their careers.

The real challenge lies in the years ahead. Little can be gained from pointing an accusing finger at the teenager alone. Society needs to take a hard, careful look at itself and the values it is promoting.

""With modern day pressures and values, parents have little time to instill discipline or respect for the law in their children.""

As Srinivas points out tartly, we cannot sit back and pride ourselves on being a religious and spiritually-inclined society unless we take on the burden of instilling the right values in our children and taking concrete steps to stem the flood of materialism.

It is too easy to disclaim responsibility for the crimes and misdemeanours of the next generation. Unless society believes these young criminals are inherently wicked, it should respond to their cries for help.","['models', 'sweeping', 'role', 'parents', 'children', 'teenage', 'dramatic', 'crime', 'changes', 'rich', 'delhi', 'youngsters', 'rise', 'social', 'wanted', 'rs', 'teenagers', 'money']","They told the police that they wanted money to go to Mussoorie with their girlfriends.

Talking about the show, he said it took a lot of time to convert the idea into reality.

""The idea had been brewing in my mind for a long time. I was offered a game show by Star television, which I refused. When I suggested Satyamev Jayate, the television network agreed. We started out with a very small team, and were convinced that we would do the project only if our research was impeccable.""

Aamir said that the show changed his perspective towards life. Aamir said that the show changed his perspective towards life.

Admitting that he never anticipated such an overwhelming response to the show, Khan aid that the aim of the latest episode which focused on sports was to exhort children to dump their video games and go out in the open. ""It is so disturbing that they have forgotten how to play under harsh elements. Outdoor sports are also about socialising and realising the importance of team play. Besides, look at the violence in digital games. It's so sad to see the younger generation getting addicted to them. Schools are also to be blamed. Tell me, which school treats sports as an integral part of mainstream education?"" he asked.

Stressing that being part of the show is his ""contribution"" towards making the society aware of the ills plaguing it, Khan is clear, ""I don't have any false assumptions that I can change the country or the society. But yes, I can tell a story, make people aware, make them see what they refuse to. No single individual can be the harbinger of instrumental change. It is always a collective process. But always remember, when you give people information, you give them a peculiar power that can go a long way in making things change for the better.""

Smiling that entering politics is the last thing on his mind, Khan, who offered to be the brand ambassador of the Clean India campaign and ascertains zero waste in his office tells that ""happiness"" keeps him motivated. ""I do only those projects which promise to excite me no end. That's precisely the reason that I give 100 per cent to whatever I do. Happiness is not about a fat cheque but a constant kick that keeps you going,"" he said.

Refusing to elaborate on the themes of upcoming shows of Satyamev Jayate, the actor is happy that his show has forced the state machinery to take major steps. ""Look at the Child Protection Bill, which has been passed by the Parliament. Do you know that 40 lakh children called the child helpline number after our show on child abuse was aired.

'Drunchies' behind youth obesity epidemic,'Drunchies' behind youth obesity epidemic,Press Trust of India,2018-08-08 00:00:00,"Washington, Aug 8 (PTI) Drunchies, or the desire to eat salty, unhealthy foods after a night of heavy drinking, may be contributing to the obesity epidemic among college students, scientists say.

Researchers from University at Buffalo in the US decided to look at a sample of 286 college students to better understand how drinking affects what they eat, both that night and for their first meal the next day when, most likely, they are hungover.

""Given the obesity epidemic and the rates of alcohol consumption on college campuses, we need to be aware of not only the negative effect of alcohol consumption, but also the impact it has on what people are eating while they are drinking,"" said Jessica Kruger, an assistant professor at the University at Buffalo.

Research on the effects of drinking and diet is scarce, Kruger said, adding that eating more unhealthy foods following alcohol consumption is an often overlooked behaviour in traditional addiction research.

The inspiration for the study, published in the Californian Journal of Health Promotion, came from an ad researchers saw in a university newspaper.

""It said, 'Got Drunchies?' and had ads for pizza, tacos, and other fast-food places that were open late after the bars closed,"" Kruger said.

An average beer contains 150 calories. If a person drinks five beers, it accounts for third of their daily energy intake. Add two slices of pizza or a burrito to that at the end of the night, and it's a recipe for weight gain, she said.

""So, we dug a bit deeper and first figured out what the 'drunchies' were, and then decided this would be interesting to study,"" Kruger said.

Study participants were asked to complete an anonymous online survey.

Researchers found that drinking influenced study participants' dietary behaviours before going to bed.

All alcohol drinkers were more likely to eat something before they went to bed after drinking alcohol than in general before they go to bed.

Specifically, they were more likely to opt for salty snack foods and pizza. Healthy foods, such as dark green vegetables and other veggies they would ordinarily eat, were not as appealing.

Of particular concern, the researchers noted, was the fact that participants did not report drinking more water or other non-alcoholic beverages before bed.

That exacerbates dehydration, which may lead to additionally unhealthy food choices.

The following day after drinking, participants' dietary patterns varied from the night before. They were less likely to skip meals the morning after a night of drinking compared to a typical morning.

They favoured foods like pizza or tacos over milk and dairy products and grains, most likely because of the so-called hangover cures that get passed down to students and which entail eating foods that ""soak up"" the alcohol.

Dispelling these myths is one way to promote a healthy diet even after a night of binge drinking, Kruger said. PTI MHN MHN","['university', 'drinking', 'kruger', 'drunchies', 'obesity', 'eat', 'participants', 'night', 'alcohol', 'youth', 'pizza', 'foods', 'likely', 'epidemic']","Washington, Aug 8 (PTI) Drunchies, or the desire to eat salty, unhealthy foods after a night of heavy drinking, may be contributing to the obesity epidemic among college students, scientists say.

Alarming number of youngsters in Indian cities take to drinking,"Egged on by peers and condoned by indulgent parents an alarming number of youngsters in Indian cities are taking to the bottle. And chasing their own doom. - Issue Date: Apr 10, 2000",Robin Abreu,2000-04-10 00:00:00,"Every fifth college student in Delhi drinks regularly. About three lakh teenagers can't kick the habit and one lakh need treatment. Every fifth college student in Delhi drinks regularly. About three lakh teenagers can't kick the habit and one lakh need treatment.

The parents were influential, the police turned silent and the incident got an official burial. But in Bangalore they still talk about it and with every telling the room turns cold with fear.

Five Bangalore boys decide to board a bus bound for Goa. One boy has stolen Rs 1.5 lakh from his parents to fund the trip. One of them gets cold feet and tips off the police. The errant four are found in Hubli, completely drunk. They are all 13 years old. They were going, they say, ""to drink and then die in Goa"".

Maybe that isn't chilling enough, so try this then. At 15, Sanjay Kumar was drinking Scotch. His father, a building contractor in Delhi wanted his son to ""live like a king"". This is a short story. At 19, the ""king"" was dead. Inebriated at a new year's party he drove his Zen into a pole.

The stories are getting gruesome, the evidence is mounting, the message is stark: teenage drinking is spiralling out of control. Drunk children in their shiny new cars with an alcohol-induced disdain for the law are worrying policemen.

Since January 1999, when the Chandigarh Police acquired a breath analyser, 226 people have been challaned for drunk driving. Nearly 40 per cent of them were teenagers. Similarly, the Maharashtra Police statistics show that in 1999 there were 244 accidents linked to teenagers who had imbibed a peg too many. Many of the accidents were fatal.

Teenagers, with no ID in hand, are streaming into liquor shops to buy their bottle of choice. Daljit Singh of Calcutta's Empire Stores says he gets an average of 60 teenage customers a day. ""They come during the daytime, and buy either canned beer or white drinks like vodka which are easy to conceal.""

Youngsters arriving at school with the stale smell of beer on their breath are not completely unknown. In Calcutta the principal of one of the city's posh schools suspended a boy for drinking on the campus.

In Delhi, Rajesh Kumar, then 15, drove to school with his friends, all clearly inebriated, and was thrown out. Today, with a history of deviant behaviour like locking his parents out of the house because they refused to give him a Gypsy, he is an alcoholic undergoing counselling. He is only 17.

Psychiatrists across the country are alarmed by this sudden spurt in teenage alcoholism. Delhi psychologist Dr Achal Bhagat puts it starkly, ""Alcoholism is becoming a lifestyle for teenagers"". In Chennai, Dr Gopalakrishnan at Chennai's Apollo Hospitals says, ""Children are misinterpreting a mug of beer for a fashion fad.""

He has six to 10 troubled teenage drinkers visiting him every month. Society in its ambivalence may pass it off as youthful indiscretion but it is far more serious than that. Alcohol routinely destroys brain cells, binge drinking can kill - in Bangalore, 17 youngsters drank all night late last year to find one of their friends dead in his own vomit the next morning - and the liver begins to malfunction.

Research by the WHO says that one out of 25 drinkers turns into an alcoholic. That's a scary statistic considering that alcoholics are 50 to 100 times more prone to commit suicide. As R. Kumar, a counsellor at the Bangalore chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous, confirms, ""We have more and more young people coming to us with drinking problems.""

Beyond the health impact is a larger social problem: young drinkers who move from use to abuse find their grades dropping, their interpersonal relationships turning sour and they often resort to deviant behaviour.

Says Harsh Vardhan, former health minister of Delhi and currently adviser to WHO's regional director for South-East Asia: ""When teenagers drink they damage their physical and mental growth. They are in fact chasing death.""

Almost half the 3,000 schoolchildren surveyed in Mumbai felt that alcohol was not harmful and that it enhanced self-confidence. Almost half the 3,000 schoolchildren surveyed in Mumbai felt that alcohol was not harmful and that it enhanced self-confidence.

The malaise is rooted in the societal acceptance of alcohol and society's indulgent view towards teenagers knocking down the odd peg. Unlike drugs that have an alarming connotation to them, a frothy glass of beer is hardly taboo.

If anything, there is a conspicuous absence of deterring messages. The images that waft into living rooms through cable television seem to promote the idea that a swig of beer equals youthful exuberance. Instead of public caution over alcohol's harmful effects, the signals are positive.

It's hard to convict Shah Rukh Khan for sauntering through a Bagpiper advertisement or Ajay Jadeja for dancing for Kingfisher, but there's no one there to interpret the message for children who go wide-eyed at what their heroes are doing. As psychiatrist Dr Debashish Bhattacharya explains, ""Teenagers have several mistaken notions about drinking: that it is masculine, it enhances the sex drive and that achievers do it.""

Hanging around at home with 17-year-old friends and posturing over a whisky bottle, or popping into a bar for an illegal pitcher of beer because it's hep, is common conduct among teenagers. For a generation of sensation seekers with an extremely low threshold of boredom, this is terrific pastime.

As Shruti, an 18-year-old pub-goer from Chandigarh, says, ""Beer is not an intoxicant. It's a social lubricant."" Alcohol becomes an excuse for everything. If you're too shy to talk to a girl, rum will give you courage; if you're not fitting in with your peers what's a vodka if it means acceptance.

Peer pressure as always can be tortuous and as Deepa, a fresher at a Mumbai college puts it, ""If you say no you could be alone for the entire evening and labelled a spoilsport. So what's the big deal in a couple of beers?"" Dilip, a third-year student explains soothingly, ""The next morning the maximum you have is a headache.""

If only it was that simple. Sanjay Sahney knows, for he too began with a glass of beer just to be part of the crowd. An engineering student in Mumbai, the metropolis was a different world for this insular Indore boy.

No parents to note his movements, a rich girlfriend who enjoyed frequenting the city's hot spots, life was that cliched ""big party"", he says. Except that one glass of beer grew to a bottle, one bottle grew to four a day. ""I used to crave for the high because it left me happy.""

Except that his grades slipped and he fell into debt, till a student counsellor sent him to Seva Dan, an NGO that works with alcohol and drug abusers. Today, eight months later, Sahney is limping back to normalcy.

In the heat of the moment, young men are too busy to realise that the confidence a bellyful of beer brings is entirely false and often dangerous. They strut out of bars ready to do Michael Schumacher impersonations on city roads only to wind up sober in the morgue.

Similarly, a brain addled by too many whiskies emboldens shy young men and leads them into risky sexual behaviour. ""They consume alcohol to get the confidence ... and then they visit prostitutes,"" says Sekhar Sheshadri, additional professor of psychiatry, NIMHANS. A scary corollary to this is another NIMHANS study which reveals that 70 per cent of HIV patients are alcoholics, especially teenagers.

The best way to control the problem is to make it more difficult for youngsters to find a drink. Liquor shops must insist on proof of age. The best way to control the problem is to make it more difficult for youngsters to find a drink. Liquor shops must insist on proof of age.

As alcohol abuse grows it becomes a significant crutch and much like Asterix, young people believe that one sip of this magic potion is all it takes. A survey of 3,000 class 10 students by Seva Dan in 13 schools in Mumbai revealed some frightening figures.

Forty-eight per cent of the children didn't think that alcohol was harmful, 47 per cent said it helped gain confidence and 52 per cent said it helped decrease mental tension.

If parents are slow to recognise their child is stressed, they take a mild view if their children toss back a few even if they haven't reached the legal age. As Panjab University sociologist Rajesh Gill says, ""It's no longer stigmatised."" The comments are not out of place.

A fortnight ago, Sanjeev Verma, owner of Wild West, one of Chandigarh's oldest pubs, was told by a father that he wanted beer served at his son's school passing-out party. A manager of a bowling company in Mumbai concurs: ""We have the right to refuse but if a parent asks for a pitcher of beer and pours his teenage son a glassful we are helpless.""

Not all parents grant their children a drinking license. Yet when both parents work and attempt to compensate for their absence by doling out large sums of pocket money, it can be a dangerous indulgence.

It is a situation that is compounded by the easy availability of alcohol, says Vimla Nadkarni, professor at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai. Unlike most western countries where only the flash of a required ID is a passport to a drink, laws in India are loosely enforced.

Eighteen may be the legal age to ask for a beer but one round of the pubs in any city confirms that few bartenders have ever heard of it. And there are certainly no shortage of pubs. Six years ago, Chandigarh, a city of white beards, had just two pubs; today there are 26.

Excise Department rules also stipulate that a liquor outlet must not come up within 100 m of an educational institution or religious place, but it is a rule easily flouted. Governments see no sin in being casual, blinded as they may be by profits.

In Maharashtra, the excise income from sales of beer, IMFL, and wine in 1997-98 was Rs 774.79 crore; in 1998-99 it is expected to be Rs 1,023.23 crore.

Naturally, teenage alcoholism is also on the rise. According to studies done by the De-Addiction Centre at AIIMS in Delhi, every fifth teenager in the 15-19 age group in the capital drinks regularly and around three lakh are addicted.

Another one lakh, it is estimated, need medical attention for alcohol-related disorders. Says H.K. Sharma, a social scientist who was associated with the studies: ""Any party or get-together is incomplete without corks popping open. It's a whirlpool into which children get sucked so easily.""

To alter established mind-sets, to convince a generation that the buzz that comes with a beer has dangerous implications, requires a mammoth effort.

Counsellors stress that parents must start communicating with their children, identify reasons for their stress and not turn away with a grin when junior steals a peg of whisky from daddy's cabinet. In fact, some Mumbai colleges have already put up posters that read, ""Drinking with Dad is also Bad"".

The most basic of all prevention is enforcing the ban on sale to those under 18. The harder it is for kids to find a drink the better it is. As Y.G. Rajalakshmi Parthasarathy, dean of the Chennai's Padma Seshadri group of schools insists: ""Age certificates have to be made a must.""

Chennai Police say they conduct surprise raids in front of schools on Saturday nights when teenagers are prone to drink and drive, but it's not enough.

Also, a society that merely smirks at underage kids trying to find some machismo in a beer mug needs to understand there's nothing amusing in it. The journey from recreation to addiction, or to death in a Zen at 19, is not a long one.

- Bangalore, K.S. RAO

I am anguished by the immorality of means and the crude tactics adopted by the Rao Government to defeat the no-confidence motion sponsored by the combined opposition (""A Battered PM"", August 15). Never in the past had a government at the Centre stooped to ignoble means like using money and indulging in horse-trading to remain in power. While the Congress(I) has only served to further erode morality in public life, the moral authority of the Government to rule the country has been undermined.

- Hyderabad, S.B. Singh



The role played by Mulayam Singh Yadav in the survival of the Congress(I) Government cannot be easily dismissed. He nurtures dreams of becoming chief minister of Uttar Pradesh by riding on Narasimha Rao's shoulders. But are these weak shoulders capable of carrying him?

- Dehra Dun, Shailendra Seinger

Rao Is Irreplaceable

The opinion poll (""Three Way Split"", August 15) reveals two very interesting aspects of the public mood. They are: the emerging consensus on the Ram Mandir and Rao's lead in comparison to other prime ministerial hopefuls. Isn't it ironical that Rao still commands confidence in spite of the scandals besieging him? This only highlights the sad fact that there is an absolute lack of credible leaders in the country.

- Pune, Vijayan B.

Your electoral prediction does not take into account political parties other than the main three - Congress(I), BJP, National Front-Left Front combine. The smaller, regional parties play a crucial role in determining the result in a general election.

- Madras, C.T. Vairavan

The opinion poll only highlights how short public memory is and the ease with which politicians manipulate the minds of the people. This is reflected in the way political equations have undergone a complete change within a short span of six months. But the sad part is that we Indians are caught between the devil and the deep sea. Even if there is a mid-term poll, there isn't much to choose from.

- Indore, Ananth Srinivas

Your story based on the MARG poll seems to have been cooked up within the four walls of your office. If you think there is no BJP wave, all you need to do is hold a mid-term poll to find out the truth.The way the BJP has grown in the past few years is only because of the personality of L.K. Advani. I do not believe that he comes fourth in the race for prime minister. Next time you publish a so-called opinion poll, make sure that you present it in such a way that it does not look or sound so made-up.

- New Delhi, Asha Prabha

A surefire way to escape any kind of punishment for committing crimes in India is to become a politician.

Criminal Farce

This is a case of grotesque juxtaposition (""Gunning for Cover"", August 15). Men who are facing criminal charges are being protected by the state while it is society which needs protection from them. And the very same state is, on the other hand, fighting these men in the courts.

- Bhopal, Khalid Al Hasan

The Time Crunch

It is hard to believe that bereft of its Air Time Committee (ATC), Doordarshan was unable to evolve reasonable criteria for allotting time slots on its satellite channels (""Air Time Inanities"", August 15). If that was really the case, one is hard put to explain DD's success on its two channels. Besides, it will be grossly underestimating the Indian bureaucracy's sophistication to blame it on plain incompetence. The real reason perhaps was the time crunch.

Hyderabad, Dr Codadu Pratap

Still Smoky

One can't be certain even now whether the CBI will be able, or allowed, to produce clinching evidence linking Rajiv Gandhi with the Bofors pay-off (""The Smoke Clears, August 15). But it doesn't really matter. Anyone who believes that the late prime minister was not one of the beneficiaries must be naive or a fool. Or Mani Shankar Aiyar.

- Bangalore, K.R. Narayanaswamy

With the politicians busy nurturing their, can anyone stop Delhi from turning into a Transylvanian City ofConcrete?

Let Reason Reign

Your story on the rationalist movement (""The Triumph of Reason"", August 15) was refreshing. People need to emerge from the shadows of astrology and superstition. They need to discover that success depends on the work of their hands and not on the lines on their palms. On the other hand, it is necessary to realise that science too is not infallible. When I was at school we were taught that neutrons were the smallest particles. Now we have discovered neutrinos and quarks.

- Kanpur, Chhotebhai

Big Busybody

By forcing Russia to backtrack on its deal with India to supply cryogenic rocket technology (""Misguided Muscle"", August 15), Uncle Sam has clearly proved that in addition to its many faults, it is also the biggest busybody in the world. By his abject surrender to US blackmail, Boris Yeltsin has damaged his own stature and credibility. I'm certain the Russian President would even roll over and play dead if his American masters asked him to.

- New Delhi, Samir Mahajan

The US has once again established its credentials as a 'world policeman' by forcing Russia to break its agreement with India. Obviously the US is concerned about our success in space technology and wants to protect its own multimillion-dollar arms market. The Government must provide adequate funds, necessary facilities and moral support to our technocrats and scientists to undertake a space research programme to devise an indigenous substitute for the cryogenic engine technology.

- Solan, Pramod Sharma

Why do the Americans call their foreign minister Secretary of State? Judging by their meddling, it's possible that they consider all countries in the world to be their own states.

Cleaning the Capital

The most important thing is to control the menace of air pollution (""Capital Punishment"", August 15). The main culprit is the ever increasing number of vehicles on the road. It is, therefore, imperative that air pollution control legislation be strictly implemented immediately. The authorities should be equipped with modern gadgets to check the levels of emission and must be empowered to file cases against the defaulters. Above all, the courts should decide cases promptly in order to deter offenders.

- New Delhi, K.K. Bajaj

The problems of Delhi, so professionally summed up by you, are really well known. What is lacking is any long-term plan to tackle them with sincerity and determination. The greatest need at the moment is to set up an efficient transport system by implementing the Metropolitan Rapid Transport System through public and private funding. A few zones in the city could be declared out of bounds for private vehicles. Pedestrian plazas will cut down traffic snarls in the congested areas. If none of these plans work and things continue to deteriorate, we could shift the capital elsewhere and hope that history does not repeat itself.

- Bangalore, D.B.N. Murthy

In a typically Indian way we will all complain about our suffering, vehemently discuss Delhi's problems till we tire ourselves and then continue life as before. Nobody will take the initiative and take the necessary decisions. Ideas and proposals will be written down and then be lost in the bureaucratic jungle.

- New Delhi, Thomas And Nancy Niggli

Stress on Quantity

Your special survey on housing (""Building on Shortages"", August 15) was enlightening and relevant. However, you have not stressed the necessity of building large-scale low-cost housing. For most people interested in just finding a roof over their heads, fancy flats and bungalows are out of reach. There must be emphasis on the construction of inexpensive dwellings and importance should be given to utility and comfort rather than merely style and decor.

- Panchkula, Haryana, Alok Gupta

Denigrating Ourselves

Your tribute to A.K. Ramanujan (""Without Obituary"", August 15) cites the MacArthur prize as ""the highest critical accolade in the US"", while the Sahitya Akademi is called ""puny"". The former, established by an insurance tycoon, is nothing more than a monetary award given to dozens every year - well known and obscure, accomplished and potentially outstanding - merely to relieve them of the need to chase money. Do we still need to drool over any little recognition abroad while denigrating our own institutions?

- Madras, S. Ashok

Miraculous Mata

Let us not make any generalisations about godmen. There are things which supersede and triumph over logic and these are also worth contemplating.

The sarcasm and tone of your story on Mata Amritanandamayi, is intolerable (""The Gurus For the '90s"". July 31). My wife and I were deemed by doctors to be infertile but we were blessed with a child only by her divine grace and love. Amma's children shed tears of joy and relief lying in her lap. We offer these tears to our Mata. What qualification, what spiritual authority do you possess to write about one who is the divine mother of the universe?

- Madras, T.N. Krishnachandran



Mata Amritanandamayi, who you have written so harshly about, is the ambrosia that saved my husband's life and restored our domestic harmony. He was an alcoholic and smoking for over a decade. Then, just one confession to the Mata brought about a transformation which neither the Alcoholics Anonymous nor a clinical psychologist was able to bring about. I will be eternally grateful to her.

- Madras, Vinaya Govindam

A Question of Trust

Lt-General A.S. Bhullar, director-general, Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), is right in saying in his letter that the BIS is the first organisation to issue quality system certificates. But Indian Register Quality Systems (IRQS), a department of Indian Register of Shipping, is the first duly accredited Indian organisation for certification of quality systems (""Certified Fit"", Trade Winds, May 31).

The certification system of the BIS has not been independently verified as meeting internationally accepted criteria for certification bodies, unlike IRQS which has been accredited by Raad voor de Certificatie of the Netherlands. Consequently, the BIS certificate may not be easily accepted by importers abroad. This is not to say that the BIS system is inferior. What is urgently needed is a national accreditation system and organisation - like the UK's National Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies - as recommended by the EC experts' group.

Indian Army: Charges of incompetence among senior officers undermined the Eastern Command,"Charges of incompetence among senior officers have undermined the Eastern Command. - Issue Date: Apr 15, 1993",Kanwar sandhu,1993-04-15 00:00:00,"An alarming chain of events that unfolded last month has caused considerable embarrassment and convulsions in the higher command levels of the army.

Top level courts of inquiry have opened up a Pandora's box, involving misuse of funds and command failure in the sensitive Eastern Command that plays a strategic role in defending the border against China and in containing insurgency in the North-east.



Key professional reputations have been tarnished. The services of a Lt General, N.P.S. Bal, have been terminated. Two major-generals and several officers face inquiries. One brigadier has been dismissed from service and two others face trial.

The details have been pieced together by india today with access to reports of courts of inquiry and high-level official correspondence.



The disturbing story began soon after Major-General Vinod Saighal, an armoured corps officer and former military attache to France, took over command of 27 Mountain Division on March 17,1991. Differences arose with Lt General Bal, then GOC of 33 Corps, a Param Vishisht Seva Medal recipient with considerable combat experience.

Bal's career had a brush with controversy in 1984 when he was accused of being 'soft' towards Sikh army deserters. He was later exonerated. Within 17 days of taking over, Saighal sent a signal to HQ 33 Corps expressing reservations about the ""strategies for the '90s and proposed redeployment and dual tasking of formations"".

The plan called for thinning out the army in the Himalayas in view of the receding threat from China. To Bal's chagrin, Saighal sent a copy of his dissenting note to the Command HQ in Calcutta. Bal asked him not to bypass the Corps HQ. Saighal ignored this: ""The national interest requires that those directly charged with preserving the sanctity of the country's frontiers communicate their misgivings to their military superiors.""

""The termination of Bal's services was unprecedented and came as a great shock to me."" LT General (RETD) K.S. Brar

Former GOC-in-C, Eastern Command

Finally, Lt General K.S. Brar, then GOC-IN-C, Eastern Command, had to warn Saighal: ""I've found in you a consistent tendency to question orders..in an effort to project yourself as an 'independent thinker'."" The strategy was nonetheless implemented.



Differences between Saighal and Bal surfaced again when Major Rajiv Khanduri, posted in HQ 27 Mountain Division, died from gunshot injuries in mysterious circumstances on May 25, 1991. An inquiry ruled out foul play. But Saighal was not satisfied.

He appointed an 'evaluation committee' which recommended a CBI inquiry. Saighal wrote to the Army HQ, alleging foul play and referred to rumours about an alleged extra-marital affair involving a senior officer. But Bal and Brar decided to go by the inquiry report. Saighal was again reprimanded for overstepping himself.



From then on, it was an undeclared war between Saighal and Bal. One instance was the inquiry into the canteen of HQ 123 Mountain Brigade, commanded by Brigadier G.S. Kahlon. Saighal alleged that Kahlon had been provided 'immunity' by his predecessor, Major-General Kulwant Singh, and Bal. But Bal maintained that Saighal was blowing the whole thing out of proportion.



As the top commanders locked horns, several other units of 27 Mountain Division got into trouble. According to inquiries, an engineers' regiment was alleged to have misappropriated operational funds; a battalion of the Bihar Regiment (2 Bihar) was accused of selling coal dust illegally; and a battalion of the Garhwal Rifles (19 Garhwal) was allegedly running an unauthorised soda water factory. Allegations surfaced against the ordnance unit of the division and the ordnance set-up in HQ 33 Corps.



Meanwhile, there was a dispute between Saighal and Bal over an adverse evaluation given by Saighal to Brigadier M.P.S. Kondal, commander, 166 Mountain Brigade. Instead of accepting Saighal's dim view of his brigadier, Bal decided to organise an exercise in October 1991 to test Kondal's proficiency.

Saighal complained that Bal was interfering in his command. But Bal maintained that he chose to test Kondal personally to ensure that he was not being treated unfairly.



The shenanigans continued. A battalion of the Sikh Regiment (19 Sikh) - a part of 27 Mountain Division-became the centre of controversy when two of its officers were roughed up by jawans. Bal ordered another officer, an alcoholic, to be hospitalised and had the commandant replaced.

Saighal complained against Bal's interference. But Bal's response was: since Saighal never visited the unit, he, as the regiment's ceremonial colonel-commandant had to ensure things did not get out of hand.



The constant skirmishes were bound to escalate into a full-blown battle and the involvement of the Army HQ and Defence Ministry was inevitable. Saighal wrote several letters to the ministry.

One contained insinuations of a ""communal nexus"" between various senior officers in the Command, others spoke of the presence of 'anti-national elements' in the Corps. Some of the communications were anonymous.

That led to the Military Secretary's branch at Army HQ scrutinising the annual confidential reports initiated by the concerned officers. In an unusual move, the Army HQ appointed a court of inquiry in October 1991 headed by the then vice-chief of army staff, Lt General V.K. Sood.

Eventually, Bal was removed from the command of 33 Corps and appointed director-general, Rashtriya Rifles, at New Delhi. Saighal too was removed and appointed deputy commandant, College of Combat, Mhow.



Sood is reported to have expressed dismay at the state of affairs in 33 Corps. Following this, Kulwant Singh was removed from a pivotal appointment in the HQ Western Command and posted as deputy commandant, Infantry School, Belgaum.

He was issued a show cause notice for the award of the army chiefs 'displeasure', and action is yet to be taken.



But that was not the end of the story. The sorry saga, in fact, took a strange twist. Saighal, the cause of much of the controversy, suddenly saw a change in his professional fortunes. He was given command of 24 Rapid Division in the Western Sector, a more sensitive command than his earlier command of the Mountain Division.

His rehabilitation is still steeped in mystery and is viewed by many officers of the Eastern Command as being another example of the imbalance and inconsistency in decisions taken by the Defence Ministry. However, Army HQ sources said Saighal was given a 'second command' in view of his representation against the adverse report filed against him.



The unusual turnaround in Saighal's case is more surprising considering the action taken against others. On the basis of separate inquiries, several other officers are to face court martial. Kahlon has been sentenced to dismissal.

Eight officers of 123 Mountain Brigade are facing action. And the 33 Corps deputy director of ordnance, a brigadier, who has since retired, continues to be 'attached' for court martial proceedings.



Bal, meanwhile, was given a show cause notice last October on the basis of Sood's inquiry, for award of 'severe displeasure' of the army chief on four counts. The charges included misuse of manpower and army transport, failing to report property returns satisfactorily, failing to accommodate views different from his own, interference in the command of subordinates and exhibiting lack of firmness in dealing with Saighal.

But then, instead of inviting the army chief s displeasure, Bal was dismissed by the Government on January 25 under Section 18 of the Army Act, 1950, and his decorations withdrawn.

""The termination of Bal's services in this manner was not only unprecedented but came as a great shock to me,"" said Brar, adding that while Saighal's conduct was unbecoming of an officer, he had no complaints against Bal.

Regretting that the action against Bal and the rehabilitation of Saighal were done within days of his retirement on October 1, 1992 as GOC-IN-C, Eastern Command, Brar observed: ""What value is an army commander if his views are to be undermined.""



Sood is unwilling to talk: ""I completed the inquiry in November 1991 and retired in February 1992. The action against Bal may be related to something that happened after that.""



Full details of the episode may never be known. But it raises many disturbing questions about key areas of the army's functioning. Ego clashes and disagreements are nothing new among senior officers in professional armies.

But the way these undermined the Eastern Command and the fact that charges and countercharges of incompetence and even a communal nexus were allowed to be tossed around as if it were routine bureaucratic warfare in a government department, is extremely disturbing.

While refusing to comment on the episode, the Army HQ says steps have been taken to prevent a recurrence. But judging by the curious twists and turns in the recent happenings in the crucial Eastern Command, that is unlikely to be taken seriously by the officers whose careers depend on the whims of the military bureaucracy.","['indian', 'bal', 'army', 'command', 'officers', 'charges', 'saighal', 'mountain', 'corps', 'hq', 'eastern', 'incompetence', 'inquiry', 'undermined', 'senior']","To Bal's chagrin, Saighal sent a copy of his dissenting note to the Command HQ in Calcutta.

WOMEN AT WORK: Confident participants at a district Sanchayika Sangh meeting WOMEN AT WORK: Confident participants at a district Sanchayika Sangh meeting

Some miracles are self-made. Stranded deep in Orissa's backwoods, Tapaswini Dhal's life was a bleak one and there was little hope of her seeing light in the years to come. With no electricity, her thatched home in Mayurbhanj descended into darkness every night and her husband's meagre earnings meant that her four children went hungry most of the time.Till the day she heard of women's self-help groups in the state and decided to join. Soon after, Dhal was able to set up a small rope-making unit. Over the months, the common fund to which she subscribed along with other women grew big enough for her to apply for a loan. The amount she wanted wasn't huge but it was sufficient for her to pay for a power connection at home. ""We haven't become rich,"" says Dhal. ""But the future looks brighter now.""Like Dhal, there are many other women leading anonymous lives in the remote regions of Orissa who are now daring to dream. Individually helpless, they have found strength in numbers by joining the self-help groups being set up under Mission Shakti, a statewide campaign launched last year by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik.The object of Mission Shakti is to facilitate the empowerment of women. ""It is as if a silent revolution is on,"" says Anu Garg of the state Government's Social Welfare Department, who heads the mission.Garg should know best. Her phones ring constantly with officials at ground zero reporting heartening stories: a self-help group in Odapada of Dhenkanal pooled in money to get an orphan girl married, in Khurda a group of women overpowered a suspected rapist who had managed to give the police the slip, in Chatrapur crooked contractors found themselves laid off as women took to laying roads, in Koraput, alcoholic husbands had been served ultimatums, and so the stories grow.Although a full-fledged campaign to form self-groups began only last year, the idea is not entirely new. Years ago in a unique experiment, an innovative district collector at Ganjam, Santosh Satpathy, encouraged women in his district to save money. The women were initially reluctant because few realised the value of savings.But with constant prodding, Satpathy managed to build a common pool, even accommodating women who could spare only Re 1 a day. Thus began a movement. As the groups grew in size and number, the kitty too grew fatter. By the last count, there were over 8,000 groups in Ganjam with over one lakh members who could boast of a total savings of around Rs 5 crore.Soon women began setting up their own businesses, such as brick kilns and units collecting and processing forest products. Some borrowed from the kitty while others approached banks for loans. With savings becoming a habit, loan defaults were a rarity and the size of the common fund remained healthy. The women discovered a new side to themselves. ""They were able to get back their voices,"" says Sanjeev Mishra, the current collector of Ganjam.Tales of the Ganjam women's success soon travelled to the neighbouring districts. The women of Atotapalli in Chatrapur too organised themselves into a group and set up a brick kiln. As profits trickled in, they began calling the shots. They recall how they stopped one of their husbands from going in for a second marriage. They even roped in the police to teach the man a lesson.Impressed by the developments in Ganjam and Chatrapur, Patnaik decided to give the self-help programmes an official boost. To make matters easier, Satpathy was now serving in the chief minister's secretariat itself. Using Satpathy's expertise, Patnaik soon kicked off Mission Shakti.Unlike states like Tamil Nadu where the Government spends around Rs 200 crore a year on similar self-help groups, the Orissa Government only helps build up credit linkages of the groups with the banks. The banks are only too willing to lend. ""With defaults as little as 2 per cent, our money is safe,"" explains Prasanna Kumar Behera of the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development.While women in Orissa have unarguably benefited from the programme, there have been gains for local politicians too. It was just as well for the chief minister that his assembly constituency was in Ganjam district. The scheme can only have widened his support base.By focusing on the formation of one lakh self-help groups, he has ensured the rock-solid backing of two million women in the state. ""The issue is not about reaping political dividends,"" insists Dharmendra Pradhan, a BJP MLA. ""It is about improving lives and empowering women."" Whatever the political motivation behind the scheme, the statewide campaign is bringing about unprecedented synergy among the women.In the one year that Mission Shakti has been at work, at least 29,000 additional self-help groups have sprung up over the state, from Nayagarh in coastal Orissa to Nowrangpur and Koraput districts deep in the tribal interiors. What's more, the women in these groups have managed to save Rs 6 crore so far, a fund from which they freely borrow and just as easily replenish.Rita Roy, a sociologist with the Bhubaneswar-based Utkal University, says Orissa's women are finally beginning to forge an identity of their own. It's true in more ways than one. For years, the women of Panijia were little more than voiceless entities. But ever since they grouped themselves into the Bana Durga Sayang Sanchayaka Sangh-the groups are generally named after reigning deities-the men ""comply with what we say"", smiles Rukmini Deo, one of the region's pioneer women.Although illiterate, Deo and other sangh members were clear that their children should be educated. So they went about planning a school in the village. While they provided the money for the structure, their men agreed to put it up free of cost. The school building at the centre of the village is a veritable landmark now. It not only stands as a tribute to the efforts of the women, but also holds the promise of a secure future for their children.It's a heartening example for other women so far trapped in poverty and illiteracy, unable to rise out of it or dream of a better future for their children. With their rope units and brick kilns, these women are building the road to hope in Orissa.","['brick', 'schemes', 'forge', 'women', 'credit', 'determination', 'ganjam', 'district', 'village', 'state', 'future', 'selfhelp', 'money', 'orissa', 'groups', 'identity', 'micro']","The amount she wanted wasn't huge but it was sufficient for her to pay for a power connection at home.

"Aaj ka sawaal: While PM Modi is in Israel, where is Mr Kejriwal?","AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal, who used to take on PM Modi and the BJP on most issues of national significance until recently, has been conspicuous by his absence of late.",Kumar Shakti Shekhar,2017-07-05 00:00:00,"Amidst the hectic political activities happening in the country and abroad, one person missing from action is Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener, who usually comments on all the crucial national issues and attacks Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the ruling BJP, of late is conspicuous by his absence.

These days Kejriwal is not seen even on television channels giving sound bytes. Advertisements featuring him on TVs and radio channels have also done a vanishing act.

At least three significant developments have taken place in the last one month. The presidential and vice presidential elections have been announced, historic economic reform in the form of Goods and Services Tax (GST) has been implemented and Narendra Modi became the first prime minister in about 70 years of India's independence to embark upon a three-day visit to Israel.

But the Delhi CM appears to be aloof from all these developments. His comments on mainstream and social media are hard to find. Otherwise, Kejriwal used to be at the forefront in criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his government and BJP on most of the issues.

KEJRIWAL HAS NO LOCUS STANDI ON ISRAEL ISSUE: SOURCES

Reacting on these three recent developments, sources close to Kejriwal told India Today that the Delhi CM does not have any locus standi on the Israel issue. Reminded that other opposition leaders were giving their opinion on it, they were of the view that Kejriwal had not been forthcoming on foreign matters.

On GST, they said Kejriwal had taken part in a hangout on July 2 over the issue and also the alleged lynching over beef of Junaid a day before Eid. They said he had also ""retweeted"" some comments. On the presidential elections, they said the party had hinted that they would not support the candidature of BJP's candidate Ram Nath Kovind.

However, in the past, the Delhi CM used to take an unequivocal stand on issues and would aggressively put forth his point of view.

When the whole nation was celebrating over India launching surgical strikes against terrorists on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on September 29, 2016, Kejriwal was among the few opposition leaders who had doubted the military exercise. The Delhi CM had demanded that the Centre provide proofs of the surgical strikes. While doing so, he faced criticism in the country but was quoted extensively in Pakistan.

KEJRIWAL CRITICAL OF DEMONETISATION

Similarly, when PM Modi announced the demonetisation initiative at 8 pm on November 8, 2016, most of the people went euphoric. The move was hailed by most sections of society. But Kejriwal along with his West Bengal counterpart Mamata Banerjee led a campaign to demand a rollback of demonetisation. He even threatened PM Modi of ""revolt"" from the masses if 'notebandi' was not withdrawn.

But not any longer. Kejriwal has refrained from appearing on the national scene regarding any significant matter. He has confined himself to the national capital, attending to local issues.

CM @ArvindKejriwal listening to the grievances of residents of Valmiki colony and assures action on the complaints. pic.twitter.com/PSxpGYiERl - AAP (@AamAadmiParty) July 2, 2017

He has hardly been even posting original tweets. On almost all occasions, he is found retweeting posts. Interestingly, a large number of his retweets belong to an anonymous person called AAP Ka Mehta with the Twitter handle @DaaruBaazMehta. Translated into English, the handle means 'alcoholic Mehta'.

Sample a couple of such retweets:

One would wonder why a politician like Kejriwal has suddenly started maintaining a low profile. These could be the seven reasons behind the Delhi CM taking a backseat:

1. DEFEAT IN ASSEMBLY POLLS

Kejriwal was almost sure of winning the Assembly elections in Punjab and Goa held earlier this year. The drubbing in Punjab and the failure to open any account in Goa was embarrassing for the Delhi CM. His prestige was at stake in both these states because of the time and resources invested there. But a loss in both these states in his very attempt to expand AAP's base beyond the national capital proved a damp squib.

2. LOSS IN MCD ELECTIONS

It was AAP's first election for controlling the three bodies of Municipal Corporation of Delhi. However, the party ruling in Delhi lost to BJP. This was no less a jolt than the defeat in Punjab and Goa Assembly elections because AAP is the ruling party here.

3. EMBARRASSMENT OVER EVM

After the defeat in the two Assembly elections, Kejriwal alleged that the EVMs were tampered with to defeat AAP. He alleged that the EVMs were rigged to favour BJP in Uttar Pradesh and Goa and Congress in Punjab. He accused the Election Commission (EC) of playing into the hands of the Centre. He demanded that the EC hand over one EVM to AAP for 72 hours and it would prove that the software could be tampered with.

EC accepted the challenge and invited not just AAP but all political parties to try their luck in proving that EVMs could be rigged. However, the parties, including AAP, backed out. This was again a loss of face for Kejriwal.

4. INTERNAL WRANGLINGS

AAP has been beset with internal strife, particularly after the electoral defeats. Former Delhi minister Kapil Mishra has revolted against Kejriwal, levelling serious allegations of financial irregularities and improprieties against his chief minister.

Around the same time, AAP co-founder and Kejriwal's confidante Kumar Vishwas have fallen apart. The two were seen trying to harm each other's political interests. A truce was sought to be brought about but it does not seem to be a permanent one. These have bogged Kejriwal down.

5. DEFAMATION CASES

The defamation cases filed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley against Kejriwal and four others from AAP have weighed him down. Though the AAP convener is fighting the case and has appointed senior lawyer Ram Jethmalani to defend him, he appears to be on the defensive. Kejriwal has been seen trying to wriggle out of the case by prolonging it and buying time.

6. OFFICE OF PROFIT CASE

Besides the revolt by three AAP MLAs, the sword of disqualification is also dangling over 20 of the 66 party legislators over the office of profit case. EC has ruled that it would continue hearing in the office of profit case. It has also signalled disqualification of the 20 MLAs. The final decision may come soon. If that happens, it would be the severest jolt that Delhi's AAP government would receive so far.

The judgment may also rob AAP of the moral authority to rule Delhi. Kejriwal may be forced to resign and call for mid-term election.

7. ED, CBI CASES

Central investigative agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) are examining cases lodged against AAP leaders including Kejriwal and his ministerial colleague Satyender Jain. ED has filed a case against AAP for allegedly diverting Rs 2 crore donations. A case is also pending over financing of ""secret spy squad"".

BACK TO DELHI

Kejriwal has apologised to the people of Delhi on two counts - for resigning in 2014 in a huff after 49 days of rule and for contesting the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from a large number of seats in several states. While swearing in as CM during his second term on February 14, 2015, he had promised not to leave Delhi.

However, he forgot his promise and did the opposite by trying to expand AAP's base to Punjab and Goa. While the party lost elections in both the states, Kejriwal lost face and Delhi lost administration and governance. While he and his party leaders were busy campaigning outside Delhi, Delhi was plagued with vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue and chikungunya.

Kejriwal seems to have realised his folly. And it's back to basics now for him.

"When in Mumbai, these are the 12 things one HAS to do","As Simply Mumbai celebrates its 12th anniversary, we look at the most interesting experiences the city has to offer. - Issue Date: Oct 31, 2016",Moeena Halim,2016-10-31 00:00:00,"When Gregory David Roberts first attempts to paint a picture of Mumbai in Shantaram, he evokes the readers' olfactory senses to describe the city. ""I could smell it before I saw or heard anything of India. It's the smell of gods, demons, empires, and civilizations in resurrection and decay. It's the blue skin-smell of the sea, no matter where you are in the Island City, and the blood-metal smell of machines.

It smells of the stir and sleep and waste of sixty million animals more than half of them humans and rats,"" says Roberts' protagonist Lin. In those few lines, Roberts describes so much that makes up Mumbai. And it's not pretty. But beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder and Mumbai can be gorgeous to those who look closely enough. For Mahim-based author Jerry Pinto, the city's beauty is best experienced in the monsoon. ""Walking on Marine Drive in the rains. It's almost dangerous because the waves are angry and can even cross the road,"" he says of his favourite city experience.

Whether it is enjoyed during a walk by the promenades, the beaches, a breezy drive by Worli Sea Link or from up in the air, the sea is indeed Mumbai's saving grace. But as Suketu Mehta notes in Maximum City, ""There are many Bombays."" And while the New York-based author returned to the city to find his Bombay, we at Simply Mumbai celebrate our 12th anniversary in search of ours through some of the most interesting experiences the city has to offer.

Here are 12 of our favourites.

1) Spot art in the most unlikely places

Street art is not difficult to spot in Mumbai city, especially if you're a regular to Bandra and its several quaint little villages. Colourful, quirky, comical, some political and others blatantly Bollywood works of art adorn the walls surrounding the Portuguesestyle bungalows and old shops and bakeries in the area. Also, keep your eyes peeled for Mumbai's most well known anonymous artist Tyler's snarky graffiti and the giant tribute to Dadasaheb Phalke on Bandra's MTNL building.

In Juhu, you'd be hard-pressed to dodge the art-full trees. Raasta Chaap's group of ladies has been dedicatedly painting dead rain trees to draw attention to the menace, leaving residents with brighter pavements. Thanks to the Snehal Patil-led Bombay Drawing Room, Santacruz station now has a tribute to Vincent Van Gogh as well as Monet. And if you're at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus this month, you're likely to experience a public art festival with artists including Owais Husain showcasing their work.

2) Escape to a green hiding place

Mumbai is a crowded city, and we don't need numbers to prove it. Greenery is hard to find and quiet even more so. Unless you know exactly where to look or you know someone in the know. Author Jerry Pinto suggests early mornings at Sanjay Gandhi National Park. ""There are more butterfly species here, I am told, than in the whole of the UK,"" he says. But the national park in Borivali is a prime picnic spot in a city starved of space.

For a truly secret location, you'd be better off trusting Blue Bulb's Regan Rodricks or Nelson Fernandes, who will arrange for complete isolation in the midst of a forest-all within city limits. Rodrick's favourite hideaway in Nala Sopara is a 25-minute hike which brings you to a waterfall and a lake where you can go kayaking. If you'd rather skip the trek, he'll show you the way to Shirgaon, a Virar wonder which has a lake but no falls. ""The secret location was discovered during a flight by a paragliding instructor, who doubles as a guide,"" reveals Rodricks. Contact bluebulb.in

3) Take in the aerial view of the city

Mumbai looks magical from the skies. A helicopter ride is a great way to enjoy the views-the shimmering seas, the legoland skyscrapers, and the dazzling lights. Aman Aviation claims to be the first to have started the helicopter services about three years ago. They tied up with the IRCTC and operate from the Juhu aerodrome, offering rides of different durations for differing budgets. ""A fifteen minute ride will take you over Juhu, Bandra, Worli Sea Link and Dadar. Five minutes more and you can see the Queens Necklace over Marine Drive,"" reveals Mahesh Purushothaman, Aman Aviation.

A ride over Colaba and the eastern side takes about 30 minutes. If you've got the budget for it, this is the one you should be doing so you don't miss the very tip of the city. ""The helicopters are three seaters, but most of our rides are taken by couples,"" reveals Purushothaman. No doubt, a number of marriage proposals happen up in the air. If you do go in for a 30-minute ride, carry along a picnic basket. Price Rs 9,900 onwards Contact helicoptertoursmumbai.in (for helicopter ride)

4) Walk among history

You'd be forgiven if you said Mumbai pales in comparison to Delhi when it comes to the richness of its history. But to be fair, the city does have a rather intriguing past too. From the original Mumbaikars-the Kolis, to the Portuguese and then the British Raj, each community has left an enduring impact on the city. The stories can be found in the bylanes of Bandra and Byculla as well as the colonial buildings of South Mumbai. ""I think that every neighbourhood has its own unique story to share, which fit into and help illustrate the wider story or histories of Mumbai.

The erstwhile Fort area, Colaba, the area north of Crawford Market, Bandra, Byculla, would be only some of my favourite parts of the city to explore,"" says Alisha Sadikot, who organises heritage walks across the city through The Inheritage Project. If you'd like to know more about the living, thriving city, a great way to do it is to meet Harshvardhan Tanwar at dawn. The founder of No Footprints shows you how the city can be teeming with activity even as early as 5 a.m., taking you to Parel, Sassoon Docks, Crawford and Dadar markets. Contacts theinheritageproject.wordpress. com; facebook.com/nofootprintsmumbai

5) Sail into the open seas

The monsoon is gone and the October heat has set in. This also means that the seas are open to the public once again. Yacht, sailboat, ferry-from luxury experiences to a choppy adventure-pick your preference.""Sailing is always a crowd-pleaser,"" claims Regan Rodricks, Blue Bulb, which organises two hour experiences that cost Rs 4000 for four people. This is an experience that wasn't available to the public until a few years ago.

""I'd say grab the opportunity quickly before the government changes the rules again,"" he laughs. If you're looking for something a bit more exclusive, try The Happywala Weekend, which promises to host you on a yacht at a secret location or plan your own party with Gateway Charters, which rents out luxury motor yachts, speedboats or sailboats. Contacts gatewaycharters.in/; facebook. com/The-Happywala-Weekend

6) Join the midnight cyclists

Mumbai might not have dedicated cycle tracks, but it certainly does have an extremely active cycling community. A monsoon ride, an Independence Day ride, a long ride to Lonavala, a short ride down Carter Road-you'll find a cycling group for every mood. If you're comfortable on a two-wheel ride, a night ride would be the best way to enjoy the city. While some of these are paid events, most are open to all and encourage a sense of community. Avid cyclist and author Rakesh Bakshi enjoys getting riders together to appreciate the city's heritage structures by night. Sunil Gandhi organises night rides to hit the city's after-hours restaurants, while Bichanix's Zubair Lodi organises fun rides.

""Those who don't have their own, can rent cycles from us at Rs 70 per hour. We usually go for two or three hours to explore the city by night,"" says Lodi. The group always stops for a bite at the city's favourite food spots Haji Ali Juice Centre, Bachelorss and the likes. For those who don't mind pitching in for a ride, Some Place Else's The Mightnight Trail is also a good option. They allow you to rent a cycle for Rs 975 and usually ride from Bandra to Worli and back. Contacts facebook.com/Bichanix; facebook.com/SomePlaceElseIndia

7) Experience magnificence at the Royal Opera House

For 25 years now, the Royal Opera House has been deprived of its former glory. Thanks to restoration architect Abha Narain Lamba, under the patronage of the royal Gondal family, the country's last remaining opera house is going to open its doors not just to the finest performances from across the globe, but also to dialogue, debate, and discourse. ""The Royal Opera House in this new avatar is our gift to the city of Mumbai,"" says Gondal Maharaja Jyotendra Sinhji Jadeja.

On October 20, the Opera House reopens with the inauguration of the 18th Jio Mami Film Festival. ""The very next night, we have an operatic performance paying homage to its heritage,"" reveals Asad Laljee, in-charge of programming. Thrilled that the ""cultural jewel"" of Bombay is back, Laljee reveals that he is hoping to get children to visit the space too. ""It would be a great way for them to learn about our heritage and its restoration,"" he says. After the private events in October, the opera house will take a bit of a breather and open to the public in November. Contact Royal Opera House, Charni Road

8) Be part of the country'sbest wine club

When you've got the country's only Master of Wine in the city, why would you go to anyone else to find you the best vino in the world? Launched late last month, Sonal Holland's Soho Wine Club is a membership-based club for the city's wine lovers. Appalled at how few wines are accessible in the markets in Mumbai, Holland uses her expertise to curate the best wines from across the globe.""Soho is devoted to wine lovers who want to be part of a community. People always ask me what to drink, where to buy it; this was always a dream for me,"" says Holland. As part of the club, members receive regular reading materials on wine. ""But to really know wine, you must taste as much as you can,"" she adds. And so Holland plans to organise as many events in the city as possible. Contact sohowineclub.in/

9) Sniff out a secret music session

Secret Roof/ Secret Sessions is a closed Facebook group; its 865 members are the only ones invited for the sessions musicians Aditya Jasiwal, Ankit Mansukhani, Abhishek Kukrety, Davind Handa and Chirayu Vedekar host on private rooftops across the city. ""Our sessions began as a way to give each other a platform, but we are now working hard at not attracting too much attention,"" admits Jaiswal.

Attempting to offer a range of music options, these secret sessions include electronic as well as live music. If the underground rap scene seems more enticing, you could look up Battle Bars Bombay, who organise themed battles. ""At the end of October we have three battles, all related to comic book themes such as Deadmau5 vs Mickey Mouse, Shaktimaan vs Superman, and so on,"" says Vineet Nair aka Poetik Justis, who is currently also working on building a Freestyle Fraternity. ""It'll be an all-freestyle rap-based concept where we go right off the dome. No practiced lyrics or nothing,"" he adds. Contacts facebook.com/groups/993255020753742/ (Secret Sessions); facebookcombattlebarsbombay

10) Say hello to the Flamingoes at Sewri

Birwatching in the city can be surprisingly satisfying. One might think that pigeons, crows, kites and the occasional sparrow crowd the skies, but keep your eyes open for birds of a different feather and you do find them. The Coppersmith Barbet, a tiny green bodied, red headed, whiskered bird, is Mumbai's official bird. It's shy, but extremely common and is often spotted around large peepal trees. But it's the pink flamingoes that begin their visit to the city every year around October or November and stay till March that bring the most excitement to bird lovers in the city. The Sewri mudflats become home for these birds for months and the Sewri jetty offers an expansive view of the flock. If you'd like to join a birdwatching session to learn a thing or two about the longlegged beauties, a tour with Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) are a great bet. Contact bnhs.org

11)Savour some of the finest meals in the mills

Mumbai before the 1980s' mill strike was a very different sight to see. Cotton mills had dotted central Mumbai then. The 1990s brought a surge of redevelopment, turning several mills into unsightly malls. Luckily, recent times have brought more tasteful, culturally inclined developments in the old industrial plots. So the G5A Foundation for Contemporary Culture finds a home at the Laxmi Mills Compound in Mahalaxmi and the Nine Fish Art Gallery comes to The New Great Eastern Mills compound in Byculla.

The various mills across the city have also become hubs for exciting restaurants and restobars. Kamala Mills is home to Bombay Canteen, which serves some of the most exciting food in the city. Laxmi Mills has Masque, the city's first restaurant to have a rotating set menu that depends solely on the produce available to Chef Prateek Sadhu and his team. Magazine Street Kitchen, in the industrial Devidayal Estate in Reay Road, is another experimental space to keep track of for foodies in the city. Contact 022-2499 1010 (Masque); facebook.com/MagStreetKitchen

12) Find a friendly neighbourhood performance space

The NCPA in Nariman Point has for decades been the city's premier performance space, and continues to be because of its exciting productions (this year there's Mughal-e-Azam and Reth) and fantastically curated performances. ""But more recently there's been a trend of smaller performance spaces, which are providing opportunities to a lot more performers. Apart from The Cuckoo Club in Bandra, CLAP in Malad, there are so many pubs that are open to performers,"" notes Deepa Gahlot, Head - Programming (Theatre & Film). Bandra also has NSPA's QTube Cafe, while South Mumbai's Ballard Estate has Yiamas, an experimental space that ""gives you the opportunity to weave stories to complement your memories.""

Last month saw an exciting range of theatrical performances from YouTheatre including Bandar ki Baraat, The Storytellers and Alexander vs Chanakya. Besides these performance spaces, you might walk into a neighbourhood pub, brewery or caf and be pleasantly surprised with a comedy act or a play. If you drop in at AntiSOCIAL, in the basement of Khar Social-""a raw, un-programmed and un-regulated space for the social outliers""- you'll always be in for a surprise. Poetry readings, workshops, pow wows, art exhibitions, musical evenings, design showcases, screenings, and literary evenings-there's something for everyone.
