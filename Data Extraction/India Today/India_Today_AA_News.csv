(Representational Image)
A three-year-old girl was rescued by Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) in Delhi's Prem Nagar. The minor was found lying in a pool of excreta in her room. She was severely ill. She looked pale and her alcoholic father was asleep next to her.
The DCW rescued the minor after receiving an anonymous complaint that a minor girl in Prem Nagar area was not fed for the last three days by her father.
The DCW team found her father sleeping in the same room which was filled with empty liquor bottles. When they tried to wake him up, he got violent.
The DCW team then called the police and took the duo -- the father and child -- to the Prem Nagar police station. However, no FIR has been registered so far in the matter.
The neighbors informed DCW that the father, a rickshaw puller, was a drunkard and would not wake up for hours while his daughter wept due to hunger and the filth inside the room.
The child's mother died a year ago and the father was drunk all the time, the neighbours told the DCW team. He would leave the girl alone in the room whenever he went to work and did not allow his neighbours to help him.
The neighbours said they have seen the father put liquor in his daughter's milk bottle and force fed her.
The DCW team has admitted the minor to a nearby hospital where the doctors informed that the child's private parts are infected due to poor hygiene. She would be shifted to a shelter home once she is discharged from the hospital.
DCW's Kiran Negi and Vandana Singh have taken up the matter with the Delhi Commissioner of Police (DCP) and asked him why no FIR has been registered and the father not been arrested so far.
DCW chairperson Swati Maliwal expressed shock over the incident and urged the Delhi Police to take immediate action against the father.
""I applaud the man who called DCW's women helpline and helped us rescue this child who has undergone extreme trauma both in terms of the loss of her mother and an uncaring and alcoholic father,"" Swati Maliwal said.
""It's shocking that the child was given alcohol by her own father and has such extreme injury marks on her body. Alcoholism is the worst disease. Police should immediately take the strongest action against the father,"" Maliwal said."
1,How to survive -40 degree Celsius winter? Quora user reveals chilling details,[],2019-01-21 13:30:00,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201901/SIBERIACOLLAGE-647x363.jpeg?FrO6.n2jyQ9MDBvaq_sX8fBt6AagTUt2,"For people who live in the tropics, we have a majority of seasons to enjoy every year. The blossom of the leaves and flowers in spring, the heat wave in summers and the snowfall in winters, or the trees shedding leaves in autumn.
But for people higher up, near the poles, just mere survival can be a Herculean task. Hear it from the horse's mouth.
An anonymous Quora user has thrown light on the unimaginable lives of people living in extremely cold temperatures in places like Siberia, and it is chilling to say the least. Literally.
The user mentions spending a winter in a remote Siberian town where the temperatures remained below -20 degree Celsius throughout. On some days, the mercury further droped to -40 degree Celsius.
The hard-hitting insight into an average day of a person's life in this town will leave you in shock.
In a 14-point list, the user provides a pretty challenging picture of everyday survival in such extremely cold temperatures. The user writes about wearing layers over layers of clothing, learning the art of cleaning an animal carcass, collecting wood from the jungle to keep your home warm each day and takes readers through numerous other realities that are just too difficult to imagine from our cosy 20-degree-Celsius winters.
""If you can put in a thin shirt underneath your fur coats, you put it in,"" the user writes.
Eliminating the option of feasting on greens, the user declares that for most people, they can be unaffordable. Focusing on the importance of preserving and pickling veggies during the summer, the user writes, ""There are no veggies to eat. There are no fruits. Those who can afford them, are usually the oligarchs who come to visit their mansions for fun. Canada might have, because it has world’s largest food producer just next to it. Fatty meats, milks fats, milk, and some roots and tubers.""
The simple act of 'breathing' can be daunting in -20 degree Celsius. The user points out that due to 'dry air', every breath you breathe out will push water out of your body, thus making your lungs dry and causing 'breath burns'. Sounds scary, doesn't it?
The user writes, ""You might want to replenish the fluids in your body, even when you’re inside. Light alcohol, helps. Of course, then the legendary vodka. But once the alcohol effects are dimmed, you feel more cold. So you need to keep drinking.""
The user continues, ""In remote areas, nights can get dark. People will not have windows, and if anyone has, they will fill it up with winter covers, which basically means putting several wood boards. Nights are dark. Pitch black dark if you get even about 100 meters away from the civilisation. You can’t see your own hands or body. You need to have sufficient lighting. The more batteries the better.""
Diesel fuel run cars are completely missing from this town, according to the user. 'Gas' run automobiles are the prime alternative. The user explains, ""You should have gas generators, gas cars, gas everything. Diesel will gel up, diesel engines can’t start combustion, or there must be specially designed engines, which have spark plugs. You don’t shut off the car unless you get everything you need. You will sometimes need to heat up the car before starting it, because it just won’t start.""
The user's post makes you realise the importance of finding a hunt each day, among many things. Describing the scanty availability of food, the writer stresses on not wasting any edible part of an animal's body and consuming all that can be had. The user writes, ""You learn to kill and clean a carcass. Really. Deer, horse, and whatever animal you come across."" Talking about animal meat, the person says, ""You don’t waste any body parts. You will clean off the large intestine of all the poop and eat whatever part is edible. You eat the heart, brains, and even break up the bones sometimes for the marrow. Of a horse or a reindeer out of a 100kg carcass, 20kg is the highest amount that should go waste. The skins, are used. The most expert folks will be able to reduce the wastage to 16-18kg. The amazing thing is, eating up all the body parts, ensures that people are never ever deficient in any macro or micro nutrients.""
We hope that was not gory for you.
""Metal is no good. If the temperatures drop, the metal can become brittle. It doesn’t conserve heat. It conducts heat too well. Wood. Wood. Wood. Your body will stick to metal. Wood is the way to go. You can't burn metal. You can burn wood,"" the user explains.
Everything is valuable for survival in these temperatures, 'wood' being extremely important in these circumstances. The user writes, ""You don’t keep fuel in your home. Fuel means wood. Butane and propane are cute. But you don’t have enough to stock up for the entire winter. Once winter starts, you can’t get more either. You can always go into the forests and get more wood.""
Taking us further through the nerve-racking details, the user explains the hazards related to the simple act of 'sweating'. Comparing sweating to death, the user explains sweating resulting in a phenomenon called 'sweat ice', that can potentially prove fatal. ""You don’t want to sweat. So you don’t heat your home too much. You sweat, you die. You want to work hard, okay. BUT DO NOT SWEAT. SWEAT = DEATH. Sweat will go into your clothes. Water is a good conductor of heat, way better than air. You will get cold. If you sweat too much, your clothes will freeze and stick to your skin. The sweat ice will kill you in a few hours. If you sweat, wipe it off, and if you’re in home and you sweat, open the door to cool down the home. YOU DON’T SWEAT,"" they write.
The writer goes on to strip you off the rosy picture of having a 2/3BHK home in Siberia. Because the more the rooms, the more the wood needed to keep them warm. The user writes, ""Home does not mean a 3 bedroom American suburban house. It means a 300 sqft wood cabin. A single room, with some walls strategically placed around the door, to not let the cold air in. More rooms means more wood to heat everything. Wood is not infinite. You need to go into the forest with a few people, where 60% will keep a watch, 20% will cut, and the remaining 20% will do the odd jobs and gathering, cutting up of the trees felled. You can also sweat while cutting wood. YOU DON’T want to go for wood in middle of the winter. ""
""Sex isn’t taboo. It’s the same as America was during the period of settlers moving west. You will probably see your parents going at it. No worries, you’re not the weird one. The weird one is who’s not seen sex,"" the user writes.
In the second last pointer, the writer declares that finding jobs in this part of the world might not be the same as everywhere else. Survival is key. The person writes, ""There aren’t any jobs. Survival is your job.""
A non-acclimatised traveler from the tropics or warmer climes might want to halt in the lower North, before moving further to these brutal climatic conditions to let your body slowly get used to the plunging temperatures. Else, you could die. Explaining the same, the user writes, ""If you’re from a city like Miami, or from California, where the temperature doesn’t go below 0C, and it’s hot and humid, you can’t live here, without climate acclimatisation. You need to move north, slowly, spend a winter and then move further north. You can die from the cold, if you aren’t acclimatised.""
The Quora user's post has received 11.6 K upvotes and already has close to 184.2 K views.

2,India's hidden years of nuns abused by priests,[],2019-01-02 15:21:00,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201901/nuns-647x363.jpeg?0j3G7.XPp4t4IpTm.BnT2D3WV3yGynCu,"A Catholic nun stands at the foyer of the St. Francis Mission Home in Kuravilangad in the southern Indian state of Kerala. (Photo: AP Photo)
The stories spill out in the sitting rooms of Catholic convents, where portraits of Jesus keep watch and fans spin quietly overhead. They spill out in church meeting halls bathed in fluorescent lights, and over cups of cheap instant coffee in convent kitchens. Always, the stories come haltingly, quietly. Sometimes, the nuns speak at little more than a whisper.
Across India, the nuns talk of priests who pushed into their bedrooms and of priests who pressured them to turn close friendships into sex. They talk about being groped and kissed, of hands pressed against them by men they were raised to believe were representatives of Jesus Christ.
""He was drunk,"" said one nun, beginning her story. ""You don't know how to say no,"" said another.
At its most grim, the nuns speak of repeated rapes, and of a Catholic hierarchy that did little to protect them.
The Vatican has long been aware of nuns sexually abused by priests and bishops in Asia, Europe, South America and Africa, but it has done very little to stop it, The Associated Press reported last year.
Now, the AP has investigated the situation in a single country - India - and uncovered a decades-long history of nuns enduring sexual abuse from within the church. Nuns described in detail the sexual pressure they endured from priests, and nearly two dozen other people - nuns, former nuns and priests, and others - said they had direct knowledge of such incidents.
Still, the scale of the problem in India remains unclear, cloaked by a powerful culture of silence. Many nuns believe abuse is commonplace, insisting most sisters can at least tell of fending off a priest's sexual advances. Some believe it is rare. Almost none, though, talk about it readily, and most speak only on the condition they not be identified.
But this summer, one Indian nun forced the issue into the open.
When repeated complaints to church officials brought no response, the 44-year-old nun filed a police complaint against the bishop who oversees her religious order, accusing him of raping her 13 times over two years. Soon after, a group of her fellow nuns launched a two-week public protest in India's Catholic heartland, demanding the bishop's arrest.
It was an unprecedented action, dividing India's Catholic community. Inside the accuser's convent in rural Kerala state, she and the nuns who support her are now pariahs, isolated from the other sisters, many of whom insist the bishop is innocent. The protesting nuns get hate mail and avoid going out.
""Some people are accusing us of working against the church, of being against the church. They say, 'You are worshipping Satan,'"" said one supporter, Sister Josephine Villoonnickal. ""But we need to stand up for the truth.""
Villoonnickal has been a nun for 23 years, joining when she was a teenager. She scoffs at the idea that she wants to harm the church.
""We want to die as sisters,"" she said.
___
Some nuns' accounts date back decades - like that of the sister, barely out of her teens, who was teaching in a Catholic school in the early 1990s.
It was exhausting work, and she was looking forward to the chance to reflect on what had led her - happily - to convent life.
""We have kind of a retreat before we renew our vows,"" she said, sitting in the painfully neat sitting room of her big-city convent, where doilies cover most every surface, chairs are lined up in rows and the blare of horns drifts in through open windows. ""We take one week off and we go for prayers and silence.""
She had traveled to a New Delhi retreat center, a collection of concrete buildings where she gathered with other young nuns. A priest was there to lead the sisters in reflection.
The nun, who like others interviewed for this story spoke on condition she not be identified, is a strong and forceful woman who has spent years working with India's poor and dispossessed, from battered wives to evicted families.
But when she talks about the retreat her voice grows quiet, as if she's afraid to be overheard in the empty room: ""I felt this person, maybe he had some thoughts, some attraction.""
He was in his 60s. She was four decades younger.
One night, the priest went to a neighborhood party. He came back late, after 9:30 p.m., and knocked at her room.
?'I need to meet you,'"" he said when she cracked open the door, insisting he wanted to discuss her spiritual life. She could smell the alcohol.
""You're not stable. I'm not ready to meet you,"" she told him.
But the priest forced open the door. He tried to kiss her. He grabbed at her body, groping wherever he could.
Weeping, she pushed him back enough to slam the door and lock it.
It wasn't rape. She knows it could have been so much worse. But decades later she still reels at the memory, and this tough woman, for a few moments, looks like a scared young girl: ""It was such a terrifying experience.""
Afterward she quietly told her mother superior, who allowed her to avoid other meetings with the priest. She also wrote an anonymous letter to church officials, which she thinks may have led to the priest being re-assigned.
But nothing was said aloud. There were no public reprimands, no warnings to the many nuns the priest would work with through his long career.
She was too afraid to challenge him openly.
""I couldn't imagine taking that stand. It was too scary,"" she said. ""For me it was risking my own vocation.""
So the fierce nun remained silent.
___
Catholic history is filled with women who became martyrs to their own purity: Saint Agatha had her breasts torn off for refusing to marry; Saint Lucy was burned alive and stabbed in the throat for defending her virginity; Saint Maria Goretti was 11 years old when she was killed by a man who tried to rape her.
""It is a sin!"" Maria is said to have cried out. ""God does not want it!""
But for a nun, fighting off a priest's advances means pinballing through centuries-old sexual and clerical traditions. Celibacy is a cornerstone of Catholic religious life, as is sexual purity among nuns. Many nuns say a sister who admits to a sexual experience - even if it's forced - faces the risk of isolation within her order, and possibly even expulsion.
""You're not sure if you'll be kept in your congregation, because so much is about your vow of chastity,"" said Sister Shalini Mulackal, a New Delhi-based theologian. ""That fear is there for the young ones to disclose what has happened to them.""
At the same time, priests are seen as living representatives of Christ, with obedience to them another Catholic cornerstone.
Then there is the isolation of young women struggling to find their way in new communities after leaving their homes.
Caught at this intersection of sexual taboo, Catholic hierarchy and loneliness, sisters can be left at the mercy of predatory priests.
""There's a lot of emotion bottled up and when a little tenderness is shown by somebody it can be so easy for you to cross boundaries,"" said Sister Dorothy Fernandes, who has spent years working with the urban poor in eastern India. ""It can be hard to tell what is love and what is exploitation.""
It's particularly hard for sisters from Kerala, a deeply conservative region long the birthplace of most Indian nuns. Sex is rarely mentioned openly in small-town Kerala, boys and girls are largely kept apart, and a visible bra strap can be a minor crisis for a young woman.
""Once you grow up, once you get your first menstruation, you are not encouraged to speak normally to a boy. And the boys also vice-versa,"" said a nun from Kerala, a cheerful woman with sparkly glass earrings and an easy smile. She remembers the misery of Sunday mass as an adolescent, when boys would stand outside the church to watch girls filing in, eyes crawling over their young figures. ""We have a terrible taboo about sex.""
That naivety, she said, can be costly.
Like the time she was a novice nun, still in her teens, and an older priest came to the Catholic center where she worked. He was from Goa, a coastal region and former Portuguese colony.
She shook her head: ""I was in charge of visitors, and we had this bad habit of being hospitable.""
At one point, she brought the priest's laundry to his small room, where he was sitting. As she set down the clothes, he grabbed her and began to kiss her.
At first, she had no idea what was happening.
""The kissing was all coming here,"" she said, gesturing at her chest.
The confusion of that day is still clear on her face: ""I was young. He was from Goa. I am from Kerala. In my mind I was trying to figure out: 'Is this the way that Goans kiss?'""
She quickly understood what was happening but couldn't escape his fierce grip. She also could not call out for help: ""I cannot shout! He's a priest.""
""I didn't want to offend him. I didn't want to make him feel bad,"" she said.
So she pushed herself away from him until she could slip out the door.
She quietly told a senior nun to not send novices to the priest's room. But, like the nun who fought the drunken priest, she made no official complaint.
A complaint against a priest means leveling an accusation against someone higher in the church hierarchy. It can mean getting pulled into a tangle of malicious rumors and church politics. It means risking your reputation, and the reputation of your order.
In the church, even some of those who doubt there is widespread abuse of nuns say the silence can be enveloping.
Archbishop Kuriakose Bharanikulangara, a New Delhi-based church leader, calls incidents of abuse ""kind of sporadic. Once here, once there.""
But ""many people don't want to talk,"" he continued. ""They may talk in the community, but they don't want to bring it to the public, to the court.""
Speaking up can also risk financial troubles, since many congregations of nuns are financially subservient to priests and bishops.
The silence is magnified in India by demographics, religious politics and a deep-seated belief that women have little value.
There are roughly 18 million Catholics in India, but that's a small minority in this largely Hindu nation of 1.3 billion. Speaking up could tarnish the image of their church, many nuns worry, and feed criticism by Hindu hardliners.
""Even we, as religious sisters, even we try to keep it quiet,"" said Mulackal, the theologian. ""A woman who goes through this experience, she just wants to hide it and pretend everything is OK.""
___
The rapes, the nun says, happened in Room 20 of a small convent at the end of a one-lane road in rural Kerala.
Set amid rows of banana and rubber trees near the little town of Kuravilangad, the sisters at the St. Francis Mission Home spend their days in prayer or caring for the aged. In the garden, a statue of the Virgin Mary overlooks a decorative fish pond the size of a child's wading pool. The pond is covered in green scum.
The rapist, she says, was the most powerful man in this tiny small world: Bishop Franco Mulakkal.
Smart and ambitious, Mulakkal had risen from small-town Kerala to become a bishop in north India, overseeing a sprawling Catholic community. He was also the official patron of her community of 81 sisters, the Missionaries of Jesus, wielding immense influence over its budgets and job assignments.
The nun is a friendly woman with jet black hair known for her quiet confidence. Every few months, she says, Mulakkal would visit the St. Francis convent and summon her. Then, according to a letter she wrote to church officials, he raped her.
The letter says the first rape happened on May 5, 2014. The last time was Sept. 23, 2016. The dates are recorded in the convent's visitor logs.
Mulakkal angrily denies the accusations, telling reporters the charges were ""baseless and concocted"" and accusing the sister of trying to blackmail him into giving her a better job.
""I am going through painful agony,"" said Mulakkal, who was jailed for three weeks and released on bail in October. ""I tell everyone to pray to God: Let the truth prevail.""
Catholicism envelopes this part of Kerala. Towns are marked by their cathedrals, convents and roadside shrines, where the Virgin watches passing traffic or St. George slays the dragon. Businesses proclaim their owners' faith: St. Mary's Furniture and Bed Center; Ave Maria Electronics; Jesus Oil Industries.
Around here, many see Mulakkal as a martyr.
A string of supporters visited him in jail, and crowds greeted him when he returned home, a ring of policemen holding back people who showered him with flower petals. ""Hearty Welcome!"" a banner proclaimed.
But at the St. Francis convent, one group of nuns watched news reports about that welcome with dismay. While the sister leveling the accusations against Mulakkal does not speak publicly, a half-dozen nuns cluster around her, offering support and speaking on her behalf.
""Nobody came to see sister, but so many people came to wait in line to meet Bishop Franco in jail,"" said Villoonnickal, the nun, who moved back to Kerala to support the woman she calls ""our survivor sister.""
That sister was the second of five children in a Kerala family. Her father was in the army. Her mother died when she was in high school. Wracked with grief, she was sent to stay with a cousin - a priest - living in north India. Inspired by her time with him, she became a nun in 1994, working in her early years as a teacher.
She knew Mulakkal, of course. Everyone in the Missionaries of Jesus knows him. But the two were never close, the accuser's friends say, and had no consensual sexual relationship.
It was about fear.
""The bishop is such a powerful person and standing against him, where will she go?"" asked Villoonnickal. ""If she went home what will happen to her?""
""Many times she was telling him to stop. But each time he was forcing himself on her,"" she continued.
Eventually, they say, she told some sisters what was happening. Then she says she repeatedly complained to church authorities. When nothing happened, she went to the police.
She also went to confession.
There, according to the other nuns, she was told she had to resist the bishop.
?'Even if you have to die, don't submit yourself.'"" the priest told her in confession, according to Villoonnickal. ""'Be courageous.'""
Catholic authorities have said little about the case, with India's Catholic Bishops' Conference saying in an October statement that it has no jurisdiction over individual bishops, and that the investigation and court case, which could take many years, must run their course.
""Silence should in no way be construed as siding with either of the two parties,"" the group said. ""We request prayers for the Church at this difficult time.""
___
In Malayalam, the language of Kerala, sisters who leave the convent are sometimes marked as ""Madhilu Chadi"" - Wall Jumpers. It's a mocking term for the sexually frustrated and is often used for nuns and priests who have fled religious life.
Those who stay get respect. They have communities that embrace them. Their lives have direction, purpose. Those who leave often find themselves adrift in India, searching for new identities and spurned by families and friends. The events that knit families together - weddings, funerals, reunions - are suddenly off-limits. The emotional toll can be immense.
Speaking up about the church's troubles, many nuns say, could end with them forced from their convents, cut off in many ways from what they've always known.
""It's a fear of being isolated if I speak the truth,"" said the nun who fought off the drunken priest. ""If you do that, you have to go against your own community, your own religious superiors.""
The result is an engulfing silence. Silence is the armor that sisters use to protect themselves and the lives they have created, even if it also means struggling with their memories, and protecting the men who abused them.
In the end, most say nothing.
""I didn't tell anybody,"" said the nun who escaped the priest kissing her chest, and who waited many years to talk about what had happened to her. ""So you understand how these things are covered up."""
3,Zero Movie Review: Shah Rukh Khan gifts fans mindless Christmas release with Meerut and Mars,[],2018-12-21 13:45:00,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201812/zero-trailer-thumb-main-647x363.jpeg?ZqdSJiPjcaZ4OfJ2G0_ylsZW5I6EqzuF,"Do not try and find logic in a Salman Khan film. That became a learning long time ago. Leave your brain at home and enjoy the brawn, we told ourselves. Little did we know we would have to make peace with even brainless Shah Rukh Khan films. So when Aanand L Rai named his film Zero, he probably should have got his Maths correct. Because the name of his film might just be the closest metaphor to what Zero is.
'Bauna' Bauua Singh rules Meerut and Mumbai Queen Babita Kumari rules his life. He is 38 years old, vertically challenged and has barely matriculated. Bauua does not want to die a bachelor. So he lands up at a matrimonial agency's doorsteps, a photo of the girl from their portal in hand. But she is out of his league. Or so we think.
Scientist Aafiya Yusafzai Bhinder falls in love with this 'gaanwaar' and he serenades her with shooting stars. Till superstar Babita replaces Aafiya in Bauua's life by a stroke of pure, unbelievable luck. Babita Kumari needs a place in Alcoholics Anonymous. But awkwardly waltzes into the 'bauna's' heart. Life goes on, from smalltown Meerut to big city Mumbai and before you know it, director Aanand L Rai hurls the next missle at his audience: Mars.
Like they say in the best of sci-fi films from the West, a miscalculation of an inch lands a spacecraft several miles off its destination. The trajectory of Zero meets the same fate. Director Aanand L Rai's Zero starts well. Shah Rukh Khan plays to the gallery. He dances to Babita Kumari's tunes in the theatre as India dances to his tunes in theatres off screen. Khan romances both Sharma and Kaif with abandon. But he cannot save this disaster of a film.
The biggest front on which Zero scores a zero is logic. Writer Himanshu Sharma should have spent some time in researching the nitty-gritties of sending a spaceship to Mars before starting off on this tough journey. Director Aanand L Rai gives Shah Rukh Khan fans enough of the whistle-worthy moments. A lot of slapstick is thrown in to make Zero palatable. That does the trick. Zero gets its seetis and taalis. Shah Rukh rehashes his own elements and adds them to Zero too. There is a lot of romancing; complete with the outstretched arms and teary eyes and quivering lips. Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub as Bauua's best friend is a revelation in Zero. Zeeshan brings his comic timing from Raanjhanaa and gives the audience a best-friend duo to look out for, straight out of our Jai-Veeru tales; complete with the scooter and sidecar.
All of these external elements hardly help cover this shoddy tale of mismatched fortunes and love stories. Post intermission, especially in the last 20 minutes of the film, the desperation is visible. The writer and director are both clutching at the last straws and trying to give a befitting end to Zero. They have to try and make sense AND they have to keep Shah Rukh Khan fans happy. In this tussle, logic is thrown into the Pacific Ocean.
The film gets passable performances from its lead actors. Shah Rukh Khan is impressive as Bauua Singh. He gets into his a few-sizes-smaller shoes and does the Meerutiya act well. Anushka Sharma does a forgettable Stephen Hawking. Katrina Kaif burns everyone around her... to borrow a line from Shah Rukh Khan, ""She is soooo hot ... that we have to keep her in a tub on the sets."" But beyond her 'hotness', Katrina Kaif is the usual Katrina Kaif in a Khan film.
The music of the film is a winner, with special mention to Husn Parcham and Heer Badnaam. The cameo by Salman Khan and Bollywood actresses from Sridevi to Deepika Padukone are forced into the film to add to its star power. But without legs to stand on, the superficial can do only so much and no more. Zero the film, like its lead character Bauua Singh, falls short. Don't expect Zero to take you to Mars. Meerut, maybe.
Zero starring Shah Rukh Khan, Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif has hit the screens today. The film begins well and maintains pace in first half but is a disaster post intermission, says our review.
2 (no, not 0) stars on 5 for Zero.
(The writer tweets as @ananya116)
Trivia: Anushka Sharma got a wheelchair at home to practise moving around in one for nearly a month. Call it method acting or plain preparation, Anushka Sharma wanted to live the character Aafiya. She wanted to look natural and emote right.

The company in response has now outlined new policy to address complaints of sexual misconduct at the workplace.
""We recognise that we have not always gotten everything right in the past and we are sincerely sorry for that,"" AFP quoted Google CEO Sundar Pichai from note to his employees.
""Google has never required confidentiality in the arbitration process and it still may be the best path for a number of reasons (e.g. personal privacy, predictability of process), but, we recognize that the choice should be up to you.""
Pichai in his memo also promised that Google will now onwards be more transparent with how it handles sexual misconduct cases and offer more detailed report on such cases.
A part of the internal investigations report will have details on all such cases and disciplinary actions taken against them. Google also says that it will make some changes to the complaint system at the workplace. People will also be provided counsellor support in such matters.

Google has also asked team leaders to check on the alcohol consumption at company events . The leaders are expected to discourage the employees from excessive drinking at the events.
Google's response comes after more than 1,500 Google employees staged a walk-out from their offices in protest of the company's work culture and handling of sexual misconduct cases at the workplace The walk-out happened at more than 60 per cent of Google offices across the world.
The protest was in response to a New York Times report that said Google paid $90 million in exit package to Android creator Andy Rubin who had been accused of sexual misconduct by a Google employee. The report further added that Google in the past also had protected many of its employees who were accused of sexual misconduct by other employees. The walkout organisers demanded the company to make following changes to its policy:
-- An end to forced arbitration in cases of harassment and discrimination
-- A commitment to end pay and opportunity inequity
-- A publicly disclosed sexual harassment transparency report.
-- A clear, uniform, globally inclusive process for reporting sexual misconduct safely and anonymously
-- Elevate the Chief Diversity Officer to answer directly to the CEO and make recommendations directly to the board of directors. In addition, appoint an employee representative to the board."
5,France clears use of anti-spasm drug to treat alcoholism,[],2018-10-23 18:24:00,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/news-update_647.jpg?TWwu4jgsz736LQcqJV2XMXx9ufd7BjIf,"Saint-Denis, Oct 23 (AFP) French health authorities said Tuesday they have approved the use of a muscle relaxant to help treat people addicted to alcohol.
The ANSM national drug agency said it had cleared Baclofen, first developed in the 1970s, for alcoholism after a trial period that began in 2014, following years of off-label use in several countries.
But officials warned that the drug could have harmful side-effects, and limited its dosage to 80 milligrammes per day, down from 300 milligrammes previously.
Critics of the drug says its use to treat alcoholism has not been sufficiently proven, with some questioning the wisdom of trying to stop dependence on a product by replacing it with a pill.
But a French drug oversight agency said last year that while Baclofen had not been definitively shown to be efficient in treating alcoholism, it had shown ""clinical benefits in some patients"".
In its trial with 132 heavy drinkers, it found that 80 percent either became abstinent or turned into moderate drinkers.
By comparison, two other drugs that are commonly used to treat alcoholics, Naltrexon and Acamprosate, yielded a success rate of 20 to 25 per cent.
ANSM director Dominique Martin said Tuesday that the authorisation of Baclofen, sold under brand names including Kemstro, Lioresal and Gablofen, was necessary to meet ""a public health need"".
Refusing the drug ""did not seem reasonable to us given the needs and the seriousness of alcoholism, and the fact that tens of thousands of people are taking the medicine for this treatment,"" he said.
Interest in the treatment was sparked by a book published in 2008 by Olivier Ameisen, a French cardiologist who practiced in the US.
In ""Le Dernier Verre"" (The Last Drink), Ameisen describes successfully treating his alcoholism with high doses of Baclofen after failing with Alcoholics Anonymous and other standard treatments. (AFP) KUN KUN"
6,Initial Senate vote on Kavanaugh nomination set for Friday,[],2018-10-04 11:25:00,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/latest-news_647.jpg?BHoqtUADZyilFRhFVgtpv4a13MsaVovi,"Washington, Oct 4 (AP) The Senate braced for a crucial initial vote Friday on Brett Kavanaugh's tottering Supreme Court nomination after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell set his polarized chamber on a schedule to decide an election-season battle that has consumed the nation.
A showdown roll call over confirmation seemed likely over the weekend.
McConnell, R-Ky., cemented the process late Wednesday and announced that the FBI would soon deliver to an anxious Senate the potentially fateful report on claims that Kavanaugh sexually abused women.
With Republicans clinging to a razor-thin 51-49 majority and five senators including three Republicans still vacillating, the conservative jurist's prospects of Senate confirmation remained murky and dependent, in part, on the file's contents, which are supposed to be kept secret.
""There will be plenty of time for members to review and be briefed on the supplemental material"" before Friday's vote, McConnell said to the nearly empty chamber. In a rare moment of randomness in what's been a deadly serious process, the normally meticulous lawmaker's cell phone emitted a ringtone during part of his remarks.
Lawmakers were planning to begin reading the FBI report Thursday morning, with senators and a small number of top aides permitted to view it in a secure room in the Capitol complex. Senators are not supposed to divulge the contents of the agency's background reports.
The report was arriving at a Capitol palpably tense over the political stakes of the nomination fight and from aggressive anti-Kavanaugh protesters who have rattled and reportedly harassed senators. Feeding the anxiety was an unusually beefy presence of the US Capitol Police, who were keeping demonstrators and frequently reporters at arm's length by forming wedges around lawmakers walking through corridors.
Amid complaints that some lawmakers were being confronted outside their homes, McConnell claimed on the Senate floor that the protesters were ""part of the organized effort"" to derail Kavanaugh's nomination.
""There is no chance in the world that they're going to scare us out of doing our duty,"" he said.
Adding to the uncertainty, the three undecided GOP senators who could decide Kavanaugh's fate rebuked President Donald Trump for mocking one accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, by mimicking her responses to questions at last week's dramatic Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.
""I would tell him, knock it off. You're not helping,"" Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said of Trump's Tuesday night tirade.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Trump's insults marked a ""new low."" Barring leaks, it was unclear how much of the FBI report, if any, would be made public.
While senators from both sides have expressed support for revealing at least parts of the findings, FBI background checks on nominees are supposed to remain confidential.
Underscoring rising tensions, Democrats suggested that previous FBI background checks of Kavanaugh may have unearthed misconduct by the nominee.
Democrats wrote to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, challenging a Tuesday tweet by GOP aides saying prior investigations never found ""a whiff of ANY issue at all related in any way to inappropriate sexual behavior or alcohol abuse.""
Democrats wrote that the GOP tweet contained information that is ""not accurate."" Committee Republicans tweeted in response that their prior tweet was ""completely truthful"" and accused Democrats of ""false smears."" Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told reporters that Trump's lampooning of Ford at a Tuesday night Mississippi campaign rally was ""just plain wrong.""
Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, called it ""wholly inappropriate and in my view unacceptable,"" and Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., said on NBC's ""Today"" show that the remarks were ""kind of appalling."" Those senators, along with Democrats Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, have yet to declare how they will vote.
""All of us need to keep in mind there's a few people that are on the fence right now. And right now, that's sort of where our focus needs to be,"" said Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, who has traded barbs with Trump and will retire at year's end.
Trump drew laughs Tuesday with his rendition of how Ford answered questions at last week's hearing. ""I had one beer that's the only thing I remember,"" he stated inaccurately.
As he flew aboard Air Force One to the Mississippi rally, Trump was enraged by New York Times articles about Kavanaugh's high school and college years and alleging tax avoidance efforts by the president and his family, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Wednesday echoed the president's newly aggressive approach. She said Ford has ""been treated like a Fabergé egg by all of us, beginning with me and the president,"" and said Trump was merely ""pointing out factual inconsistencies.""
Trump himself didn't respond publicly to the criticism. On Twitter, he hailed Kavanaugh as ""a fine man and great intellect"" and insisted, ""The country is with him all the way!"" (AP) AMS AMS"
7,"Yale classmate recalls Kavanaugh as frequent, heavy drinker",[],2018-10-01 13:50:00,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/news-update_647.jpg?TWwu4jgsz736LQcqJV2XMXx9ufd7BjIf,"Washington, Oct 1 (AP) FBI agents interviewed one of the three women who have accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct as Republicans and Democrats quarreled over whether the bureau would have enough time and freedom to conduct a thorough investigation before a high-stakes vote on his nomination to the nation's highest court.
The White House insisted it was not ""micromanaging"" the new one-week review of Kavanaugh's background but some Democratic lawmakers claimed the White House was keeping investigators from interviewing certain witnesses.
President Donald Trump, for his part, tweeted that no matter how much time and discretion the FBI was given, ""it will never be enough"" for Democrats trying to keep Kavanaugh off the bench.
And even as the FBI explored the past allegations that have surfaced against Kavanaugh, another Yale classmate came forward to accuse the federal appellate judge of being untruthful in his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee about the extent of his drinking in college.
In speaking to FBI agents, Deborah Ramirez detailed her allegation that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party in the early 1980s when they were students at Yale University, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to publicly discuss details of a confidential investigation.
Kavanaugh has denied Ramirez's allegation.
The person familiar with Ramirez's questioning, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said she also provided investigators with the names of others who she said could corroborate her account.
But Christine Blasey Ford, a California professor who says Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers, has not been contacted by the FBI since Trump on Friday ordered the agency to take another look at the nominee's background, according to a member of Ford's team.
Kavanaugh has denied assaulting Ford.
In a statement released Sunday, a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh's said he is ""deeply troubled by what has been a blatant mischaracterization by Brett himself of his drinking at Yale.""
Charles ""Chad"" Ludington, who now teaches at North Carolina State University, said he was friend of Kavanaugh's at Yale and that Kavanaugh was ""a frequent drinker, and a heavy drinker."" ""On many occasions I heard Brett slur his words and saw him staggering from alcohol consumption, not all of which was beer.
When Brett got drunk, he was often belligerent and aggressive,"" Ludington said. While saying that youthful drinking should not condemn a person for life, Ludington said he was concerned about Kavanaugh's statements under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Speaking to the issue of the scope of the FBI's investigation, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said White House counsel Don McGahn, who is managing Kavanaugh's nomination, ""has allowed the Senate to dictate what these terms look like, and what the scope of the investigation is.""
""The White House isn't intervening. We're not micromanaging this process. It's a Senate process. It has been from the beginning, and we're letting the Senate continue to dictate what the terms look like,"" Sanders said.
White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said the investigation will be ""limited in scope"" and ""will not be a fishing expedition. The FBI is not tasked to do that."" Senate Judiciary Committee member Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., requested an investigation last Friday after he and other Republicans on the panel voted along strict party lines in favor of Kavanaugh's confirmation as a condition for his own subsequent vote to put Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court.
Another committee member, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Sunday that testimony would be taken from Ramirez and Kavanaugh's high school friend Mark Judge, who has been named by two of three women accusing Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.
""I think that will be the scope of it. And that should be the scope of it,"" Graham said.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, called on the White House and the FBI to provide the written directive regarding the investigation's scope. In a letter Sunday, she also asked for updates on any expansion of the original directive.
Sen. Susan Collins said Sunday she is confident in the investigation and ""that the FBI will follow up on any leads that result from the interviews."" The Maine Republican supports the new FBI investigation and is among a few Republican and Democratic senators who have not announced a position on Kavanaugh.
Republicans control 51 seats in the closely divided 100-member Senate and cannot afford to lose more than one vote on confirmation.
Collins and Flake spoke throughout the weekend.
Senate Republicans discussed the contours of the investigation with the White House late Friday, according to a person familiar with the call who was not authorized to discuss it publicly.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had gathered Judiciary Committee Republicans in his office earlier. At that time, the scope of the investigation was requested by Flake, Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, said McConnell's spokesman Don Stewart.

8,"Kavanaugh case: Fourth accuser comes forward, says has 4 people to corroborate sexual assault claims",[],2018-09-27 17:26:00,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/latest-news.jpg?RkRMzFRfJKMyxB.syxQdhxZFlLBwwnYp,"Washington, Sep 27 (PTI) Hours before Christine Blasey Ford is scheduled to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee that US President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school, a fourth woman has come forward to the panel, according to a media report.
The new allegations, submitted in the form of an anonymous complaint sent to Republican Senator Cory Gardner, were discussed with Kavanaugh on a call with Senate investigators, the NBC News reported Wednesday.
Kavanaugh has denied the allegation in the letter during the call, the report quoted sources as saying.
According to the letter, Kavanaugh in inebriated condition physically assaulted a woman he socialised with in Washington in 1998.
The sender of the complaint described an evening involving her own daughter, Kavanaugh and several friends in 1998.
""When they left the bar (under the influence of alcohol) they were all shocked when Brett Kavanaugh, shoved her friend up against the wall very aggressively and sexually. There were at least four witnesses, including my daughter,"" the letter stated.
The writer provided no names but said the alleged victim was still traumatised and had decided to remain anonymous herself, the report said.
This is the first complaint about Kavanaugh sexually harassing or assaulting a woman in his post-college years.
While the alleged assault of Ford took place when Kavanaugh was in high school, the second accuser, Deborah Ramirez, says that the Supreme Court judge nominee exposed himself to her at a party when both were freshman at Yale.
On Wednesday, another woman named Julie Swetnick accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct while in high school and alleged that she was ""gang-raped"" at a party he attended in the early 1980s.
Earlier in a press conference Thursday, Trump said he would consider withdrawing Kavanaugh's nomination if he ""thought he was guilty of something like this"". However, the President maintained that he believed the accusations against the conservative judge were ""false"". PTI SCY SCY SCY"

In a statement released to US media, Kavanaugh rejected the woman's claim, made in a letter to Democrats vetting his nomination, that he tried to force himself on her during a party while they were in high school.
""I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time,"" Kavanaugh said in the statement.
The allegation came just one week before the Senate Judiciary Committee is to vote on his nomination. If approved by the committee and the whole Senate, as has been expected, Kavanaugh is likely to decidedly tilt the court to conservatives for years to come.
Democrats fighting the nomination say that could turn the court away from guaranteed abortion rights, against programs that benefit disadvantaged minorities, and for greater presidential immunity from the law.
On Thursday Senator Dianne Feinstein, the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, announced cryptically that she had forwarded to the Federal Bureau of Investigation ""information from an individual concerning the nomination.""
The information came from an individual who wanted to remain anonymous and had declined to press the issue themselves, Feinstein said.
According to an account in the New Yorker, the incident happened while Kavanaugh, now 53, attended the elite Georgetown Preparatory Catholic all-boys high school in suburban Washington.
The woman, from a nearby high school, was allegedly at a party where the youths were drinking alcohol.
In a room with the woman, Kavanaugh and another male teen turned up the music and placed their hands over her mouth so that no one could hear, and Kavanaugh ""attempted to force himself on her,"" the New Yorker reported, citing the woman's account.
She struggled with them and escaped, the account said.
The woman ""said that the memory had been a source of ongoing distress for her, and that she had sought psychological treatment as a result,"" the New Yorker said.
Kavanaugh was quickly defended by friends and acquaintances from the time who cast doubts on the alleged incident.
A group of 65 women signed a letter attesting to his character.
""Through the more than 35 years we have known him, Brett has stood out for his friendship, character, and integrity. In particular, he has always treated women with decency and respect. That was true when he was in high school, and it has remained true to this day,"" they said. (AFP) KUN KUN"
10,'Drunchies' behind youth obesity epidemic,[],2018-08-08 13:06:00,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/news-update.jpg?_CvI.xRj7Yz.r47HEqlWEPEW3tS0M3Al,"Washington, Aug 8 (PTI) Drunchies, or the desire to eat salty, unhealthy foods after a night of heavy drinking, may be contributing to the obesity epidemic among college students, scientists say.
Researchers from University at Buffalo in the US decided to look at a sample of 286 college students to better understand how drinking affects what they eat, both that night and for their first meal the next day when, most likely, they are hungover.
""Given the obesity epidemic and the rates of alcohol consumption on college campuses, we need to be aware of not only the negative effect of alcohol consumption, but also the impact it has on what people are eating while they are drinking,"" said Jessica Kruger, an assistant professor at the University at Buffalo.
Research on the effects of drinking and diet is scarce, Kruger said, adding that eating more unhealthy foods following alcohol consumption is an often overlooked behaviour in traditional addiction research.
The inspiration for the study, published in the Californian Journal of Health Promotion, came from an ad researchers saw in a university newspaper.
""It said, 'Got Drunchies?' and had ads for pizza, tacos, and other fast-food places that were open late after the bars closed,"" Kruger said.
An average beer contains 150 calories. If a person drinks five beers, it accounts for third of their daily energy intake. Add two slices of pizza or a burrito to that at the end of the night, and it's a recipe for weight gain, she said.
""So, we dug a bit deeper and first figured out what the 'drunchies' were, and then decided this would be interesting to study,"" Kruger said.
Study participants were asked to complete an anonymous online survey.
Researchers found that drinking influenced study participants' dietary behaviours before going to bed.
All alcohol drinkers were more likely to eat something before they went to bed after drinking alcohol than in general before they go to bed.
Specifically, they were more likely to opt for salty snack foods and pizza. Healthy foods, such as dark green vegetables and other veggies they would ordinarily eat, were not as appealing.
Of particular concern, the researchers noted, was the fact that participants did not report drinking more water or other non-alcoholic beverages before bed.
That exacerbates dehydration, which may lead to additionally unhealthy food choices.
The following day after drinking, participants' dietary patterns varied from the night before. They were less likely to skip meals the morning after a night of drinking compared to a typical morning.
They favoured foods like pizza or tacos over milk and dairy products and grains, most likely because of the so-called hangover cures that get passed down to students and which entail eating foods that ""soak up"" the alcohol.
Dispelling these myths is one way to promote a healthy diet even after a night of binge drinking, Kruger said. PTI MHN MHN"

A bench of justices S Muralidhar and Vinod Goel questioned the rationale behind the IAF's decision, asking how it determined on a daily basis that the corporal still ""craved for alcohol"".
The court also said the newly-enacted Mental Health Act made it clear that a person could not be forced to undergo treatment without his consent, adding that the IAF ""cannot ignore the laws of the country"".
Terming the conduct of the IAF ""irresponsible"", the bench wondered how many of such cases there might be, which were yet to be highlighted.
""How were you determining on a daily basis that his craving for alcohol had not gone down? What tests were conducted by you? This is completely irresponsible. We wonder how many such cases are there.
""This is a clear case where a man is saying he has been detained without consent. Under the new Mental Health Act, you cannot force him to undergo treatment without his consent. Then how are you pumping him full of drugs? We do not know who should be proceeded against,"" the bench said.
It added that the IAF needed to be reminded not to interfere with a person's liberty as ""short of chaining him up, everything else was done here"" and directed that the corporal be produced in court tomorrow.
According to the IAF, represented by the Centre's standing counsel, Ripudaman Singh Bhardwaj, the action against the corporal was taken on a complaint from his wife that he turned violent after consuming alcohol.
Bhardwaj said the corporal, Kriyad Yogesh Bhankhariya, had alcohol dependency issues for which he was initially treated in the psychiatric ward of the Army Base Hospital here and thereafter, in June, he was shifted to the medical centre at the Tughlakabad Air Force Station.
The court said if the non-commissioned officer (NCO) was an alcoholic, then the IAF ought to have sought the help of the ""Alcoholics Anonymous"" on how to deal with the matter as any psychiatric would confirm that confinement of a person was advisable only in extreme cases.
""It is worrying, the manner in which you have approached the situation,"" the bench told the IAF.
The court was hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by the 30-year-old corporal's father, claiming that his son was being illegally confined at the Army Base Hospital. PTI HMP SKV RC RC"

""It was awful, terrible,"" he told The Guardian while talking about his struggle. ""It owned me.""
""When I watch that film back, I can see where I was then, which was fairly lost, and unhappy, and an alcoholic,"" Pegg added.

Psychedelic drugs act on serotonin receptors in the brain. Classic psychedelics include lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin (magic mushrooms), mescaline, and dimethyltryptamine (DMT).
The effects vary but can produce mystical experiences and changes in perception, emotion, cognition and the sense of self. Classic psychedelics are not considered to be addictive.
""Although use of certain drugs like alcohol, methamphetamine or cocaine is associated with increased aggression and partner violence, use of psychedelics appears to have the opposite effect,"" said Michelle Thiessen, a graduate student at University of British Columbia in the Canada.
""We found that among men who have used psychedelics one or more times, the odds of engaging in partner violence was reduced by roughly half. That's significant,"" said Thiessen.
""Previous research from our lab that looked at men in the criminal justice system found that hallucinogen users were substantially less likely to perpetrate violence against their intimate partners,"" said Zach Walsh, a professor at UBC.
""Our new study is important because it suggests that these effects might also apply to the general population,"" said Walsh.
Researchers, including those from Laurentian University in Canada, based their results on an anonymous online survey of 1,266 people recruited from universities and through social media.
Respondents were asked to disclose their lifetime use of LSD and psilocybin mushrooms and then complete a questionnaire that assessed multiple aspects of their emotion regulation.
""Past research found a clear association between psychedelic drug use and reduced partner violence, but the reasons for this effect remained unclear,"" said Thiessen.
""We found that better ability to manage negative emotions may help explain why the hallucinogen users were less violent,"" she said.
""These findings add to the literature on the positive use of psychedelics and suggest that future research should explore the potential for psychedelic therapies to help address the international public health priority of reducing domestic violence,"" she added. PTI MHN MHN MHN"

Are you drinking over-priced alcohol in Delhi's pubs that actually belong to the smuggled lot? The authorities including the excise department are worried about the excessive smuggling of liquor from Haryana. What is more worrisome is the fact that the smuggled liquor from Haryana might turn fatal as the liquor mafia are mixing the alcohol with other chemical-based drinks to increase the quantity.
The Excise Intelligence Bureau seized more than 3.2 lakh liquor bottles that were illegally smuggled into, stored or sold within the capital in last one year. Both Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal are keen to curb the activities of the liquor mafia and regulate liquor sale keeping in view public safety, particularly of women.
""Smuggled liquor becomes fatal when mixed with chemicals and repacked in new bottles. Adulteration of liquor is a major concern as it can lead to fatalities. At times the smugglers are mixing methanol or ethanol with liquor to increase the quantity which is a worrying sign for us as that could result in a huge tragedy,"" an official requesting anonymity said.
Meanwhile sources in the excise department said: ""Large quantities of branded liquor are smuggled into the Capital from Haryana, which find their way into pubs and other social functions.""
According to the department, liquor is illegally brought to Delhi largely from Haryana. Excise intelligence has identified certain areas where such gangs operate. These include Wazirpur JJ colony, Jahangirpuri, Sultanpuri, Mangolpuri, Shakurpur, Raghubir Nagar, Uttam Nagar, Sagarpur, Sangam Vihar and Nand Nagri.
""The smugglers are dodging the cops and excise department by creating false cavities in the trucks and cars. Also, the smugglers are using second-hand luxury cars to smuggle liquor from Haryana to Delhi-NCR,"" Chinmoy Biswal, DCP (South-East) told Mail Today.
""Concealed chambers are set up in trucks and containers to smuggle liquor from Haryana. Several such cases were detected by the excise teams and the police in the past"" the official said.
Officials from the state excise department are trying to be one up on this mafia. Another official said that the smugglers are also using the plastic bottles as against glass only to ensure ease of transportation with lesser chances of breakage.
""Some liquor is smuggled in huge trailers and trucks unlike the usual route involving small vehicles. The illegal consignment is hidden under boxes of medicines or sanitary pads (as they are light),"" the official said.
A senior official claimed that the main liquor mafia always hides under anonymity as the nature of the business.

He claimed that he had never done anything wrong with the patients.
The director even invited this reporter to visit the centre to see ""through her own eyes"".
The reporter had, in fact, visited the premises and met all the seven ""victims of rehab horror'' and had recorded their version.
Narrating the ordeal, a patient told this MAIL TODAY reporter: ""I am a drug addict and I got admitted here 16 days ago. Since then my parents have not paid any visit. I want to talk to them as I am not being treated here. Rather, I have become a victim of gay director who always touches me inappropriately. I am not comfortable in pleasing his sexual desires.""
Another patient added, ""The director called me to his office. Pressed my lower back and touched my private parts. I tried to run away, but he caught me and started threatening me in abusive language. I was scared.""
""One night his gay partners came and consumed alcohol. They called me inside their room and made me watch a porn film. A few minutes later, one of them inserted his finger into my anus and asked me to become used to it,"" said a 20-year-old boy who is presently out of the rehab centre.
One of the patients, requesting anonymity, said: ""We were made to learn how to give body massages. All of them used to call us in their room in the night and ask for the body massage. They force us to seduce them and touch their private parts. Last month, the director forced me oral sex, but I resisted. He then started beating me before leaving me red and blue.""
When the reporter questioned these victims about the reason why were they silent and haven't taken any action against them, they claimed that they were scared.
""We have narrated the ordeal to our counselor who assured us justice,"" they said.
This reporter contacted the director; he refused to buy these allegations.
""There is some conspiracy against me. I am a gay but have never touched any of my patients inappropriately. I used to give them a very friendly atmosphere.""
The reporter learned that almost four years ago, a sexual assault complaint was registered by a patient against the director when he was heading another rehab centre in Pasonda.
He was reportedly arrested and remained behind the bars. After coming out of the jail, he started another rehab centre in Seemapuri and continued his act.
However, when he was asked about these facts, the director rubbished such reports too.
Speaking to Mail Today, the official concerned with whom a fresh complaint was made on Sunday confirmed that a complaint has been received.
A senior official said the police are following the guidelines to conduct the preliminary investigation of the case first before registering an FIR."

The 25-year-old singer said it was a ""very cliquey"" party.
""I had a terrible experience. This one celebrity was a complete b**tch and was miserable to be around. It was very cliquey... I remember being so uncomfortable that I wanted to drink,"" Lovato, who has been sober for six years, told Billboard.
She said she ditched her party clothes but went to the 10 pm meeting wearing her diamonds.
""I changed my clothes, but I still had my diamonds on-millions of dollars of diamonds on in an AA meeting. And I related more to the homeless people in that meeting who struggled with the same struggles that I deal with than the people at the Met Gala-fake and sucking the fashion industrys d**k,"" Lovato said.

Drugs, alcohol, sex and corrupt officials in khaki.
A youth on the request of anonymity has come forward with allegations of a flourishing drug trade and corrupt jail officials in Punjab.
The youth hails from Kapurthala district of Punjab. His elder brother was arrested and jailed by the Punjab Police on charges of murder five years ago when he was just 20. This youth who was hesitant to come on record says he paid nearly Rs 60,000 to his brother who wanted to use a mobile phone in the jail besides getting the barrack of his choice. The money, according to him was paid by his brother to the Kapurthala jail officers.
Family members of nine Kapurthala jail undertrials and convicts in a letter written to the registrar Punjab and Haryana High Court have levelled serious allegations against the jail authorities.
Targeting the Kapurthala jail superintendent Surender Pal Khanna they have accused him of exploiting the jail inmates.
According to Vikram Satpal Anand, advocate, Punjab and Haryana High Court one single paracetamol tablet is sold for Rs 500 in Kapurthala Central Jail. A single bundle of beedis is sold for Rs 250 and a single cigarette is sold for Rs 300 and if you want to use a mobile phone just pay Rs 5,000 to the jailer and call anywhere without any worry.
AIDS-INFECTED CONVICTS USED TO TERRORISE THE TRIALS
According to Vikram Satpal Anand the accused jailer Surender Khanna uses convicts who have AIDS to terrorize the healthy convicts. The victims are then asked to pay money to shift the AIDS patient to a designated barrack.
Gangsters also pay money to save their lives. Dreaded gangsters are also being exploited by the corrupt jail officers. They are threatened to put in the barrack of rival gangs. The gangsters are then asked to pay money for not changing their barrack.
JAIL INMATES ARE SODOMIZED
Gurdeep Inder Singh Dhillon, a lawyer, who is contesting cases of some jail inmates, has said the undertrials and convicts in Punjab jails are also sodomized by the sex-starved convicts, a sizeable chunk of whom are infected with AIDS .
The accused jailer is already facing a similar case which is pending in Punjab and Haryana High Court. He is accused of beating-up a doctor in Ludhiana who served as a jail doctor. The accused jailer would ask the doctor to charge Rs 5,000 for an injection from the jail inmates but when he refused, he was severely beaten up there. The doctor approached the Punjab and Haryana High Court which has ordered a probe into the allegations.
The accused jailer Surender Pal Khanna was not available for a comment and refused to come on camera.

It's not just a cause for concern in the West, but closer home, as well. On Day 1 of the India Today South Conclave 2018, actresses Sruthi Hariharan and Pranitha Subhash along with film editor Bina Paul, spoke about sexism in cinema.
Excerpts from the conversation:
ON THE WARPED GENDER RATIO ON THE FILM SETS
Pranitha: The actress or the heroine, as they call it, comes last in the hierarchy. She has the least power of decision making. I'll give you an example. I was doing a film where I played the wife of a Naxalite. My introduction scene was supposed to be me running to my room, but the camera angle was not in my control. It was shot in slo-mo, a Baywatch kind of thing. I was ashamed when I saw what was done to that simple shot.
Sruthi: There is absolutely no depth in how the character is developed. They just require you to be a pretty face and flaunt your assets. That is what sells and that is sad. It is sad that the body sells. Men have professions - doctor, engineer, journalist - but what does a woman do? She is just known as somebody's daughter.
Bina: There is a lack of women not only on sets but many aspects on filmmaking, policy making and the creative aspects. There are no proper toilets for women. If you have a complaint, there is no one you can complain to. And this is happening in the industry which produces the largest number of films.
Sruthi: It reflects in every other industry, not just the film industry. Women are under-represented everywhere.
ON THE CASTING COUCH
Pranitha: I have been very lucky to not have experienced the casting couch, but I'm sure it exists. Even something as simple as voicing your opinion, you will face a lot of backlash. Take the case of Parvathy. She was trolled just for calling out the misogyny in the film of a superstar. There was another case of the film of a superstar, where in the poster, he is walking, and the actress is crawling behind him. An actress called it regressive, and even though she did not name the film, fans of the superstar began trending #WeHateXYZ.
Sruthi: I have had experiences of the casting couch. I was 18, and I was going for the meeting of my first Kannada film. I was a dancer before I entered films and I went and told my choreographer. He said, 'If you do not know how to handle this, leave right now.' I did not do that film.
Then, a leading Tamil producer bought the rights of my Kannada film and asked me to reprise my role. He called me and said, ""We are five producers, we will exchange you amongst us however we want (rough translation)."" This happened four years after my first experience.
This time I knew how to handle it and said that I always carry a slipper in my hand and I will hit him. Word spread that I am weird and difficult to work with. Since then, I have not got good offers in Tamil cinema.
Bina: Where does the actress go? There is no one to take any action.
Pranitha: I think the need of the hour is a system where we can complain in anonymity.
ON ITEM NUMBERS OBJECTIFYING WOMEN
Sruthi (on Dabangg song Fevicol Se, choreographed by Farah Khan): It is choreographed by a woman, but let's forget the choreography. Let's look at the lyrics. ""Gatka le saiyaan alcohol se"", is it?
Pranitha: A lot of the people who are watching this are men in B and C centres. We are just giving them what they want.
Bina: These are all signs of a deeply patriarchal society. You think the audience wants it, they get it and want more of it.
ON WHETHER YOU CAN SURVIVE IN THE INDUSTRY BY TURNING THESE FILMS DOWN
Sruthi: I have done a lot of roles which I am very proud of.
Pranitha: Most of the films which I have done so far fall under commercial cinema. By definition, the woman is just the eye candy. She has to be glamourous and bubbly. The kind of visibility you get with these films, you cannot ignore.
Bina: Perhaps it's an important thing to not look at this as a war between the sexes just yet. Maybe a lot of people just don't know any better. An awareness has to be built. Everyone has to go along, otherwise you'll get isolated. It should be like, yes, we will do this together. You will not speak up if your career is at stake.
ON PRABHAS FORCING TAMANNAAH IN BAAHUBALI
Pranitha: Cinema being a reflection of society, certain things which are included in films are what people want to see. 80 per cent of the people didn't even think something was wrong with that.
Bina: And there lies the problem.
Sruthi: Films which treat the characters as objects sell. Forget that, films which are treated as a business-making model sell.

He then took her naked body to her family at their Malviya Nagar home and confessed.
Mail Today has learnt that a month before the incident, the woman, who is a divorcee, aborted the accused’s child. Since then, she was purportedly pushing him to get married.
Rita Ahuja (name changed) had separated from her husband with whom she had a 12-year-old son. The boy lives with his grandparents in Malviya Nagar. She and the accused, Shahbad Khan, worked together at a healthcare company.
He allegedly befriended her eight months ago on the pretext of marriage. “In July, when Rita conceived, he forced her to abort the child. Since then, she was pushing him to get married. But he started ignoring her. On the day of the incident, they went out and consumed alcohol. They had a heated argument over marriage and after having sex in the car he strangled her,” said Mahesh Kumar (name changed), an associate of Rita.
The incident took place on August 27 last year and the accused has now been sent into judicial custody. The FIR accessed by Mail Today says Khan, a resident of Ghaziabad, confessed and claimed that at the time of the incident both of them were drunk.
“While having sex at the front seat of the car, he strangled her. A few hours later, when he realised that he had killed Rita, he rushed her to the latter’s family and informed them about the incident,” it says, quoting Khan’s statement.
The accused was arrested after Rita’s father lodged a police complaint at Malviya Nagar police station last year. “He has been booked under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code after he confessed the crime,” said a police official close to investigation.
Rita’s father told the police that his daughter and the accused consumed alcohol around 1am that night and parked the car at Sheikh Sarai. “They had a heated argument and that is when Khan strangled her,” Rita’s father told the police, quoting Khan’s statement when he brought the body to their residence.
The victim’s family along with Khan rushed her to AIIMS where she was declared brought dead. Speaking to Mail Today, the doctors, who conducted the autopsy, on the condition of anonymity said, “The accused narrated to us the sequence of incident. He confessed that they were having sex inside the parked car and he strangled her. During medical examination, it was learnt that he strangled her with such a force that her neck bones were broken. And she died immediately due asphyxiation (lack of oxygen).”
It has been learnt that the deceased Rita, 38, was a resident of South Delhi’s Malviya Nagar. She was the mother of a 12-year-old boy who is studying in a reputed school in south Delhi.
Rita tied the knot in 2002 in what was a love marriage. Her husband worked in a top airline and was often out of town. After a few years, she learnt that he was having an affair.
Speaking to Mail Today, Rita’s father claimed that the family did not know about her relationship with Khan. “Recently, we learnt that Khan used my daughter only for money. Rita was supposed to give him Rs 60,000 but due to some reason she failed,” he alleged.
Khan is now lodged in Tihar jail. His family could not be reached for comments. Senior police officials of south Delhi district were also mum on the issue."

The self-styled godman reportedly complained of uneasiness and restlessness to the team of doctors who examined him at the Rohtak jail.
According to sources, the Dera chief is believed to have told the doctors that the health issues are a physical manifestation of some withdrawal symptoms he is suffering from.
""The baba is, in fact, a sex addict. He has no access to physical pleasures in the jail which is the cause for his restlessness. He can be treated. However, if the treatment is delayed, it can lead to a bigger problem,"" said a doctor who was part of the team that examined Ram Rahim in the jail.
ALSO READ: What is sex addiction? How does one get addicted to sex?
It, however, remains unclear if Gurmeet Ram Rahim was addicted to drugs as well. Some reports suggest that the Dera chief consumed alcohol till 1988. ""He may not be drinking liquor now, but he regularly consumed energy drinks and sex tonics that were specially imported from Australia and other countries,"" claimed Gurdas Singh Toor, a former Dera member.

RAM RAHIM TOLD COURT THAT HE IS IMPOTENT
Notably, Gurmeet Singh, who did not leave any stone unturned to prove himself innocent, told the special CBI court that he was impotent.
After taking over as the Dera chief in 1990, Ram Rahim publicly renounced his family and worldly desires.
When an anonymous letter accusing Ram Rahim of rape, written by one of the victims, surfaced, he told people that the girls were under pressure to give false statements. He alleged that his opponents had bribed the victims.
""He is a liar as he was never impotent. His son was a few months old when he became a Dera chief in 1990. He is accused of raping his disciples. When people demanded for his potency test, he retracted his 1990 statement and said he had physical relations with only his wife. He wanted to mislead the court. Why nobody has got his potency test done so far is another loophole,"" Gurdas Singh Toor, who appeared as a witness for the CBI, told India Today.
Was the demand to allow Honeypreet to stay with him in jail meant to satiate physical needs?
Gurmeet Ram Rahim had requested the jail authorities to allow Honeypreet, his closest aide, to stay with him in the jail. He had reportedly threatened the jail staff when Honeypreet was asked to leave the jail complex. The Dera chief told the jail authorities that Honeypreet was his physiotherapist.
Interestingly, Gurmeet Ram Rahim did not demand the presence of either a male attendant, his biological daughters, or even his wife. His only demand was that Honeypreet be allowed to stay with him as his attendant.
When he failed to meet Honeypreet in the jail, Ram Rahim requested authorities to let him speak to her over phone. However, Ram Rahim's hopes were dashed when Honeypreet, slapped with a sedition case, went underground.

Mojos Bistro and 1 Above were the two restaurants where fire broke out on December 29th killing 14 persons and causing huge damage to property.
Major findings suggest unauthorised storage of combustible material, construction of illegal shed and flooring, lack of license from fire officer. Major safety regulations were not obeyed by the management.
Some of the findings are listed below:
1. Staircase and emergency way leading to it was blocked by doors, decorative material partitions, barricades resulting in complete blockage of the escape route.
2. Both 'Mojo's bistro' and '1 Above' restaurants didn't have any permision to build thatched roof. The restaurants had used bamboo frames and covered the terrace illegally with tarpaulin, nylon sheets.
3. Combustible materials like alcohol, plywood, partition sheets, cloth were stored on the terrace itself.
4. Charged CO2 cylinders were found on terrace.
5. Smoking cigarettes and Hukkah was allowed illegally. Charcoal sigri was use to burn coal for Hukkah.
6. Dangerous fire tricks were performed by bartenders illegally.
7. Both, Mojo and 1 Above were selling Hukkah and liquor without permission. Basement of the building was used for activities which were not permitted.
8. Fire fighting system of the building was not in working condition.
The fire department report notes that there were around 300 people present inside both the restaurants at the time of the incident. When the fire broke out, everyone started rushing to the lifts. But escape using lifts was not possible.
The situation worsened as the escape routes were obstructed as a result of which people in 1 Above were not able to escape in time.
The report further adds that,the falling debris of 1 Above restaurant forced people to seek shelter in a toilet. But this proved fatal as 14 people died due to asphyxiation.
An official requesting anonymity said that, one of the bouncers employed by the restaurant management died in the carnage. This points to the fact that even staffers did not know the escape route. Had they known it, they would have been able to guide the guests to safety
The investigation report also mentions the owners of Mojo's Bistro which includes some influential people who till date haven't been blamed by police or the BMC for the fire."
23,"Mumbai fire puts Delhi on alert mode, authorities roll in two-wheeler fire tenders",[],2017-12-30 06:26:11,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/hauz-khas-2-1_647_123017051547_1.jpg?BIHmmLJZ4_t9R2gND0dkW0N_BSyT6jLx,"The lack of fire safety at the Capital's party hot-spots has emerged as a burning question against the backdrop of a massive blaze killing 14 people at a popular Mumbai restaurant on Friday.
While nightlife haunt Hauz Khas Village is notorious for its cramped streets and eateries that have turned it into a tinderbox, authorities are rolling in two-wheeled fire tenders into the narrow lanes to keep the area secure with New Year's Eve revelries around the corner.
Officials in the fire department told Mail Today that the decision to station the firefighting bikes at the south Delhi neighbourhood was taken after the tragedy at Mumbai's Kamala Mills, an industrial compound with high-end restaurants and other commercial establishments.
Among those killed in the fire at a rooftop pub past midnight was a woman celebrating her 28th birthday and many of her friends. Dozens of others were injured. Of the more than 120 eateries in HKV, just four have a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the fire department.
""In case any mishap happens, the fire tenders cannot reach inside the narrow lanes especially during peak times when thousands of people choose Hauz Khas Village for celebrations. The visitors also park the vehicles at the roadside as the official parking area remains full. This in turn makes the road narrower,"" an official said.
He added that the bike fire tenders are the quickest relief possible in the cramped area. Two cylinders are installed on both the sides of a bike. Each cylinder has a capacity of around 20 litres and carries a mix of water and foam.
Last year, a fire broke out at Hauz Khas Village, killing a young businessman and injuring a Frenchwoman in an incident that underscored the Capital's poor safety standards and pervasive failure to enforce laws. The episode stirred authorities into action, with crackdowns on encroachment and negligence at places such as HKV and Connaught Place.
Heavy footfall ""Keeping in mind the heavy footfall at Hauz Khas Village, these bikes will be stationed in advance. If a fire breaks out, assistance will be provided with the help of fire tenders and foam cylinders. The geography of this nightlife hub is such that in case a fire engine enters the narrow lane, another cannot go inside until the first one comes out,"" an official explained.
Many of the restaurants are run from second and third floors, making them vulnerable to accidents and natural disasters. In case of a fire, a rescue operation becomes difficult. A pub was gutted in the area during Diwali a few years ago.
While the trendy bars and upmarket location draw both Indian and foreign patrons to Hauz Khas Village, officials say the place is a hub of illegal commercial establishments.
""If a restro-cum-bar has less than 50 seats then it does not require an NOC from the fire department! This is the eligibility criteria that almost all the restro-cum-bars in the narrow lanes of Hauz Khas Village in south Delhi are taking advantage of. MCD must be grilled for providing these restaurants the licence to run. Also, Delhi Police plays another key role in their existence,"" chief fire officer Atul Garg told Mail Today.
""The pubs and discotheques are vulnerable places that can see high number of casualties,"" Garg said, pointing to the single entry-exit gates, loud music, dim lights and visitors being under the influence of alcohol.
""All these factors lead to early fire warnings going unnoticed."" Sources say to bypass the system, one individual opens three different restaurants spread across three floors - in one premises or building - thereby abiding by the below 50 seating rules. This is a very common practice in all these major market areas. MAIL TODAY had reported the matter last year when Delhi Police had raised the issue with the then lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung.
Another official requesting anonymity said that the firefighting bikes are only precautionary measures they won't be able to handle a massive blaze. However, these bikes can be used at the initial stages to stop the flames from spreading, the official said.
Sources said the only four of the eateries at Khan Market have a fire NOC while as many as 114 restaurants and bars in Connaught Place have the certificate.

Top excise officials of Millennium City say they expect liquor consumption on the night to triple compared to other days.
Parties have kicked off in Gurugram from Christmas and authorities believe around 1.27 lakh litres of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) will be consumed on December 31 at nightclubs, three to five-star hotels as well as private bashes.
Gurugram has 288 discotheques with bar licences.
""Since they exist in upmarket entertainment hubs, they attract a large number of people from Delhi, Faridabad and other neighbouring districts of Haryana. Even domestic and foreign tourists who come to Delhi in the winters visit nightclubs of Gurugram and so demand goes higher,"" said Harish Dahiya, deputy excise and taxation commissioner (west) in Gurugram.
The Delhi excise department too expects the year to end on a high note with a Rs 50-crore rise in earnings this month compared to November.
Speaking to Mail Today, a source said the revenue will cross Rs 425 crore by the end of December with Rs 385 crore already generated.
In December 2016, the city excise department had accrued about Rs 395 crore. Sources said this New Year's Eve, Delhi is going to be high on whisky, and beer is the second preference.
As the demand is high on December 31, nightclubs stock large quantities of popular alcohol brands, beer, vodka, wine and other variants in advance.
""We have already made adequate arrangements. Besides, various lucrative offers such as rebate in couple entry and advance booking are expected to draw customers,"" said the owner of a prominent nightclub at Gurugram's sector 29 market.
The proprietor of another discotheque at CyberHub said on condition of anonymity, ""We have offered unlimited liquor consumption-unlimited fun at a fixed cost. This has been advertised through signboards and a lot of requests are coming in.""
According to data available with Mail Today, Gurugram sees consumption of 42,534 litre of IMFl on an average day.
Apart from this, 22,000 litre of domestic liquor is also consumed. Most nightclubs in the city have capacity for up to 50 guests, but they pack in around 200 or may on special occasions like New Year celebrations.
Dahiya said the excise department keeps a close watch on overcrowded venues where chances of hooliganism and mishap are high.
One such incident took place on December 31, 2011, when a group of miscreants molested a girl on MG Road in the presence of police personnel.
""The nightclubs of Gurugram are teeming on the last day of the year and so we have constituted 14 teams headed by AETOs (assistant excise & taxation officers) to closely monitor them each headed.
They will work in tandem with police personnel. The AETOs will have special powers to challan in case of violation of excise norms,"" Dahiya said.
Ravinder Kumar, the public relations officer of Gurugram police, said, ""Besides barricading on Mall Mile, we have decided to deploy a police team comprising male and female personnel to prevent any kind of hooliganism.""
He said the traffic department has initiated a special anti-drinking drive from December 25.

At an era when even job interviews take over Skype, there's a rapid incline towards using social media and online message platforms to interact with people. It's not just lazy, but is also contributing towards giving the tech-savvy a whole lot of social and mental issues.
Excessive reliance on technology has been identified as a significant contributor towards social alienation. Over the last few decades, technology has taken over our lives. It's changed the way we relate with your work, our friends and ourselves.
Dr Samir Parikh, consultant psychiatrist and director of the department of mental health and behavioural sciences, Fortis Healthcare, says, ""Technological advancements have made aspects of our lives easier, made information and people more easily accessible. But, it has also aggravated a kind of social alienation, relative deprivation, stress and poor lifestyle choices. Social alienation could translate into a preference for communication via social media as compared to direct interpersonal interactions. Excessive use also impacts a person's self esteem, especially as the youngsters tend to get caught up in paying excessive significance to the evaluations and approvals made by the online world.""
Stating that today, a person doesn't even leave the house to communicate with others as everything can be done at the click of a button, and so, technology has replaced relationships rather than supplementing them, Dr Rahul Chandhok, psychiatrist, Lybrate, adds ""People who use social media excessively tend to neglect personal life, suffer from mental preoccupation and escapism, have mood modifying experiences and negative tolerance to any situation.""

Dr. Manish Jain, consultant, Psychiatry, BLK Super Speciality Hospital, says, ""Excessive use of social media is addictive, although it hasn't been classified as a separate disorder yet, though it should be.""
However Dr Rahul says that internet addiction is now being included as a disorder which needs further study and research. ""The anxiety is due to the constant pressure to present a perfect and unrealistic image of themselves to impress others. The digital world is changing society in a way which can make people feel that they are under constant surveillance, with every action tracked and activity recorded in some way through the internet, which can lead to paranoia.""
POINTING out that social media promotes unhealthy competition, makes one focus more on unnecessary narcissism, fake commitments and unwanted social conformity, Dr Shweta Sharma, consultant, Clinical Psychologist, Columbia Asia Hospital, Gurgaon, says, ""Paranoia is a tendency to be suspicious about everything, whether it is someone, some place, some group or some object. Though it's related to type of personality disorder, it's fast becoming a habit due to excessive use of social networking sites. Poor attention span, memory loss, temper tantrums and frequent bursts of anger are also consequences of being too involved in the virtual world.""

But, who decides how much is too much?
Dr Samir says, ""Many people can't bear to imagine the thought of a technology-free zone daily, even for a couple of hours at a stretch. I think that's when you know you're in trouble."" However, there's no way to determine how much time on social media is too much. Dr Rahul says, ""It is all about self-regulation at the end of the day. Spending more than an hour in a day indulging in an activity can be taken as obsession. If a person starts getting addicted to check apps constantly and suffers from sleep disorders and other side effects, it is time for a reality check.""
Dr Shweta argues, ""Some people are using it for their business advertisement purpose or maintaining their contacts through it, some students are using for educational discussion or awareness. So, limiting time is not a solution. We should be more focused about its proper use and keep a lookout for warning signs.
You can also start social media detox by taking one day off from social media in any form or have specific time spans wherein you are active online. Dr Samir says, ""Switch off from technology and forms of social media on a regular basis, and don't let social media be a substitute for relationships.

Adds Dr Rahul, ""You first need to review your usage and understand the amount of time you spend on social media every day. You could consult a counsellor for this. There are many people who are doing that.""
The second step, he reckons is acknowledging your addiction, which is the first step towards overcoming any addiction.
""Deactivate your account and delete apps. This will ensure that you do not get the urge to check and post every other time,"" he adds. Dr Shweta opines that will power is what it takes to cure your social media pangs. ""Unfortunately, this will power is also becoming negative because of social media. So, we first need to reestablish our will power through meditation and relaxation therapies aided by psychologists.""

THE PRICE OF ANONYMITY
While many get hooked to SARAHAH, doctors talk about how this app is probably not apt for India, as it induces cyber-bullying.
So where does that leave the amount of ruckus Sarahah, the anonymous message sending app, can cause, especially in India?
The very fact that such an application is gaining popularity amongst the youth is in itself a reflection of the vulnerability bred by social media platforms, with the overemphasis being attached to the virtual world in determining self-image and popularity says Dr Samir says.
""Individuals who need to hide behind anonymity typically themselves have low levels of self-esteem, and therefore thrive in using such applications, thereby increasing the potential risk of cyberbullying,"" he says.
He adds, ""There shouldn't be a need for an application run on the basis of anonymity, and instead we need to encourage patterns of open communication systems in order to foster healthy and harmonious interpersonal spaces.
Pointing out that the virtual world allows a person to act freely and perform things that they cannot in the real life, Dr Rahul says, ""This is what the Blue Whale Challenge capitalises on. The virtual world does not pose any restrictions which gives them an adrenaline boost, particularly to teens and young adults. Youngsters take such risks because they are vulnerable and seek validation from peers in any form. Such apps make them feel as if they are a part of something big and larger than life. And for them, this virtual and imaginary world serves the purpose.""
""Prohibiting such applications is not a practical solution, as it is likely to increase the youth's curiosity towards what is forbidden,"" Dr Samir concludes.
SIGNS TO WATCH OUT FOR
Adverse impact on interpersonal relationships.
Deterioration of cognitive processes due to excessive reliance on technology. People tend to get obsessive about technology, and may lose cognisance of other aspects of their lives.
High stress levels due to increased accessibility.
Work-life imbalance.
Unhealthy lifestyle pattern.
A constant need to check other people's status.
Feeling uneasy while not connected to the internet.
A constant desire to post everything you do on social media.
Loss of interest in other activities.
Irregular or disturbed sleep.
Perpetual anxiety.
Being unable to relax properly."
26,India Today's investigation decodes Hyderabad's drug network,[],2017-07-26 20:21:28,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201707/druga-stry-647_072617080803_0.jpg,"For 23-year-old Sameer ( name changed ) getting drugs in Hyderabad five years ago was difficult. But, now it's the easiest. Though, he has come out of addiction, he says that the present day pearl city is a hub of drugs. The recent drug bust by Excise Department not only has shown the role of Telugu stars, but also the involvement of students and IT professionals.
India Today's investigation decodes the drug network in Hyderabad, and also the role of some celebrities.
What started off as a normal drug bust in Hyderabad has turned into high profile network in which major Telugu film industry celebrities are caught. So far, Excise Department has arrested fifteen persons in connection with possession of LSD, cocaine and various of other psychotrophic drugs. Following Telugu film celebrities have come under scanner: Director, Puri Jagannath, actors Charmee Kaur, Mumaith Khan , Navdeep, Tarun , Subburaju, Ravi Teja and other celebrities like Chinna alias Nowpada Dharma Rao, Shyam K Naidu, Srinivas Rao, Thanish and Nandu.
In the first week of July, Excise Department of Telangana government busted a drug racket of purchasing LSD and few other drugs through dark web. Police found the shocking network. They went undercover to various pubs to find the dealers and so far have made nineteen arrests including the man kingpin Calvin Maskerenhas and former NASA scientist Anish Kumar Dundor. Calvin had allegedly dropped the names of the celebrities and also phone records showed the same. Excise Commissioner Akun Sabhrewal told India Today, ""We started off in a small way where we came across school students using drugs. Then it started becoming big.""
HOW THE DRUG NETWORK OPERATES
India Today decided to check how this drug network operates in Hyderabad.
First visit was to Kismet, a popular pub in Hyderabad. We met an event manager who was stung. He initially denied selling drugs. But, eventually agreed that it can be brought inside the hotel through some friends. This despite the clear instructions that drug sale is banned. The event manager introduced us to a B-Tech girl and an IT professional, who said the drugs can be brought from outside and supplied in hotels. ""We can easily bring them in stealthily,"" said the event manager to India Today. The Excise Department had seized more than 3000 units of LSD in Hyderabad which is seen as a big danger.
India Today met a girl working in a pub who said her friend will purchase LSD. She called the agent before us. ""Please get LSD for a friend. Wait on the road. She has cash and will pay,"" she told her friend in our sting. But in the last minute, the peddler didn't turn up at the location we mentioned. The drug peddlers target a city. Get friendly with the pub or bar staff who introduce them to high profile clients including the actors.
India Today spoke to celebrity and party manager who spilled the beans on promise of anonymity.
""It's very easy to enjoy. The rich kids who wants to go into drugs. They want a separate world and It starts with alcohol. LSD and ganja, weed and lot more things available in Hyderabad. They target crowded places like bars, schools and college. Drug dealers want to make good money. Everybody wants to make money. That operation is serious. The film stars are always in party mode. The drugs guys search them and show the things and whoever interested will take. Not all but some people will take. They take drugs. ""
When we persisted on knowing the names of the celebrities, he claimed, ""Navdeep, Ravi Teja's driver, Charmee and some more.""
NAVDEEP CLAIMED HE IS INNOCENT
Actor Navdeep claimed that he is innocent. ""I and few friends run a night club. We organise many international shows. That's how I was introduced to an coordinator through an event manager. I had no clue he was a drug peddler. I had pure professional dealings.""
Puri Jagganadh, Mumaith Khan have also maintained that they never took drugs. But, the special investigation team is collecting the blood and hair samples of the celebrities who are being interrogated.
However, the Rs 3000 Telugu film industry which produces more than two hundred films per year is facing an image crisis.
Suresh Babu, film producer, says, ""There is a little bit of image beating for the industry and Hyderabad. The problem is some drug peddlers have given drugs. In an industry, 30,000 people working only ten or fifteen could be using. I want to be in a city which is safe. If anyone who has been using as society it's our duty we have to get them out of the system. Unfortunately, whole thing has become sensational."" Though, Rana Daggupati's name was not in the list, there were suspicions he is part of the network.
Suresh Babu, producer and Rana Daguppati's father, said, ""Since, I spoke up for the industry, they said I was protecting my son. But, when I am concerned about the others children won't I take care of mine.""
BIG SHARKS ARE SPARED
Meanwhile, Rajya Lakshmi, mother of Ravi Teja, alleged that big people are spared. ""They are only targeting us. Big sharks could be there."" The drugs are a threat to students of Hyderabad where twenty six schools and twenty seven colleges have come under scanner.
Students usually start off with hookah. Recently, Telangana government banned hookahs in bars and restaurants. But, India Today visited a restaurant social which is now called Hyderabad 12. Initially they said only food will be served. But, eventually we were able to find that Hookah pot is available for Rs 1000. A waiter said, ""We hide it when police come for checks. It's become very stringent now. But still we supply as many want it.""
While hookah business is roaring, just five hundred meters away from a police station in Dhoolpet market there was a roaring business of Marijuana. We were taken into a small street where a peddler gave us few grams of grass for just Rs 200.
""Some VIP's children come in closed car and take it. Police don't mind,"" said the peddler. This has precisely been the problem of the crackdown. Sameer who is now out of addiction shared, ""I was caught with a small quantity of grass in Hyderabad. But I was able to come out after paying some money. Some of my friends who were caught at the big level spent more money through their parents,"" he alleged.
MOST DANGEROUS TREND
The most dangerous trend now is how students and IT professionals are able to access drugs through dark web. It's just a click away to get inside a dark web where there are many markets to pay through crypto currency.
He also narrated his tough journey to come out of the drugs. Zaki Qureshi, CEO of E2 solutions, Anti Hacking Academy said, ""The unfortunate is schools targeted. Popular schools which are targetted. Parents should not give the money.""
Sameer narrated his tough journey out of drugs. ""Initially, didn't want to try. I was afraid of getting into drug. But eventually i started using as all of them appeared normal. They were sober. So I started observing all these and decided to try it. And I started doing it, but didnt realise what i did first time it was euphoric and then i didnt stop. I did half dose of LSD. I consumed at 9 pm. It took 45 minutes to sink. Then for 9 hours, I went through a different a world. I was on high. But, moments where I was disoriented. I had hallucinating about past and future. The impact it had on me was suffered. I suffered a lot. Lost my appetite. I couldn't tolerate.""
He then went on to explain how the drug operators are able to get away from the noose. ""Mostly it is T guys. They make investment in drugs and bulk and you get it in good amount. Then they cash in on that. It's all about it for me. They get in paper you can hide it in book. You can also hide in container when it comes in powder. Even, if they get caught. They have a contingency plan. If someone gets through courier LSD. He is in the limelight by cops. If he gets the information he will send courier and it will be empty. He will play blind. First is to get away from the trouble,"" he explained.
Some also say that Hyderabad has turned into a drug hub only in the last few years as the Telangana government gave a push to build the night life image of the state by promoting international band which came in with drugs.
""I have seen bands like sensation and few others coming down here. There are stalls for drugs,"" explained Lalitha Anandh, an activist.
Actor Navdeep also said that TRS government is for getting a nice night life image for the city. The concerts happening the government gave permission till 2 am. Why can't our city be a good night life.
For now, the government is conducting many campaigns in Hyderabad to bring awareness to the students , teachers and parents. Also they are trying to keep a close vigil on bars.

27,Delhi cop suspended for masturbating in front of female colleague,[],2017-07-26 11:04:55,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201707/delhi-police-for-story_647_072617092241.jpg,"Bad cops don't get much worse than this. A 33-year-old Delhi Police constable has been suspended for touching two female constables inappropriately in an inebriated state and also stripping and masturbating in front of another female colleague minutes later.
The incident took place at southwest Delhi's police training camp on Saturday evening.
Since 2014, two city police personnel have been suspended - on average - by the department every day for a variety of reasons, including misconduct, corruption, involvement in crime and indiscipline.
Speaking to this reporter, senior police officials requesting anonymity said, ""In almost 10 per cent of the cases, the cops are suspended for misconduct on duty that includes misbehaviour with senior officers and inappropriate conduct with female staff or complainants.""
DRUNK CONSTABLE MISBEHAVES
In the most recent incident, a constable in a drunken state went to two female constables hailing from Manipur at a dinner table of the mess in the Police Training College, Jharoda Kalan. He touched them inappropriately and when they objected, the constable apologised.
An hour later, he consumed more alcohol and climbed the terrace. He stripped in front of another female cop and masturbated. Senior police officials at the camp said the man has been suspended and a departmental inquiry has been ordered.
Delhi Police data in possession of MAIL TODAY shows that since January 2014 to July 10, 2017, as many as 2,026 personnel have been suspended by the vigilance department of the force.
This year, till July 10, as many as 294 policemen were suspended while four were terminated from duty.
The 294 cops include an assistant commissioner of police, five inspectors, 45 sub-inspectors, 65 assistant sub-nspectors, 62 head constables and 116 constables. Those whose services have been terminated include one sub-nspector and three constables.
294 COPS SUSPENDED, 75 BOOKED UNDER PCA
The statistics also reveal that this year, out of 294 cops who were suspended, 75 were booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act.
Among them were six inspectors, six assistant sub-inspectors, 22 head constables and 39 constables. Of these 75 corrupt cops, 69 were suspended while six were dismissed.
On July 13, two police personnel, including a sub-inspector, were arrested after the vigilance unit caught them taking a bribe of Rs 5,000 from an accused in a sexual harassment case inside the Hauz Qazi Himmatgarh police post in the central district.
Also, five traffic policemen were suspended on Thursday after they were found taking kickbacks from truck drivers.
In May, three policemen - one assistant sub-inspector and two constables - were suspended and sent to the district lines followed by a departmental inquiry after a businessman alleged that he was beaten up by them in Rohini.
In January, five cops, including the station house officer of the Adarsh Nagar police station in northwest Delhi, were suspended and booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder in connection with the case of an alleged custodial death of a suspect in a theft case. The person died after falling off the fourth floor of the police station.
80,000 COMPLAINTS ON ANTI-CORRUPTION HELPLINE
This year, more than 80,000 complaints have been made against policemen on the anti-corruption helpline so far, compared to 1.09 lakh last year.
The data also shows that as many as 588 cops were suspended in 2014. The figure was 542 the next year and 602 in 2016. Delhi Police has around 85,000 personnel.
""In most of the cases, apart from misconduct the other reasons leading to the suspension of cops are habitual absence from duty, indiscipline especially in court monitoring. Serious charges against the cops include bad or inappropriate behaviour, involvement in crime, corruption, negligence in law and order situation or inaction in a case,"" said Madhur Verma, deputy commissioner of police (crime branch).
Verma is also the spokesperson of Delhi Police. In January, the SHO of Mangolpuri police station was sent to the district police lines for allegedly turning up late for a hearing at the Delhi High Court.
Another senior officer explained that in the committee review meeting, that takes place every month, the action or the time frame is decided. If the charges are serious and sensitive, a departmental enquiry is ordered and major action is taken, which could include termination -either removal or dismissal from duty. If the cop is removed from the services, he or she can join any other government job. But a person dismissed does not get that opportunity. Delhi Police have around 85,000 personnel.

28,Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison: The war of currents and the search for truth,[],2017-07-10 17:12:51,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201707/nikola-tesla-and-thomas-edison-647_071017042108.jpg,"Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison are two giants of electrical engineering whose inventions changed history. But the electricity between the two is no secret to the world.
Nikola Tesla contributed to the development of the alternating-current (AC) electrical system which is widely used today and to the rotating magnetic field, which is the basis of most AC machinery.
Born on July 10, 1856, Nikola Tesla went to the United States in 1884 and briefly worked with Thomas Edison before the two parted ways.
Edison, the iconic inventor of the light bulb, the phonograph and the moving picture and Tesla, whose inventions have enabled modern-day power and mass communication systems, waged a 'War of Currents' in the 1880s over whose electrical system would power the world. Edison's direct-current (DC) electric power or Tesla's alternating-current (AC) system.
A brief history of Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison
In 1884 Tesla arrived in the United States with little other than the clothes on him and a letter of introduction to the famed inventor and business tycoon Thomas Edison. Edison's DC-electrical works were fast becoming the country standard. Edison hired Tesla and the two were soon working vigorously alongside each other, making improvements in Edison's inventions.
However, several months later, Tesla and Edison parted ways because of a conflicting business-scientific relationship, which historians attributed to their incredibly different personalities. While Edison was a power figure who focused on marketing and financial success, Tesla was not business minded and was somewhat vulnerable.
After parting ways with Edison in 1885, Tesla received funding for the Tesla Electric Light Company. His task, as given by his investors, was to develop improved arc lighting. After successful completion of the project, Tesla was forced out of venture and for a time had to work as a manual labourer in order to survive.
His luck changed in 1887 when he gained public interest in his AC electrical system and funding for his new Tesla Electric Company. By the end of the year Tesla had successfully filed several patents for his AC-based inventions.
Here's how the two rivalling inventors stack up:
1. Brilliance
Tesla had an eidetic memory. He could very precisely recall images and objects, which enabled him to accurately visualize intricate 3D objects and therefore, he could build working prototypes using few preliminary drawings.
In contrast, Edison was more of a sketcher and a repairer.
In the end, Edison held 1,093 patents and Tesla held less than 300 worldwide. Of course, Edison had a bunch of assistants helping him devise inventions, and had also bought some of this patents.
2. Forward thinking
Edison had dispelled Tesla's AC system of electric power transmission, calling it 'impractical', instead promoting his simpler yet less efficient DC system.
By contrast, Tesla's ideas were often more disorderly technologies that didn't have existing market demand. His alternating-current motor and hydroelectric plant at Niagara Falls- a first of its kind plant- truly electrified the world.
Tesla spent years working on a system that could wirelessly transmit voices, images and moving pictures. His ideas made him futurist. He later invented and patented Tesla Coil, which is till date used in radio, telephones, cell phones and television.
3. Impact
Edison's enduring legacy is a result of his invention factories where tasks and inventions were carried out by legions of workers. After getting an idea, Edison would leave most of the experimentation on his assistants. By having multiple patents and inventions developing in parallel, Edison ensured a consistent, hefty financial supply to his assistants to continue running experiments and fleshing out more designs.
Tesla's inventions are the backbone of modern power and communication systems, but he faded into anonymity later in the 20th century. Despite his many inventions and patents, he died an eccentric, destitute man in 1943.
Later life
Tesla's AC systems eventually caught the attention of American engineer and businessman George Westinghouse, who was looking for a solution to supply the nation with long-distance power. Convinced that Tesla's inventions will help him achieve this, he purchased his patents for 60,000 USD in cash and stock in the Westinghouse Corporation in 1888.
As the public interest in alternating current system grew, Tesla and Westinghouse stood in direct competition with Thomas Edison, who was intent on selling his direct-current system to the nation.
Edison also launched a negative press-campaign in an attempt to undermine the interest in AC power. All this while, Tesla continued his work and patented several more inventions during this period, including the 'Tesla Coil', which laid the foundation for wireless technology that is still in use in radio technology today.
Unfortunately for Edison, the Westinghouse Corporation was chosen to supply the lighting at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and Tesla conducted demonstrations of his AC system there. Two years later, in 1895, Tesla designed one of the first AC hydroelectric power plants in the United States at Niagara Falls. The next year, it was used to power the city of Buffalo, New York. This feat was widely publicized throughout the world.
With its repeated success and favourable press, the alternating-current system became the leading power system of the 20th century and it has remained the worldwide standard since.
The disgraceful fall
Tesla became obsessed with the wireless transmission of energy. In around 1900, he started work on his boldest project, to build a global, wireless communication system to be transmitted through a large electrical tower for sharing information and providing free electricity throughout the world.
With funding from a group of investors that included financial giant J. P. Morgan, in 1901 Tesla began work on the project in earnest, designing and building a lab with a power plant and a massive transmission tower on a site on Long Island, New York, that became known as Wardenclyffe.
However, investors started doubting the plausibility of Tesla's system his rival, Guglielmo Marconi-with the financial support of Andrew Carnegie and Thomas Edison-continued to make great advances with his own radio technologies, Tesla had no choice but to abandon the project.
Wardenclyffe Wardenclyffe
The Wardenclyffe staff was laid off in 1906 and in 1915 the site fell into foreclosure. Two years later Tesla declared bankruptcy and the tower was dismantled and sold for scrap to recover the debts he had accrued.
Death and legacy
Tesla suffered a nervous breakdown and eventually returned to work as a consultant primarily. But as time passed, his ideas progressively became more unusual and impractical. He also grew increasingly eccentric and devoted much of his time in caring for wold pigeons in New York City's parks.
He even drew FBI's attention for his talk of building a powerful ""death beam"", which had also received some interest from the Soviet Union during World War II.

29,"Aaj ka sawaal: While PM Modi is in Israel, where is Mr Kejriwal?",[],2017-07-05 20:00:25,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201707/arvind-kejriwal_647_070517074555_0.jpg,"Amidst the hectic political activities happening in the country and abroad, one person missing from action is Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener, who usually comments on all the crucial national issues and attacks Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the ruling BJP, of late is conspicuous by his absence.
These days Kejriwal is not seen even on television channels giving sound bytes. Advertisements featuring him on TVs and radio channels have also done a vanishing act.
At least three significant developments have taken place in the last one month. The presidential and vice presidential elections have been announced, historic economic reform in the form of Goods and Services Tax (GST) has been implemented and Narendra Modi became the first prime minister in about 70 years of India's independence to embark upon a three-day visit to Israel.
But the Delhi CM appears to be aloof from all these developments. His comments on mainstream and social media are hard to find. Otherwise, Kejriwal used to be at the forefront in criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his government and BJP on most of the issues.
KEJRIWAL HAS NO LOCUS STANDI ON ISRAEL ISSUE: SOURCES
Reacting on these three recent developments, sources close to Kejriwal told India Today that the Delhi CM does not have any locus standi on the Israel issue. Reminded that other opposition leaders were giving their opinion on it, they were of the view that Kejriwal had not been forthcoming on foreign matters.
On GST, they said Kejriwal had taken part in a hangout on July 2 over the issue and also the alleged lynching over beef of Junaid a day before Eid. They said he had also ""retweeted"" some comments. On the presidential elections, they said the party had hinted that they would not support the candidature of BJP's candidate Ram Nath Kovind.
However, in the past, the Delhi CM used to take an unequivocal stand on issues and would aggressively put forth his point of view.
When the whole nation was celebrating over India launching surgical strikes against terrorists on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on September 29, 2016, Kejriwal was among the few opposition leaders who had doubted the military exercise. The Delhi CM had demanded that the Centre provide proofs of the surgical strikes. While doing so, he faced criticism in the country but was quoted extensively in Pakistan.
KEJRIWAL CRITICAL OF DEMONETISATION
Similarly, when PM Modi announced the demonetisation initiative at 8 pm on November 8, 2016, most of the people went euphoric. The move was hailed by most sections of society. But Kejriwal along with his West Bengal counterpart Mamata Banerjee led a campaign to demand a rollback of demonetisation. He even threatened PM Modi of ""revolt"" from the masses if 'notebandi' was not withdrawn.
But not any longer. Kejriwal has refrained from appearing on the national scene regarding any significant matter. He has confined himself to the national capital, attending to local issues.

He has hardly been even posting original tweets. On almost all occasions, he is found retweeting posts. Interestingly, a large number of his retweets belong to an anonymous person called AAP Ka Mehta with the Twitter handle @DaaruBaazMehta. Translated into English, the handle means 'alcoholic Mehta'.
Sample a couple of such retweets:

One would wonder why a politician like Kejriwal has suddenly started maintaining a low profile. These could be the seven reasons behind the Delhi CM taking a backseat:
1. DEFEAT IN ASSEMBLY POLLS
Kejriwal was almost sure of winning the Assembly elections in Punjab and Goa held earlier this year. The drubbing in Punjab and the failure to open any account in Goa was embarrassing for the Delhi CM. His prestige was at stake in both these states because of the time and resources invested there. But a loss in both these states in his very attempt to expand AAP's base beyond the national capital proved a damp squib.
2. LOSS IN MCD ELECTIONS
It was AAP's first election for controlling the three bodies of Municipal Corporation of Delhi. However, the party ruling in Delhi lost to BJP. This was no less a jolt than the defeat in Punjab and Goa Assembly elections because AAP is the ruling party here.
3. EMBARRASSMENT OVER EVM
After the defeat in the two Assembly elections, Kejriwal alleged that the EVMs were tampered with to defeat AAP. He alleged that the EVMs were rigged to favour BJP in Uttar Pradesh and Goa and Congress in Punjab. He accused the Election Commission (EC) of playing into the hands of the Centre. He demanded that the EC hand over one EVM to AAP for 72 hours and it would prove that the software could be tampered with.
EC accepted the challenge and invited not just AAP but all political parties to try their luck in proving that EVMs could be rigged. However, the parties, including AAP, backed out. This was again a loss of face for Kejriwal.
4. INTERNAL WRANGLINGS
AAP has been beset with internal strife, particularly after the electoral defeats. Former Delhi minister Kapil Mishra has revolted against Kejriwal, levelling serious allegations of financial irregularities and improprieties against his chief minister.
Around the same time, AAP co-founder and Kejriwal's confidante Kumar Vishwas have fallen apart. The two were seen trying to harm each other's political interests. A truce was sought to be brought about but it does not seem to be a permanent one. These have bogged Kejriwal down.
5. DEFAMATION CASES
The defamation cases filed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley against Kejriwal and four others from AAP have weighed him down. Though the AAP convener is fighting the case and has appointed senior lawyer Ram Jethmalani to defend him, he appears to be on the defensive. Kejriwal has been seen trying to wriggle out of the case by prolonging it and buying time.
6. OFFICE OF PROFIT CASE
Besides the revolt by three AAP MLAs, the sword of disqualification is also dangling over 20 of the 66 party legislators over the office of profit case. EC has ruled that it would continue hearing in the office of profit case. It has also signalled disqualification of the 20 MLAs. The final decision may come soon. If that happens, it would be the severest jolt that Delhi's AAP government would receive so far.
The judgment may also rob AAP of the moral authority to rule Delhi. Kejriwal may be forced to resign and call for mid-term election.
7. ED, CBI CASES
Central investigative agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) are examining cases lodged against AAP leaders including Kejriwal and his ministerial colleague Satyender Jain. ED has filed a case against AAP for allegedly diverting Rs 2 crore donations. A case is also pending over financing of ""secret spy squad"".
BACK TO DELHI
Kejriwal has apologised to the people of Delhi on two counts - for resigning in 2014 in a huff after 49 days of rule and for contesting the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from a large number of seats in several states. While swearing in as CM during his second term on February 14, 2015, he had promised not to leave Delhi.
However, he forgot his promise and did the opposite by trying to expand AAP's base to Punjab and Goa. While the party lost elections in both the states, Kejriwal lost face and Delhi lost administration and governance. While he and his party leaders were busy campaigning outside Delhi, Delhi was plagued with vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue and chikungunya.
Kejriwal seems to have realised his folly. And it's back to basics now for him.

30,British women drink most while pregnant: survey,[],2017-04-12 18:15:26,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"London, Apr 12 (PTI) British women drink the most during pregnancy, despite recommendations to abstain from alcohol during this time, according to a new survey of 11 European countries.
Researchers, including those from University of Oslo in Norway, studied about 7905 women, 53 per cent of whom were pregnant, and 46 per cent were new mothers (with a child up to one-year-old).
The countries included were Croatia, Finland, France, Italy, Norway, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK.
The countries with the highest proportion of women who reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy were the UK (28.5 per cent), Russia (26.5 per cent) and Switzerland (20.9 per cent).
The women completed an anonymous online questionnaire, which was available on selected websites intended for pregnant women in the respective countries.
Researchers found on average, 16 per cent of women reported that they drank alcohol after they knew that they were pregnant.
The countries with the highest proportion of women who reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy were the UK with 28.5 per cent, Russia with 26.5 per cent and Switzerland 20.9 per cent.
The countries with the lowest proportion of women who reported alcohol consumption were Norway (4.1 per cent), Sweden (7.2 per cent) and Poland (9.7 per cent).
Women who reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy were more likely to be older, more highly educated, in employment, and had smoked before pregnancy than women who did not report this consumption, researchers said.
Of those women who said they drank alcohol during pregnancy, 39 per cent consumed at least one unit of alcohol per month.
Those who drank most frequently more than one to two units per week were in Italy (7.8 per cent of the women said they drank during pregnancy)and the UK 2.8 per cent.
Those who drank the least 1-2 units during the whole pregnancy were in Norway and Sweden (over 80 per cent of the women who said they drank during pregnancy) and France, Poland, Finland and Russia 70-80 per cent.
""Differences in pregnant womens drinking behaviour between countries can have many explanations besides variations in willingness of women to provide information about their alcohol consumption during pregnancy,"" said Hedvig Nordeng from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.
""There could be differences in national guidelines or educational campaigns about drinking during pregnancy, differences in prenatal care and attitudes towards alcohol use in pregnancy, or a combination of all these factors,"" he said.
""We can speculate that both social and cultural factors play a role. Womens attitudes on the one hand, and national alcohol-related guidelines and policies on the other, may influence womens drinking behaviour during pregnancy,"" said Angela Lupattelli from the University of Oslo.

31,"Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger says future will be decided ""in March or April""",[],2017-02-16 21:28:42,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201702/wengerfb-story_647_021617042913.jpg,"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said his future would probably be decided ""in March or April"" as he pondered whether to take up the offer of a contract extension or leave the club he has managed for 20 years at the end of the season.
The Frenchman was speaking to German television station ZDF before Arsenal's 5-1 Champions League humiliation by Bayern Munich on Wednesday, but details of the interview emerged only on Thursday as speculation intensified about Wenger's intention.
Asked when he would decide whether to continue next season, he said: ""March, April probably."" Separately, the BBC reported, without sources, on Thursday that his future would be determined at the end of the season, when his existing deal expires.
The 67-year-old Frenchman was stunned almost into silence after Wednesday's game, answering just three questions in a press conference that lasted under three minutes.
Wenger is due to speak publicly again on Friday, by which time he will have had time not only to digest the 5-1 defeat but also the hostile reaction from pundits and former Arsenal players who lined up to predict his demise when his contract expires this summer.
Such is Wenger's standing at the club, he will effectively decide his own fate.
British media reported that a new two-year deal had been offered but Arsenal legends Lee Dixon, Ian Wright and Bob Wilson all said they felt Wenger might decide to walk away.
""I doubt he will sleep very much between now and a horrible (FA Cup) game on an artificial pitch at Sutton on Monday night,"" said Wilson. ""He might say enough is enough.""
Critics were quick to point out that Wenger's explanation for the Munich mauling -- that his players were ""jaded and lacking organisation"" -- reflected his own managerial shortcomings, and almost mirrored his remarks the last time his side were thumped, also 5-1, by the same opponents 18 months earlier.
The only support seemed to come from Bayern manager Carlo Ancelotti. ""This is football,"" he said. ""I think Arsene has a lot of experience, the experience to manage this moment, this result and look forward to the next game. It's only one game.""
The trouble is, it isn't.
Six successive eliminations at the same stage of the knockout phase do not suggest coincidence and a tactically disjointed Arsenal side were well beaten by opponents below their best.
Arsenal's two biggest stars Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil, underperformed in wildly contrasting fashion and did little to suggest either is worth the enhanced new contracts they seek.
While Ozil was anonymous, confirming the critical view that he goes missing in the big games, Sanchez got visibly agitated in chasing the ball, often on his own.
NON-LEAGUE CHALLENGE
It was unclear whether his solo defiance accorded to a game plan that he had just invented, or one put in place by Wenger which his team mates were ignoring. Either way, it did not reflect well on the manager at the heart of it all.
Wenger's next challenge could not be more different -- an FA Cup tie next Monday on a 3G pitch at non-league Sutton United.
Once again, the cameras will be there to track Wenger's every move on live TV, with acres of newsprint likely to be devoted to whether the clock is really ticking on his 20 years at the club.
There is, of course, no right way for a long-standing manager to quit. Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest were relegated in his last season, when his battle with alcoholism became increasingly obvious. Clough was 58 but never managed again.
A better template was offered by Sir Alex Ferguson, who retracted his first retirement announcement in 2001 before eventually leaving Manchester United at the age of 71 after winning the title for the 13th time, in 2013.
But with Arsenal already 10 points behind leaders Chelsea, and with a tricky game at Liverpool next up, Wenger knows a fourth title on his watch is unlikely.
So, with no side ever coming back from such a first-leg Champions League deficit, the best he can probably hope for is a top-four finish and an FA Cup win, precisely the same as they managed in 2014 and 2015.
Whether the fans will view that as progress remains to be seen."

According to sources, the peon, Manoj Kumar, who works at CBSE office at ITO, was caught by the guard posted at the office for trying to steal the papers.
More on the report:
As per senior police officer's statements, the incident took place on January 22
The guard, Mohan Sing was the first to spot the peon with the papers
As reported in recent Indian Express report, police are yet to ascertain the motive, and are trying to establish if Kumar was a part of a larger racket.
Police charges filed against the peon:
Case has been registered at Madhu Vihar police station under IPC sections 380 (theft)
411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property)
454 (trespassing)
323 (voluntary causing hurt)
Furthermore, police reports suggested that Kumar was under the influence of alcohol.
While commenting on the whole issue, a CBSE official, requesting anonymity, said there was a need to remain vigilant, especially with board exams approaching.
""This is a serious issue and we have suspended the peon. We have formed a committee to look into the matter. We are also inquiring if he was hand-in-glove with someone else,"" added the official.

Freedom fighters of Agra have also opened up a front against Modi on this issue and demanded that Modi should issue a personal apology on this gaffe and the KVIC recall the calendars and diaries that have Modi's image spinning charkha printed on them. They have warned that the freedom fighters of Agra will hold a protest at the Parliament if the Modi government did not make amends immediately.
Gandhian thinker and freedom fighter, Chiman Lal Jain, who has been running an anti-alcohol movement in Agra since the past 4 years, said that this was a major error of judgment by the Modi government and all Gandhians should protest the printing of these calendars and diaries in which Modi has replaced Gandhi on the cover. He said that Mahatma Gandhi is the Father of the Nation and nobody has the stature to replace him.
Freedom fighter late Gopal Shiromani's entire family joined the Gandhian movement from the beginning and adopted khadi as their choice of clothing. Gopal Shiromani's son and social activist Shashi Shiromani said that if someone desires to replace Gandhi, it is his misconception as Mahatma Gandhi's personality is above ordinary humans and politicians. Gandhi's leadership enabled India to shrug off the chains of British slavery, whereas Modi's leadership has made the people slaves of banks.
Freedom fighter Rani Saroj Gaurihar said that by replacing Mahatma Gandhi's image with his image, Modi has made a major blunder as Gandhi cannot be replaced.
Senior Congress leader Haji Jameeluddin said that India does not belong to either Modi or any other person. 130 crore Indians have their right on this country and Gandhi resides in the hearts of every Indian citizen. Modi should apologize to the entire country for this mistake and realise that his dictatorial policies won't last very long.
Retired IAS and Adarsh Party President Dr Chandrapal told India Today that Modi has dug his own grave with this blunder. He said that ""It appears that in the coming time, Modi may also attempt to replace Gandhi on the currency notes with his picture. First demonetisation and now this replacement of Gandhi's image, these blunders could cost Modi dearly in the coming assembly elections."""
34,Delhi youth gets hooked on snake venom; doctors stunned,[],2017-01-07 08:31:42,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201701/snake-story_647_010717083123_0.jpg,"This man has a ssserious problem. After alcohol and cannabis stopped providing the required kick, 30-yearold Manoj (name changed) started to get high on snake venom. The resident of Shadipur in west Delhi is now trying to get over his addiction at the prestigious RML Hospital where doctors say his blood has turned toxic and even his spit can be fatal to others.
Gets hooked on snake venom a few months ago
Manoj, who is a drummer by profession, took to drugs in his early teens and got hooked on snake venom a few months ago. ""All my friends use opium, ganja, doda (poppy husk) and heroin. I was consuming all kinds of drugs available in the market and when they stopped having any effect on me, I decided to try snake venom. It keeps me high for at least 24-30 hours,"" Manoj told Mail Today. Peddlers provide the venom in tiny packets, each one priced at about Rs 3,000-Rs 4,000.

Delhi doctors stunned
Dr Smita Deshpande, who heads the department of psychiatry and de-addiction at RML hospital, told Mail Today, ""This is for the first time that we have seen a patient here admitted for drug rehabilitation who has confessed to consuming dangerous snake venom to get high. Such cases are very rare and patients too do not easily reveal what kind of drugs they are taking.""
Experts say
Experts say certain types of addicts share some personality traits and seem to have been born with high-levels of impulsiveness and thrill-seeking- behaviour that is common in poly-substance users or abusers. Such people occasionally get snakebites or venom for their euphoric effect.
Manoj was brought to the hospital by family members after he started to threaten them for money to get his fix.
""I have only recently started consuming snake venom orally, but some of my friends get snakebites for maximum high,"" said Manoj. ""The serpent bites when it is pressed gently. The bite is administered under the tongue and its effects last for at least one week. This also depends on the species of the snake being used.""

However, he did not reveal the source from where he gets the highly expensive drug in the city.
Full- fledged racket is active in city
RML doctors say that procuring snake venom is illegal and it is very expensive, suggesting that a full- fledged racket is active in the city. There have been reports that some snake catchers trade in venom. ""If a person consumes any kind of snake venom drug, his blood too becomes toxic. Such a person cannot donate blood to anybody as it can prove fatal to the recipient,"" said Dr Lokesh Shekhawat, associate professor of psychiatry at RML Hospital.
""Today's youth is attracted by novel trends. His blood investigations showed high levels of toxicity and the presence of other available drugs. And taking snake venom can be fatal for even an addict, in high dosages.""
Person's spit too can be fatal for others
Health experts say in the initial hours of ingesting snake venom, a person's spit too can be fatal for others. The addiction can result in slow-poisoning and can kill a person in stages- it could first affect the eyes, and lead to total paralysis.
Snake venom, collected from farmed reptiles, has been used to make antisera for snakebites for decades by injecting it into mammals such as sheep and horses, and collecting the antibodies thus generated.
No diagnostic equipment to quantify level of snake venom in patient's body
Dr Shekhawat said there is no diagnostic equipment anywhere in the world to quantify the level of snake venom in Manoj's body.
Cases of people getting hooked on snakebites and venom have been reported in the past from metro cities like Mumbai and Kolkata as well as rural areas.
Dr Shipra Singh, psychiatrist and drug rehabilitation expert at RML hospital, told Mail Today she consulted in six cases reported at Grant Medical College in central Mumbai.
An expert from AIIMS, requesting anonymity, said, ""In the past 10 years, I have seen four cases like this and these are very, very rare. As snake venom contains neurotoxins and cardio-toxins, it can always prove fatal to someone who is consuming it. These patients informed me that they used to go to the jungle for a snake bite and they could easily identify the species fit for the purpose."
35,Drug in the times of demonetisation: Chocolate spiked opium is cashless city's new high,[],2016-12-12 05:23:48,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201612/opium-647_121016043347_0.jpg,"Drug suppliers in the city have doped out a way to stay afloat and keep clients on a high amid a cash crunch triggered by the government's demonetisation drive. They are mixing grains of chocolate malt drinks into opium to cut costs and provide patrons a fresh flavour with Christmas and New Year celebrations just round the corner.
Sources say a colour resemblance allows peddlers to combine the two products apart from the fact that both contain sugar and gum. They can sell it for Rs 60,000-1 lakh a kilogram. Investigation agencies in the national capital region (NCR) say this is not the first time that drug addicts are experimenting with fusion of high-end drugs and eatables. Sources say youngsters frequently want to try something new and fresh concoctions often debut near the end of the year when drug supply and consumption go up.
Also, when a new user enters the world of drugs, party organisers who are illegally supplying narcotics, facilitate them with flavoured stimulants such as cocoa cocaine, opium mixed with Chinese food and concoctions of chocolate and drugs. Government agencies say supply of drugs in large quantities has been postponed because of demonetisation as dealers and clients are short of cash.

""Now, to cope with the situation, the organisers who have ordered raw opium and other high-end drugs are likely to opt for fusion of drugs with eatables,"" sources said. ""This way the quantity of drugs will increase and the organisers will be able to satisfy more customers by advertising the drug as a fusion mix.""
Authorities say recent cases point to increasingly regular contact between smugglers and militants and investigations have outlined an extensive network that appears to range across Afghanistan, Pakistan and Kuwait. Punjab in particular has emerged as a conduit for drugs from the terror-funding opium fields of Afghanistan to markets across Asia, Europe and elsewhere.
Quoting inputs from drug dealers, suppliers and consumers, a senior officer in narcotics department on condition of anonymity said, ""Rave parties are being organised on the outskirts of the national Capital and a large number of clients have already enrolled. Special demand has been made to facilitate them with pocket-friendly drugs as they too are cashless. So, the dealers have joined hands with suppliers to introduce opium laced with chocolate.""

Rave parties, characterised by electronic-trance music, dancing and alcohol, are infamous for the rampant presence of drugs and are also called ""acid house parties"". These events have now become an essential part of celebrations, especially around New Year's Eve.
Cultivators and suppliers in rural parts too adulterate opium this way for more profits. The price of opium is around Rs 10 lakh per kilogram in the international market while in India, it is available for only Rs 1-1.5 lakh.
""Usually, to increase the weight of opium, cultivators combine it with chocolate malt drink mixes,"" said a source. ""The colour resemblance and some similar ingredients are helpful."" The concoction with 10% chocolate mix will give an addict the same kick that he gets from opium. The drug is usually smoked, but can also be eaten, added to drinks, or injected. Sources say most youngsters in India love to consume it in powder form. Drug dealers usually sell it as a powder, or as a sticky solid. Opium is usually smoked, because it hits the brain quicker."
36,Your money's worth,[],2016-12-11 16:54:20,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201612/money-life-dec19-1-647_120816122927.jpg,"Every society in between the Stone Age and the fictional future uses money. The Sentinelese, who inhabit North Sentinel Island in the Andamans, don't use money. There are also a few pre-monetary tribes in the Amazon rainforest.
A lot of science fiction, some of it excellent, considers post-monetary societies. The late Iain Banks' novels are set against the backdrop of a galaxy-spanning Culture, which is so resource-rich and so technologically advanced that money is obsolete: anything (including immortality) is available for the asking. Ursula K. Le Guin also indulged in a thought experiment about post-monetary societies when she dreamt up the anarchist, 'syndicalist' civilisation of The Dispossessed.
One way to understand why money is useful to us is to look at the idea of non-monetary 'resource-based economies' dreamt up by the Zeitgeist Movement and The Venus Project. These oddball movements were founded in the early 21st century by folks concerned about inequitable distribution of resources. In these socialist utopias, money will be abolished. All-knowing computers will track all resources. The silicon commissars will figure out what every individual needs, and allocate food, energy, healthcare, etc. in equitable, environmentally sustainable ways. What happens in such a hypothetical society if, for example, a chap who doesn't like chocolate is allocated 100 grams of chocolate per day? Can he trade that chocolate for extra massages (he is only allocated one massage per month)?
He can do so directly only if the masseur wants chocolate and the two figure out a mutually agreeable rate of exchange of massages for chocolates. If the masseur wants a bicycle instead, the computers must figure out how to equate chocolate with massages and bicycles. This is easy: just price all three, using money.
But, then, why not use money anyhow? People use money because bartering goods (bicycles=chocolates) is cumbersome, and bartering services (I fix your computer, you look after my health) more so. Bartering goods for services (chocolates=massages) is a nightmare.
In fact, barter is impossible in a modern, industrialised society with zillions of goods and services. A car has over 30,000 parts. An oncologist spends seven years learning her specialisation. A civil engineer spends five years learning his. If the doctor is incompetent, a patient dies; if the civil engineer is incompetent, a bridge may collapse, killing hundreds. How do you compare the value of these two services versus that of the pizza delivery boy, or the popular musician, or the porn star? Use money.
Money used to be backed by things, ranging from useless bling (gold, precious stones) to useful (arrowheads, bronze ingots, salt, rice). Indian coastal kingdoms used cowrie shells, which is why several Indian languages use 'cowrie' as a colloquialism for small coin. 'Salary' is derived from the Latin for salt. Japan used gold and silver coins, anchored to koku-the average daily rice consumption of an adult. The Finns and Russians used fur pelts.
Gold became the international standard and enabled cross-border trade. Coins from different nations could be compared in weight and purity. The preferred currency of the Mughals was silver. Babar's standard coin (the Shahrukh) contained just under 5 grams of silver. The US dollar was briefly bi-metallic and, therefore, linked to the price of both silver and gold.
The concept of scrip or banknotes became popular as paper technology improved. Paper is easy to carry. If that paper has a promise or a guarantee that it can be exchanged for gold (or silver, or whatever backs the currency), it is even more useful than metal itself. It didn't have to be a sovereign state issuing a promissory note-a merchant whose credit was good could do so. The temptation to print more paper than there was gold in the vaults was high. It also soon became apparent that it didn't really matter if gold and paper didn't match. Nobody actually exchanges paper for gold; they exchange paper for goods and services.
Say, a 16th century monarch had 10 kg of gold. Well, he could print a thousand notes, each backed by 10 grams. Or he could print 10,000 such notes-after all, who was counting the gold in the vaults? If somebody wanted to exchange paper, that person could be fobbed off with more paper. The concept of seigniorage emerged. If it costs, say, 1 rupee to print a note with a face value of Rs 500, well, the state has 499 extra rupees, just like that. Printing paper and putting it out enables such tricks that can help further trade.
Sometimes inflation happened because there was too much money in circulation and people didn't trust the issuer. Sometimes there was deflation. But that was true even if metal supplies increased or fell, for every gold rush caused a dip in currency values. India had a complicated relationship with metals during British rule. The rupee was backed by silver. The sterling was backed by gold. The one rupee coin contained about a tola (11 grams) of silver till the 1930s. The relationship between gold and silver affected the sterling and the rupee.
World War I, its aftermath, and World War II destroyed the concept of backing currencies. There was hyper-inflation after World War I. Then there was a global depression. Most nations abandoned metal standards and currencies became pure fiat, not backed by anything except trust in the state issuing it. The US dollar remained backed by gold (except for a brief period in 1933-34). That was an anchor since every currency, including the rouble, had an official exchange rate with the US dollar. In 1971, Richard Nixon dropped the gold standard and every major currency became pure fiat.
Gold is next to useless anyhow, except as a store of value since we think it's valuable. Money's utility is mostly as a medium of exchange. Money allows strangers to transact without the need to trust each other; they trust currency instead.
The next logical step: why bother to carry physical currency? The cash can be stored in the bank as electronic entries. So long as those electronic bytes can be transferred and converted to cash at need, it doesn't really matter, does it? Strangers can still transact, using cheques, credit cards, mobile transfers, etc. And banks can lend bytes out and boost business and give depositors returns.
Ah, but there's a rub to cashless transactions. Anonymity disappears. Every transaction is logged with an electronic audit trail. There are also charges for cheques and credit cards that make micro transactions inconvenient. So let's say, you go to the monthly meeting of the Delhi Atheists & Rationalists and enjoy a rare steak with a nice bottle of red wine. If you pay for it by swiping a card, some officious busybody, or your vegetarian uncle who prays every day and disapproves of your godlessness, might come around to scream at you. Or, you are sleeping with some random body and you book a hotel room with the card. Well, there could be hell to pay if somebody's significant other gets a look at the card statement.
Or, imagine you're a woman who wants to squirrel away some money escaping the eyes of rapacious in-laws and an alcoholic, abusive husband. You can't do this by putting the money in the bank. You can hide cash. You cannot hide a bank account.
Most tellingly, trust in state and policy consistency must be high if you're going to keep your money dematerialised. You must believe that the state will not suddenly act in arbitrary fashion to freeze your account, or simply expropriate everything. If the said state withdraws 86 per cent of the currency, issues 180 notifications in 20 days and passes a new IT Bill inside five minutes with no debate, it is hard to trust it.
Consider how convenient a cashless system is for the state. It will take 50 days (at least) to freeze and withdraw physical cash from circulation after issuing a fatwa. But a fatwa could freeze any or every bank account in 10 minutes. Or, the government could expropriate whatever it wanted, as easily and instantly as it transfers gas cylinder subsidies. Or, a hacker might clean out your account.
There are ways to transact anonymously, electronically, using crypto-currencies like bitcoin. But that requires a fair degree of tech competence, decent internet connections, and a counterparty who is equally comfortable. India has no data protection or privacy laws and the need for passing such legislation has not been acknowledged by anybody in power. Essentially, if the state wants information on your electronic transactions, it can gather it instantly without seeking the permission of any court. It can also cheerfully release it into the public domain, just to embarrass you.
It's way easier and way safer to use paper. Cash doesn't require an internet connection. It doesn't carry extra charges. It is acceptable to all. It can be kept under a mattress rather than in a bank account visible to shiftless spouse and grasping mother-in-law. Above all, cash offers protection against state surveillance and expropriation, and against hacking.
Japan, which is one of the world's most law-abiding and prosperous nations, has more currency in circulation (18 per cent of GDP) than India (13 per cent cash to GDP ratio). Germany, another law-abiding and prosperous nation, does over 80 per cent of its transactions in cash.
The science-fictional future where India goes cashless may be worse than the one outlined in 1984. Winston Smith used cash for his transactions. Bunty Khanna wouldn't be allowed to.

Reportedly, the women committed the above-mentioned 'crime' two years ago when she attended a party in the Iranian city of Mashhad.
Alinejad's Facebook post--that is a part of her #NoToLashes social media movement--describes the incident in detail and mentions how after initially being arrested for consuming alcohol, the woman in question was asked to strip and subsequently, whipped 80 times in a row.

""I will never forget the moment when the security forces stormed the house. Without even showing us any warrant, they raced into the house and they were all males. We were first [forcibly] taken to the police station in the neighbourhood. Afterwards, they took us to a clinic to test how much alcohol we had consumed. Then, we were driven off to a horrid place run by female officers where their treatment of us was actually worse than how males were treated,"" the post has the woman as saying.

39,"Shocking: Cops openly flout forensic norms, delay of over 10 days in sending samples to labs",[],2016-11-08 15:29:34,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201610/forensic-labs647_103016031012_0.jpg,"Out of 466 biological samples and 380 chemical samples collected since January this year, few police stations took more than 100 days in sending the forensic samples to the labs.
There is a delay of more than 10 days in sending biological and chemical evidence to forensic laboratories against the standard operating procedure which mentions that it has to be 'within a reasonable' time that is usually considered to be between 48-72 hours, according to the findings of Delhi State Legal Service Authority (DSLSA).
The Delhi High Court is hearing a public interest litigation on various aspects of the working of the criminal justice delivery system.
On the directions of Delhi High Court, Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA) inspected 22 police stations in 11 districts to gauge the ground reality of the evidence locker (mal khanas) where the biological and chemical samples are stored before they are sent to the forensic labs after the Delhi Police filed an affidavit on the procedure it adopts for the storage of samples.
SURVEY REVEALS THE TRUTH: OVER 100 DAYS TO SEND THE SAMPLES TO LABS
According to the survey, out of 466 biological samples and 380 chemical samples collected since January 2016, the delay of more than 10 days was found in 48.88 per cent and 64.30 per cent, respectively.
There were police stations that took more than 100 days in sending the samples to the labs.
Biological samples include blood, blood stain, semen, semen stain, saliva, urine, sweat, faecal material among others. The chemical samples include those used in crimes such as bride burning, arson and fire, acid attacks, poisoning, drug abuse, alcoholism, etc. Out of 22 police stations, four of them had not stored in biological samples in minus four degrees Celsius.
In Shakarpur police station only one biological sample out of 23 samples were stored at the required temperature.
Dharmesh Sharma, additional sessions judge and member secretary of DSLSA told Mail Today ""The biological and chemical samples have different life. The SOP says it has to be sent 'within reasonable time.' Which is why the inspection team decided to see the cases where there is a delay of more than 10 days. In poisoning cases, chemicals are such that they react and give diluted results. Which is why the best time to send the same is 48-72 hours and there are several judgments to support this,"" he said.
Speaking to Mail Today, a police official requesting anonymity, also claimed that the FSLs do not accept the samples except in urgent cases or those cases that come from the higher authorities.
It was observed that there was a rampant and unexplained delay in sending the specimen to the forensic labs.
THE REASONS BEHIND THE DELAY
The officials said that no satisfactory explanation was received from the police officials on the delay.
However, some of the reasons that were cited were nonavailability of adequate staff for the evidence lockers, cases where accused was absconding or the victim was untraceable. The report said that the police officials were not provided any gloves or any tweezers nor there was a provision for storing tissue samples in formalin and saline water.
Surprisingly, the incharge of the evidence lockers (Malkhana Mohrars) were not aware of the use of formalin and saline water for storing the tissue samples. The evidence lockers lacked the air tight containers.
Upon inspection it was revealed that entire sample collected by the investigation officer is sent to the forensic labs.
There was no mechanism of retaining portion of the sample which could be sent to another laboratory for a second opinion or cross checking. Interestingly, it was found remnants received back from the FSL were not being kept back in the safe environment.

The governments move comes as part of its efforts to project the state as a ""family tourist destination"".
""Excise department is in the process of implementing the recent amendment to State Excise Act which includes ban on drinking at some public spaces. The ban is most likely to come in force from mid-November this year,"" Superintendent of Excise Department, Satyawan Bhivshet said.
He said the ban will curb the nuisance by tourists after consuming alcohol at some public places.
The department will identify and notify the list of places which mostly will include religious structures and heritage spots.
The Goa government in August this year had amended the Excise Duty Act, 1964, to make penal provisions for the people drinking in places identified as No Alcohol Consumption Zones.
The Act has specified penalty ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 10,000 for the violators.
Another excise official, on condition of anonymity, said powers of the department in the Act are described and special squads are being put in place to crackdown on the violators drinking in such zones.
Earlier, the government, while introducing the bill in the Assembly had said, ""The government is receiving a number of complaints of consumption of alcohol in open spaces, public spaces, beaches, public roads, state and national highways, mostly by visiting tourists.""
Placed before the House by Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar, the bill further read, ""Upon consumption of liquor, the bottles and cans are strewn around causing environmental degradation.

Foreigners and Indians, all couples, are dropped off by taxis at the entrance, husbands holding wives by the hand. India's cooperative milk capital has also turned into its surrogacy hub: The Sat Kaival Hospital and Akanksha Infertility Clinic run by Dr Nayana Patel, 55, and her husband Hitesh, 57, churns out 30 babies on average every month.
Surrogate No. 500, a 28-year-old single mother of two, delivered a baby girl here on August 5, an inadvertent milestone in the now routine comings and goings of cooperative commerce. Four days later, she sees the baby for the first time at the behest of the sponsoring parents, who are from Lucknow. She does not recognise the newborn from a series of photographs. ""If it's a girl, it must be mine,"" she says, blankly.
One with her own: Suman (Second from left), 32, currently carrying two surrogate babies in her womb, with her daughters Niddhi, 7, Nisha, 9, and Nirali, 11, husband Mahendra, and mother Sarithaben in Mehrau Village, Gujarat.

A year ago, she had nothing. Her younger son is three and her older one five. Abandoned by her husband at the younger child's birth, she moved in with her mother, a domestic worker who lives on the road behind Dr Patel's home. She earned Rs 2,000 a month doing housework. A friend brought her to the doctor. She has not seen her children even once since. ""I can build my own house now,"" Surrogate No. 500 says. She would not do this again, she adds. But Rs 3 lakh goes a long way in Anand, Gujarat.
Every turn on a road in Anand bears jagged signifiers of a township straining towards modernity. A chariot vendor is down the road from a gun store. Past the Subway franchise is the mandatory Amul outlet, selling shrikhand and the local mithai kaju katri from the 6.5 million kg-a-day cooperative milk union movement launched here in 1946 by Verghese Kurien.
While the world knows Anand, a town of 1.8 million, for the White Revolution, many other revolutions have since jostled for space here. There are 66 higher education institutes and two universities. The town is also an industrial engineering and emerging ship-building hub booming with the opening of the Khambhat port nearby. But it is hospitals, the Shankara Eye Hospital, the spanking new Zydus multi-speciality facility on the city outskirts and the multitude of medical agencies pharmacies, private nursing homes and clinics that drive its medical tourism. You won't find it mentioned in the 'Vibrant Gujarat' roadmap for Anand district but as far as cooperative movements go, the town offers up the mother of them all: Surrogacy.
By her side: Suresh, 29, an Ahmedabad-based auto rickshaw driver, cooks rice for his wife Seetal, 26, a surrogate mother, every weekend. By her side: Suresh, 29, an Ahmedabad-based auto rickshaw driver, cooks rice for his wife Seetal, 26, a surrogate mother, every weekend.
In 2001, Dr Patel, who had been dabbling in in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) pregnancies since 1999, took on a stray case of surrogacy for an NRI family in which the grandmother famously mothered the child to save her daughter's marriage. Featured on the Oprah Winfrey show in 2006, she has almost become an institution, instrumental in all landmark cases involving surrogacy up until now. The Indian Council of Medical Research drew up surrogacy guidelines based on Dr Patel's 2001 NRI grandmother case and subsequent cases. She hit the headlines in 2008 when the custody of Manji Yamada, a baby born to Japanese parents at Dr Patel's facility in Anand, was thrown into ambiguity after they separated before his birth.
The landmark Jan Balaz vs Union of India case, also involving Dr Patel's clinic, saw Indian citizenship being conferred on the twin babies and the due process of adoption followed. These pioneering cases conferred the surrogacy capital status on Anand.
The number of babies delivered at Dr Patel's clinic is 680 and counting. But a new draft bill in the making could remove surrogates from direct employment with the fertility clinic and put them under the influence of a surrogate agency.
Key features of the bill include:
- Surrogates must be in the age bracket 21-35.
- No surrogate should undergo implantation cycles more than three times for a couple.
- If married, a surrogate should receive consent of her spouse.
- Only Indian citizens can be considered for surrogacy.
- Surrogate mother must relinquish all filial rights over child.
- Parents must accept the child born of the surrogacy.
- IVF will be separated from surrogacy requirements, which will be outsourced to specialised agents.
Milestone mom: Surrogate mom no.500, and the 680th child born at the Sat Kaival hospital in Anand. Milestone mom: Surrogate mom no.500, and the 680th child born at the Sat Kaival hospital in Anand.
Dr Patel wishes the Government engaged more with surrogates and doctors at the local level. ""The Government is saying it will trust an agent, who may or may not be educated or humane towards surrogates, but not doctors. Why?"" she asks. ""I wonder sometimes, if there were two children, a girl and a boy, and they didn't want the boy, could I take him home?"" says Suman, 32, six months pregnant and carrying twins. She was impregnated with quadruplets and two were terminated. She hasn't been home in five months though her three daughters, Niddhi, 7, Nisha, 9, and Nirali, 11, visit her often. Suman is carrying plastic dolls she bought for them from the market today. The Eid festive air is accentuated at Mehrau village, 11 km from Anand, as villagers come out to wave, cheer and ask Suman how her pregnancy is going. Only one home in the village, that of a lawyer couple, refuses to participate. ""Are the people who talk going to put food on my plate? I have not done anything wrong, so what is there to hide?"" Suman asks as her children clamber all over her. She needs the money. Her husband earns Rs 100 a day as a labourer in the nearby fields.
Dr Patel has fought varying levels of social opposition since 2005, when she began her surrogacy programme. A third of the children born here have gone to Indian couples, another third to NRIs and the others to foreigners from over 34 different countries. All surrogates in the clinic are below 35 and mothers to at least one child of their own. They are required to meet minimum health requirements or are otherwise ""nutritionally fortified"". The husband's consent is mandatory in case of couples.

Dr Patel is now building a 100,000 sq ft hospital on the outskirts of the city that will accommodate would-be parents, surrogates, IVF facilities and neonatal units next to a vocational institute. While that is slated for a March 2014 launch, for now she must flit between Surrogate House, the designated home for surrogate moms, multiple hospitals, standalone neonatal units, and her clinic. Since her first IVF case in 1999 that yielded baby Akanksha, after whom the clinic is named, Dr Patel has been a life-giving, family-saving benefactor. It is in her genes: Her late mother, a social worker and corporator in Rajkot in the 1950s, was herself a fierce advocate of women's rights.
At the clinic, a jet-lagged Portuguese-speaking couple from Angola, the second to arrive here from that country, nervously alights from a car. The woman, 34, lean, beautiful, her face strained with emotion, has just lost her baby and her uterus to complications. ""Can we use more than one surrogate?"" she asks, in halting English. At the door is Tajima, a 34-year-old Japanese woman who lost her uterus to nuclear radiation-linked cancer a few years ago. Her baby had just been born the previous day and is in neonatal ICU at Zydus hospital. That evening, Dr Jagdish Prasad, the director general of health services, has circulated a Cabinet note on the Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill announcing a firm intention to disallow surrogacy for foreigners, on the back of the Ministry of Home Affairs already banning same-sex couples and single parents of foreign origin. At Akanksha clinic, prospective parents, with their heads bent over reports, medication and bills, ignore the news flashing on five LCD screens.

Surrogate House is a complex of two two-storied bungalows. It's Eid, August 9, and a baby shower is underway at 11 a.m. The 'parties' of Aarti, 31, Gita, 29, and Rukmini, 27, all seven months pregnant, have sent them saris, and shared the cost of the ceremony. The women don make-up and braid their hair as they slip into their new saris, stolen pleasures that bring home the reality of a pregnancy that is not quite theirs. Durga, 29, smiles. ""It's our child, we call it our child."" Rukmini has more reasons for joy. Her diamond-washer husband has just inaugurated his own store that morning. When she returns, she will open her own beauty parlour.
Housing for surrogates has often been criticised as glorified forced isolation but Dr Patel's stance is that it guarantees the health of both mother and child. Many surrogates say they prefer it. It allows them anonymity from prying neighbours or relatives. The controlled environment provides them with nutritional food and the chance to enrol in vocational classes, from chocolate-making to computers embroidery and hair and make-up. Surrogate mothers say the base rate that accrues to them from bearing babies, be it for Indian parents or foreigners, is around one-fourth of the total cost of Rs 8-11 lakh that clinics charge. What differs though, is how they are treated. Indian parents rarely encourage an engagement with the surrogate after birth.

Inside a room on the ground floor of Surrogate House, Suresh, a 28-year-old autorickshaw driver from Ahmedabad, has cooked rice for his wife Seetal, 26, pregnant with her first surrogate child. Their own two children, aged 7 and 11, are in boarding school. They want to buy a house with the Rs 4 lakh from the surrogacy. He understands, he says, that the child is not his, but has trouble not feeling affection for it. He caresses his wife's stomach affectionately. Local Methodist and Catholic churches, maulvis and priests have all preached against surrogacy to their respective congregations. In vain. ""It used to be much harder when I started. Now I don't fight because I know no one who is talking is going to give these parents a child or save these surrogates from their poverty,"" says Dr Patel.
Surrogates keep coming back because the money counts. Kaushal, 37, has three children and works as a cook now, earning Rs 2,000 a month. Her small rebuilt home in Anand has a light and fan in the hall, and a television with a cable connection. But there are no bulbs in the inner room or the kitchen. Most of the money she earned through her two surrogacies since 2007 went into unsuccessfully treating her alcoholic husband's cirrhosis and heart condition complicated by diabetes. A devout Catholic, her parish and the home she works in would both dismiss her if they found out what she had done, she fears. But thanks to the babies she carried, she doesn't need their approval to put a roof over her head. She can look God in the eye because she knows she hasn't done anything wrong. The rest, she says, she will manage.

In each of these little havens, from the muggy pressures of the day, can be found alcohol, greasy food, and girls fully, albeit provocatively, clothed, wiggling hip and limb in the hope of earning an appreciative note or two from clients. The men, meanwhile, grub together what notes they can for a flash of uncovered thigh, for the glimpse of a navel, or even cleavage into which the notes can be placed. For those who can afford it, the dancing is a precursor to a fleeting encounter in a purpose-built cubbyhole or even an hour in a grim room.
Women dance on poles. Waiters circumnavigate the room with change for tips. Numbers and addresses are exchanged on paper napkins. And the cars and SUVs converge at all hours. Dozens of bars have sprouted in the southern and northern fringes of the city. Even the centre, a stone's throw from the city police headquarters, is not immune. Outside bars in central Dharmatala pimps close in on pedestrians. ""Laagbe naki? laagbe naki?"" they hiss, ""Noorjehan, Anarkali, patakaguddi."" Show interest and you are pulled aside and shown an album of girls in glitzy costumes. Hesitate or linger a moment and you're pushed into a bar, the music-""oh baby meri chittiyaan kalaiyaan ve""-and the AC turned on full blast. Night Queen's, a bar in Esplanade, even has reviews on the website Zomato, all of them disapproving of the ""shadiness"".

That these bars are sleazy is not in doubt. But are they illegal? The Maharashtra government has tried to ban dance bars, and failed. In April this year, the Supreme Court once again reminded the Maharashtra government of its responsibilities. ""As the state,"" said Justice Dipak Misra in April, ""your job is to protect the dignity of these women in their workplace. Your attitude should not go into the extremes of prohibition when you are only supposed to regulate.... In case the performances slip into obscenity, it naturally stops having legal permissibility and the Indian Penal Code will take care of the rest."" In Kolkata, few are arguing that these dance bars are flouting the law, even if the law is nebulous. According to Section 239 of the West Bengal Excise Act, no licensed retail vendor is allowed to hold any professional entertainment or dance or live music, vocal or instrumental, without the special sanction of the District Magistrate or, in Kolkata, the Excise Collector and Police Commissioner.
So-called 'crooning' licences are granted at the discretion of the police department. ""The licence issued by civic bodies has no provision called 'dancing licence',"" points out SDPO, Baruipur, Arka Banerjee, who has raided several of these bars. In May, last year, he led a team that rescued 25 girls from a bar near VIP Road. The girls had been trafficked from Haryana, Punjab, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, a reversal of the usual trend in which girls from West Bengal are trafficked in the north. ""The problem,"" Banerjee says, ""is that while bar owners can be booked for a show of obscenity in public, the offence is bailable. There are non-bailable sections for trafficking, but a senior cop of deputy superintendent rank or above has to lodge the complaint on the basis of which arrests and seizures are made and investigations started. But there are over 100 bars in the northern outskirts and it isn't humanly possible for senior police officers to keep track of what is happening in these bars when there are more pressing problems at hand.""
Bishakha Datta, who runs the NGO Point of View, argues that ""rather than focusing on the obscenity issue, the emphasis should be on providing safe working conditions for women, whether they are being financially exploited or not, their right to safe mobility, whether clients are taking a lunge at them or harassing them, just like in any other profession"".
The first alarm against these bars in Kolkata was raised in March 2015, when 21-year-old Twinkle and her 18-year-old sister Rosy Rajput lodged an FIR with the Baguiati police station against their employer for forcing them to entertain a client who tried to rape them. The girls alleged that they were brought to Kolkata by a Manu Agnihotri, who promised them a job and placed them in a flat in Chinar Park. Girls from the north of the country are of particular appeal here. SDPO Banerjee says that ""analysis of what FIRs there are show that the majority of girls are trafficked from north India. The bait is an office job or housekeeping at a hotel. Very rarely are victims able to file a complaint because they are kept under tight surveillance, but when they do, it is because they are being denied a 'fair' share of the profits"". Sometimes dancers turn to NGOs. ""When we cannot take it anymore,"" says Pooja Singh (name changed) from Punjab, ""when a band leader exploits us, for instance, we seek help despite the risk of being murdered. One friend of mine contracted a venereal disease, and the bar owner, instead of having her treated, fired her without notice and without pay.""

Accurate statistics about trafficking are hard to come by, but the Kolkata police maintain that most girls from out of the state are brought to the city under false pretence. The money, though, motivates many to keep going. And the profits for everyone, from dancers to so-called band leaders to bar owners to the politicians said to be involved, are large enough to keep bars thriving. Band leaders are the key middlemen. They arrange the girls, provided by pimps and touts, look after their accommodation and rent floors from bars. One band leader, on the condition of anonymity, explained his role: ""The cost of providing shelter to these girls is high. We look for flats in 'posh' areas where people don't ask too many questions and there is a mixed crowd. Sometimes rent costs as much as Rs 30,000."" The bar owner rents his space to the band leader and ensures that politicians don't interfere. An employee of one bar, who gave his name as Arif, said that the ""lease of floors can cost as much as Rs 20 lakh a month but earnings on a single weekend night can be Rs 15-20 lakh. Popular bars bring in revenue of Rs 80 lakh-2crore a month, and the most popular dancers can earn one, or even two, lakhs rupees a month.""
Owners such as Jagjit Singh and Ajmal Siddiqui, whose names figure in the police records, are said to be multi-millionaires, with bars abroad, in the likes of Pattaya, a resort city in Thailand. Jagjit Singh was a taxi driver. At Down Town, his first bar, he used to provide a free beer for every purchase of a bottle of alcohol. In 2006, as Salt Lake was being turned into an IT hub, and New Town (Rajarhat) was taking off, Singh put himself in prime position to open new bars. A police officer at the Bidhannagar police station said that ""such is Jagjit Singh's political clout that despite the Inspector-in-Charge (IC) of Baguiati police station Sukomal Das lodging an FIR against him, he could not be arrested. Two people who had been arrested in connection with human trafficking confessed that they supplied women on the orders of Jagjit Singh, the owner of Sunset Bar. It made no difference."" Singh, police say, is so brazen that he led a mob to the station after a banning order against dance bars. ""We picked him up,"" says another officer at the Bidhannagar police station, ""on a non-bailable charge for damaging government property, but he was freed on bail after 15 days-it was a court holiday and the government lawyer did not appear.""
According to Congress leader Arunava Ghosh, ""the nexus between politicians and bar owners is a well-known thing. The municipality responsible for giving trade licences is controlled by the ruling party and political patronage is given in exchange of favours of all kinds, including money to contest election campaigns."" The political protection means that despite complaints from people in the neighbourhoods around bars police do little. In July last year, they were stirred into action when a man was shot and killed after a brawl at a dance bar. Accounts of the brawl said that a group of young men who had been turned away from the bar for dancing on tables returned with guns and even petrol bombs.

Information and documentation provided by NGO India Smile, led by Rajeev Sarkar, have also led to raids. In October last year, the Bidhannagar police commissioner, Jawed Shamim, issued a memo, strongly objecting to the issuing of further permits and no-objection certificates for dancing in bars in his jurisdiction. He was soon transferred. India Smile filed a public interest litigation in April last year. On May 20 this year, the Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court, Manjula Chellur, directed Sarkar himself to essentially keep tabs on illegal activity and report it to the police. ""The petitioner,"" the judgement read, ""is at liberty to file contempt petition against the violators... the petitioner is at liberty to intimate the police, who shall act immediately upon such complaint."" Sarkar says he has ""already faced an attack on my life. The ministry of home affairs asked the state government to provide me with security. But from what the court expects me to do, I don't think I will manage to live for long"".
For Subrata Biswas, the Collector of Excise in Kolkata, ""the problem is not significant. Live performance is happening but since there is no law and order problem, there is no intervention either from the police or from us."" Tell that to the girls who claim to have been trafficked or mistreated. To the people living around the bars who complain of feeling unsafe, menaced by the people who hang around the bars. Bars need not be a problem if properly regulated but it appears the city prefers to do its business in the half-dark, not unlike the clientele in dance bars."

New Delhi, Aug 3 (PTI) In a unique initiative, Delhi Police have started weekly sessions for its personnel struggling with alcoholism, in which they learn to deal with the problem from those who have beaten the addiction and now working with Alcoholics Anonymous.
""The entire programme, comprising of three stages, was launched one-and-half months ago,"" said Suman Nalwa DCP and Principal of Police Training School, Dwarka.
So far, six districts have been covered. Experts from Alcoholics Anonymous share their own experience and ways that helped them get rid of the addiction, she said.
In the coming weeks, such sessions will be held in all 11 police districts to cover over 76,000 personnel of the force. Delhi Polices largest wing, the Police Control Room (PCR), comprising nearly 10,000 personnel, is currently organising the sessions held on Saturdays.
""People feel that alcohol is harming them, their family and social life but do not know how to give it up. Also, many dont know what alcoholism means,"" Nalwa said.
""The initiative is aimed at helping those struggling with alcoholism and also create awareness among the police force so that they can tackle alcohol-related problems like street violence and domestic disputes in a more effective manner,"" she said.
The DCP said the sessions held so far have registered good participation and police personnel come out with very revealing questions and information during the interactions.
The whole programme of fighting alcoholism involves three steps. In the first step, the participants are made aware of alcoholism and what it means. In the second and third steps, they and the family members interact with the experts.
Also, those struggling with alcoholism are educated about 12 facts related to alcoholism which help them in getting rid of the problem, Nalwa said. PTI VIT NSD RG NSD"
46,The FDI big bang,[],2016-06-27 10:44:17,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201606/cs-fdi-jul4-1_647_062316043446.jpg,"At 10 am on Monday, June 20, key bureaucrats of the Union finance and commerce ministries filed into the sandstone corridors of the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) for a crucial meeting with Narendra Modi. It was barely two days after RBI governor Raghuram Rajan announced he was not going to seek a second term. The PMO meeting to take stock of the government's new FDI policy had been scheduled for Tuesday, but had been brought forward. The markets had by then opened 'in the red', with the Nifty and Sensex taking slight dips and the rupee losing 0.8 per cent of its value against the dollar.
The government was in damage control mode over 'Rexit' as the governor's departure was popularly called. At 2 pm, PM Modi led the charge with two tweets from his official Twitter handle. ""Key reform decisions were taken at a high-level meeting, which makes India the most open economy in the world for FDI.""
The markets recovered from their initial dip and closed in the green. At 3.30, Union commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman rolled out the specifics of the policy; India had flung its doors open wider to foreign investment. Foreigners could now own airlines, set up food processing firms, defence manufacturing units and buy pharmaceutical companies. It was the most assiduous wooing of FDI in the 20 years since the government had first looked to foreign exchange as a fuel to kickstart the engines of its economy.
Bureaucrats had worked on the raft of big-bang FDI proposals for a month. It was decided to administer FDI as a palliative in a week of uncertainty-the exit of a globally feted RBI governor and the economic consequences of a 'Brexit', Britain's vote for a possible exit from the European Union on June 23. Six FDI sectors-pharmaceuticals, food processing, information and broadcasting, air transport, single-brand retail and defence-saw approvals for 100 per cent FDI.
""Earlier, 91 per cent of total investments to India were on an automatic approval mode, now over 95 per cent of FDI will be automatically approved,"" Amitabh Kant, CEO of NITI Aayog, told India Today.
Two years on, the Modi government has emphatically articulated its economic philosophy and cast aside concerns that they might be wedded to the idea of a more protectionist state. ""They have departed from expectations and from the RSS's way of thinking,"" says a Mumbai-based economist.
OPEN FOR BUSINESS
""FDI ghar baithe baithe nahin aati (FDI doesn't come sitting at home),"" Union external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj told the media in New Delhi on June 19. She was explaining her government's massive diplomatic outreach where it hopes to have established contact with all the countries of the world by the year-end. This includes Modi's 38 foreign trips and the roadshows in Madison Square Garden, Wembley Stadium and in the UAE, all in the past two years. Swaraj identified the number one objective of this outreach: to increase FDI in India, the stated aim of various governments since the dawn of economic liberalisation 25 years ago. They have tried to attract and promote FDI to supplement domestic capital, technology and skills to accelerate economic growth, with mixed results. Until 2005, FDI inflows into India accounted for only 0.8 per cent of the global total. Successive governments, including the UPA, have adopted the incremental approach to increasing FDI. But under the Modi government, FDI has been pursued with missionary zeal. In 2015, India attracted $44 billion in foreign investment, or 2.51 per cent of world FDI flows.
The reasons for the government's FDI zeal are crisis-driven. The Indian economy faces a threefold challenge, as pointed out by a World Bank Study-India Development Update-released on June 20. India, the report says, needs to activate its stalled engines-agricultural growth and rural demand; trade; and private investment-while ensuring that the active engines, pickup in industrial activity and the services sector do not run out of fuel. From a peak of 24 per cent in 2009-10, gross capital formation grew at zero per cent last year. With private investment depressed, the government is turning to the world for investment.
Pushing FDI-related reforms through are among the simplest options because they do not require legislative approval. The Modi government's FDI policy was put together by commerce ministry bureaucrats. Easing FDI across sectors and placing most sectors on the automatic route, it essentially means investors can skip the layers of India's notoriously tardy bureaucracy if they want to invest in the country. It is targeted towards implementing the government's promise of improving the ease of doing business in India, apart from giving infrastructure and rural economy a push.
""The decision is to encourage investment which will lead to job creation,"" says Shaktikanta Das, secretary, department of economic affairs. ""This is in sync with the government's philosophy of minimum government and maximum governance.""
MORE BANG FOR THE BUCK
The Modi government's loudest bang was in defence. In July 2014, just two months after the government was sworn in, it increased FDI quotas in the sector from 26 per cent to 49 per cent. Foreign firms could own 49 per cent in their Indian subsidiaries, provided they parted with 'cutting-edge technology'. The government believed this would invite a flood of foreign firms into the country wanting to make fighter jets, tanks and warships. Nothing of the sort happened, partly because the defence industry is a monopsony, the government is the sole buyer. Foreign firms were loath to part with precious technology in an enterprise where they held only a minority stake. And it took the government less than two years and a cringeworthy statement from Union defence minister Manohar Parrikar on April 29 to realise how lacklustre that policy had been. Parrikar noted the FDI flow in defence after the government's new liberalised policy in a written reply to the Lok Sabha. ""Between August 2014 and February 2016, a total amount of Rs 112.35 lakh (Rs 1.12 crore) has come into the country as FDI in the defence sector.""
The new policy makes it attractive for foreign defence firms to use India as a base for manufacturing, utilising manpower and the skilled workforce to export arms to third countries. There is currently just one proposal pending approval for 100 per cent FDI with the government, from French naval shipbuilder DCNS to set up a facility to build air-independent propulsion units for submarines. More proposals are likely to materialise with the new FDI norms. Gurnad Sodhi, MD, ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems India, which hopes to build conventional submarines for the Indian navy, terms the FDI move a ""giant leap towards India's goal for robust and comprehensive growth in defence manufacturing"".
""It shows the government's commitment towards defence manufacturing within the country and creating more jobs for the youth of the country,"" says Puneet Kaura, MD and CEO, Samtel Avionics, which makes cockpit displays for fighter aircraft. ""It will ease technology transfer as investors will see value in their investments.""
Parrikar had plumped for deep-seated reform of the defence ministry, pushing for funding SMEs and strategic partnerships with Indian firms for major defence projects to build warships, fighter jets and submarines. The move was part of the government's push to create a robust defence industrial base and end the unhappy dependence on imports-India imports over 60 per cent of its military hardware. The new FDI policy allowing foreign defence firms to wholly own their Indian subsidiaries has sent a wave of optimism through foreign defence majors, particularly since the policy replaces 'cutting-edge technology' with 'high technology'. ""State-of-the-art technology was not defined in the previous policy,"" says Pierre de Bausset, president, Airbus Group India, ""and the way it was, it conveyed a one-dimensional perspective on why a foreign OEM (original equipment manufacturer) could require more equity stake."" He hails the defence FDI policy amendment as pragmatic.
In civil aviation, the government opened up brownfield airports to 100 per cent ownership by foreign firms. This comes just five days after the new civil aviation policy, which includes an ambitious vision of promoting subsidised internal air travel, an 'affordable open sky policy' and the construction of no-frills airports at nearly 350 disused airfields. Opening up the civil aviation sector, including allowing foreigners to buy airlines, the government hopes, will bring in the capital to give wings to its civil aviation policy.
FARMING OUT TO PHARMA
The FDI push couldn't have been more welcome in pharmaceuticals, a sector where Indian firms have made a global mark with affordable versions of off-patent drugs of multinational firms. While the existing norm allowed 100 per cent FDI in brownfield or existing projects but only through government approval, the new norms allow 74 per cent approval under the automatic route and, beyond that, through government approval. ""The pharma sector is one we should nurture, since we have significant export potential,"" says D.K. Joshi, chief economist with ratings firm Crisil. At Rs 96,000 crore in 2014-15, Indian pharma exports grew another 10 per cent in FY 2015-16, the commerce ministry said in April this year, with the US market alone posting 33 per cent growth. The Indian pharma industry has a potential to grow from the present $20 billion to $55 billion by 2020, says consulting firm McKinsey.
However, the sector has its own challenges, be it the widening net of price controls or the slowing growth of the US generics market which has become intensely competitive. In that sense, raising the FDI cap for brownfield projects comes as a shot in the arm for companies looking to seek foreign capital, including private equity. ""The move is bound to attract more investment in the sector through the M&A (mergers & acquisitions) route,"" says Sarabjit Kaur Nangra, VP, research, at brokerage firm Angel Broking. There is a lot of interest in the Indian market, but Nangra says the issue is with the high valuations of Indian companies. This was evident in the high-profile pharma sell-offs involving foreign companies. In 2008, Japanese firm Daiichi Sankyo bought Ranbaxy Laboratories for $4.6 billion, while US firm Abbott Labs paid $3.7 billion for Piramal Healthcare's domestic formulations business. Although the high valuations remain a deterrent, the road has now been laid for more investments. Says Devraj Singh, executive director, tax and regulatory services, EY, ""The FDI policy change will definitely reduce the timeline for cross-border M&As in the pharma sector which will lead to more funds coming into India in this sector.""
VEERING FROM SWADESHI
The Modi government has set itself on a collision course with its ideological parent with its FDI reform. The RSS's economic think-tank, the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, has called the government's decision to allow 100 per cent FDI in food processing for trading in e-commerce a 'betrayal' of farmers and traders of the country.
The Modi government has so far maintained an uneasy truce between the Sangh and the BJP over allowing FDI in multi-brand retail. This is because the RSS and the party count traders among their core supporters. They will now be directly hit by the liberalised FDI norms. Expecting this for a while, this year their fears have come true. Beginning with Arun Jaitley's budget this year, the government has been nudging at FDI in retail. The budget permitted 100 per cent FDI in food retail. The new policy now permits FDI in food processing, much to the RSS's ire. This is why investors are waiting to figure out how far they can go and decide on their investment patterns for selling food products manufactured and produced in India.
SJM national convenor Kashmiri Lal told India Today this will move towards the centralisation of the food segment and eventually not allow diversification of food choices for consumers. ""This is against the core philosophy of the RSS and their thought leaders,"" he said.
Finance minister Jaitley has tried to placate the RSS leadership, without much success. The Sangh's belligerent stand is making investors nervous. FDI for selling food could be a good first step, they say, it should not be the last. Their worst fear-the RSS might force the government to allow state governments to decide. Many BJP chief ministers are uncomfortable opening up this segment. This is why several major retailers are pushing for an exemption from the 'state government approval' clause as one of the preconditions to their investments. US retail giant Walmart, at the forefront of opening up this sector, too, is treading cautiously. ""We are awaiting the policy document and will study it before making any commitment,"" Krish Iyer, president and CEO, Walmart India, said. Walmart has so far shied away from investing in multi-brand retail, but is a significant player in the cash and carry business (stores that target professional customers rather than end-consumers).
The new tweaks may not make much business sense for most of the existing players, but many of them believe it to be a significant milestone in the journey to opening up multi-brand retail as a whole. ""The new tweaks might allow many players to bring in some bit of their capital, and ascertain a first-mover advantage, but they must not expect good return on their investments overnight,"" says a CEO of a top multi-brand retail company, choosing to remain anonymous.
SETTING THE HOUSE IN ORDER
UNCTAD's 'World Investment Report 2016' predicts that India's large-scale increase of announced greenfield investments in manufacturing may provide FDI further impetus. India, together with China, Myanmar and Vietnam, could prove exceptions in the global and regional slowdown. The World Bank study released on June 20 predicts that FDI, which reached record highs in 2015-16, is likely to remain robust. ""As the government continues to open additional sectors of the economy, FDI is expected to be sufficient to finance the current account deficit (where values of imports are greater than value of exports) in the projection period,"" the study states. Yet, getting FDI is only part of the challenge. The fine print is the problem. The government's FDI thrust last November was slow to pick up in defence, multi- and single-brand retail for various reasons. Global FDI inflows are unpredictable and seek swift returns on investment. Foreign firms have not invested in the government-controlled railway infrastructure. Technology giant Apple Inc. had expressed concerns with the 30 per cent sourcing clause for single-brand retail stores (relaxed in the current policy for 'cutting-edge technologies'). While the government hopes to create jobs and generate investments with these reforms, there are a host of challenges that would determine the India FDI story.
""India should set a target of $100 billion FDI. It's not just about opening up sectors, it is also about promoting India as a market, making India predictable. We need to make it easy to do business in India. Predictability in tax is very important,"" says Amitabh Kant.
The Indian case, given the difficulties associated with exiting or taking profits out of the country, is a bit peculiar. Investors and companies often factor in the regulations that will bind them after they enter India. A leading beer manufacturer wants to up its $500 million investment to $3 billion if the Indian government provides greater transparency in application of tax on alcohol production. The company has invested over $10 billion in China. It wants alcohol to be placed under the proposed Goods and Services Tax.
Experts who advise companies on investing in India say many of them are holding back because of policies impinging on profitability. The government is yet to emphatically clarify its stand on issues such as retrospective taxation and transfer pricing.
Overall, while the message from the government is that India is an open economy, for it to generate real and sustained interest, it will have to sort out the basics. ""This is one piece of a broader ease-of-doing business programme. We had become a very difficult place to do business. It has become easier, but we have a long way to go. Having states compete with each other is a powerful dynamic that is being unleashed,"" says Naushad Forbes, president, CII. Not one state met all the criteria of the DIPP's ease of doing business rankings released last year. Clearly, India still has plenty of house-keeping to do before it can attract more foreign capital.

But who decides how much is too much and that the offensive 'trolls' and nasty comments are not amounting to online harassment?
The courts will, of course. An Australian man, Zane Alchin, pleaded guilty for threatening a 23-year-old woman with rape and harassing her with repeated offensive comments and Facebook posts.
How did it all start?
In 2015, 23-year-old Olivia Melville, an Australian woman, came to know that a man had posted a screenshot of her Tinder profile on Facebook.
She had used the lyrics from a song by rapper Nicki Minaj that read, ""I am the kind of girl who would suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you"" in her Tinder bio. Since the time the screenshot of her profile was posted on Facebook by Chris Hall, Olivia was insulted and slut-shamed. She even received rape threats from social media users.
Out of the many who were commenting on Olivia's photo was Zane Alchin, who wrote more than 50 posts in response to Olivia. He wrote, ""the best thing about a feminist is that they don't get any action, so when you rape them it feels 100 times tighter.""
When Olivia's friends came to her rescue, 25-year-old Alchin messed with them as well. ""I'd rape you if you were better looking,"" wrote Alchin responding to a woman who called him out.
""I couldn't go home after work for five days. I couldn't be alone and I was really scared. I was getting all these messages from people, and that was the most frightening thing - people were just bombarding me, abusing me, and saying I was in the wrong,"" Olivia told ABC News.

Olivia's come-back campaign: Sexual Violence Won't Be Silenced
After having a hard time recovering from all the slut-shaming, Olivia and her friends started a campaign group - Sexual Violence Won't Be Silenced - to raise awareness about sexism and online abuse.
Alchin's offensive comments and threats were handed over to the police last year and he was subsequently arrested.
In January, Alchin pleaded not guilty to the charges and used being under the influence of alcohol as an excuse. He also said he wasn't aware that he is breaking laws by commenting.
Alchin has been charged with ""using a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence"", and has pledged guilty to making sexual threats. He will be be sentenced on July 29 and might face up to three years in prison."

54,"US asks Pak to make full payment for F-16, no subsidy",[],2016-05-03 11:10:41,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"From Lalit K Jha
Washington, May 3 (PTI) The US has asked Pakistan to ""put forward"" its ""national funds"" to buy eight F-16 fighter jets after some top American Senators put a hold on the use of tax payers money to partially finance them, a move that may create a hurdle for the deal.
""While Congress has approved the sale, key members have made clear that they object to using FMF (foreign military financing) to support it. Given Congressional objections, we have told the Pakistanis that they should put forward national funds for that purpose,"" US State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters at his daily news conference yesterday.
Kirby, however, did not say when this decision was taken and when was it communicated to Pakistan.
On February 11, the State Department had informed the Congress about its determination for selling eight F-16s to Pakistan at an estimated cost of USD 700 million. The move was opposed by the Indian government which summoned the US Ambassador to India, Richard Verma, to lodge its protest.
US top American lawmakers led by Senator Bob Corker, Chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, put a hold on the sale arguing that it would not let the Obama administration use tax payers money for sale of the fighter jets to Pakistan given that Islamabad was not taking enough action against terrorist organisations, in particular the Haqqani network and there was continued existence of terrorist safe havens inside its territory.
Last week, top American lawmakers during a Congressional hearing openly told the Obama administration that they feared Pakistan would be using these F-16 fighter jets against India and not against terrorists.
However, both the Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan and the Pakistan government insisted that F-16 is an important tool in the fight against terrorism and urged the Congress to remove the hold. The lawmakers stood their ground and told the Obama administration that it will not till the time Pakistan takes tangible action against the Haqqani network.
Now Pakistan has time till May end to avail the American offer to procure F-16s.
Sources here told PTI that the May deadline for Pakistan to respond to the new development from the US is based on ""offer validity and (Lockheeds) production process"" point of view.
Any delay in the acceptance of the offer, would result in increase in cost of F-16s.
However, speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior Pakistani official told PTI that Pakistan is unlikely to buy F-16s at its full price as being told by the United States now.
Earlier, Pakistan was to pay only USD 270 million for the jets.

Washington, May 3 (PTI) The US has asked Pakistan to ""put forward"" its ""national funds"" to buy eight F-16 fighter jets after some top American Senators put a hold on the use of tax payers money to partially finance them, a move that may create a hurdle for the deal.
""While Congress has approved the sale, key members have made clear that they object to using FMF (foreign military financing) to support it. Given Congressional objections, we have told the Pakistanis that they should put forward national funds for that purpose,"" US State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters at his daily news conference yesterday.
Kirby, however, did not say when this decision was taken and when was it communicated to Pakistan.
On February 11, the State Department had informed the Congress about its determination for selling eight F-16s to Pakistan at an estimated cost of USD 700 million. The move was opposed by the Indian government which summoned the US Ambassador to India, Richard Verma, to lodge its protest.
US top American lawmakers led by Senator Bob Corker, Chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, put a hold on the sale arguing that it would not let the Obama administration use tax payers money for sale of the fighter jets to Pakistan given that Islamabad was not taking enough action against terrorist organisations, in particular the Haqqani network and there was continued existence of terrorist safe havens inside its territory.

56,"South Korea covered up mass abuse, killings",[],2016-04-23 00:08:51,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201604/south-korea-story_647_042216115309.jpg,"The 14-year-old boy in the black school jacket stared at his sneakers, his heart pounding, as the policeman accused him of stealing a piece of bread.
Even now, more than 30 years later, Choi Seung-woo weeps when he describes all that happened next. The policeman yanked down the boy's pants and sparked a cigarette lighter near Choi's genitals until he confessed to a crime he didn't commit. Then two men with clubs came and dragged Choi off to the Brothers Home, a mountainside institution where some of the worst human rights atrocities in modern South Korean history took place.
A guard in Choi's dormitory raped him that night in 1982 - and the next, and the next. So began five hellish years of slave labor and near-daily assaults, years in which Choi saw men and women beaten to death, their bodies carted away like garbage.
Choi was one of thousands - the homeless, the drunk, but mostly children and the disabled - rounded up off the streets ahead of the 1988 Seoul Olympics, which the ruling dictators saw as international validation of South Korea's arrival as a modern country. An Associated Press investigation shows that the abuse of these so-called vagrants at Brothers, the largest of dozens of such facilities, was much more vicious and widespread than previously known, based on hundreds of exclusive documents and dozens of interviews with officials and former inmates.
Yet nobody has been held accountable to date for the rapes and killings at the Brothers compound because of a cover-up orchestrated at the highest levels of government, the AP found. Two early attempts to investigate were suppressed by senior officials who went on to thrive in high-profile jobs; one remains a senior adviser to the current ruling party. Products made using slave labor at Brothers were sent to Europe, Japan and possibly beyond, and the family that owned the institution continued to run welfare facilities and schools until just two years ago.
Even as South Korea prepares for its second Olympics, in 2018, thousands of traumatized former inmates have still received no compensation, let alone public recognition or an apology. The few who now speak out want a new investigation.
The current government, however, refuses to revisit the case, and is blocking a push by an opposition lawmaker to do so on the grounds that the evidence is too old.
Ahn Jeong-tae, an official from Seoul's Ministry of the Interior, said focusing on just one human rights incident would financially burden the government and set a bad precedent. The Brothers' victims, he said, should have submitted their case to a temporary truth-finding commission established in the mid-2000s to investigate past atrocities.
""We can't make separate laws for every incident and there have been so many incidents since the Korean War,"" Ahn said.
Former inmates, however, cannot forget. One spent months standing quietly in front of the National Assembly with a signboard demanding justice. Choi has attempted suicide several times and now attends weekly therapy sessions.
""The government has consistently tried to bury what happened. How do you fight that? If we spoke up, who would have heard us?"" he asked. ""I am wailing, desperate to tell our story. Please listen to us.""

""HELL WITHIN A HELL""
Once an orphanage, Brothers Home at its peak had more than 20 factories churning out woodwork, metalwork, clothing, shoes and other goods made by mostly unpaid inmates. The sprawling compound of concrete buildings rose above the southern port city of Busan, its inmates hidden from view by tall walls and kept there by guards who carried bats and patrolled with dogs.
The horrors that happened behind those walls are inextricably linked to South Korea's modern history.
The country at the time was still recovering from the near-total devastation of the 1950-53 Korean War, which followed nearly four decades of brutal Japanese colonization. From the 1960s until the '80s, before democracy, it was ruled by military dictators who focused overwhelmingly on improving the economy.
In 1975, dictator President Park Chung-hee, father of current President Park Geun-hye, issued a directive to police and local officials to ""purify"" city streets of vagrants. Police officers, assisted by shop owners, rounded up panhandlers, small-time street merchants selling gum and trinkets, the disabled, lost or unattended children, and dissidents, including a college student who'd been holding anti-government leaflets.
They ended up as prisoners at 36 nationwide facilities. By 1986, the number of inmates had jumped over five years from 8,600 to more than 16,000, according to government documents obtained by AP.
Nearly 4,000 were at Brothers. But about 90 percent of them didn't even meet the government's definition of ""vagrant"" and therefore shouldn't have been confined there, former prosecutor Kim Yong Won told the AP, based on Brothers' records and interviews compiled before government officials ended his investigation.
The inner workings of Brothers are laid bare by former inmate Lee Chae-sik, who had extraordinary access as personal assistant to the man in charge of enforcing the rules. The AP independently verified many of the details provided by Lee, now 46, through government documents.
Lee was sent to Brothers at 13 after trouble at school. His first job was in a medical ward. Twice a day, Lee and four others, none of whom had medical training, would try to care for patients, often dousing their open wounds with disinfectant or removing maggots with tweezers.
""People screamed in pain, but we couldn't do much,"" Lee said. ""It was a hell within a hell. The patients had been left there to die.""
Stronger inmates raped and beat the weak and stole their food, he said. Lee attempted suicide after a guard at the medical ward raped him.
A year later, he was made personal assistant to chief enforcer Kim Kwang-seok, who like other guards at Brothers was an inmate raised to power by the owner because of his loyalty. Many former inmates remember Kim as the facility's most feared man. The AP tried repeatedly to track Kim down but could not find him.
Lee said he was present when Kim, a short, stocky man with sunburned skin, led near-daily, often fatal beatings at the compound's ""corrections room."" Lee accompanied Kim as he compiled a twice-a-day tally of the sick and dead for the owner; four or five daily deaths were often on the list.
A scene recounted by Lee provides a firsthand account of the efficient, almost casually evil way the facility worked. One morning, Kim approached owner Park In-keun on his daily jog to report that yet another inmate had been beaten to death the night before. The boy heard Park order Kim to bury the body in the hills behind the compound's walls.
___
MONEY FROM SLAVES
The violence at Brothers happened in the shadow of a massive money-making operation partly based on slave labor. The factories were ostensibly meant to train inmates for future jobs. But by the end of 1986, Brothers saw a profit from 11 of them, according to Busan city government documents obtained exclusively by the AP.
The documents show that Brothers should have paid the current equivalent of $1.7 million to more than 1,000 inmates for their dawn-to-dusk work over an unspecified period. However, facility records and interviews with inmates at the time suggest that, instead, most of the nearly 4,000 people at Brothers were subject to forced labor without pay, according to prosecutor Kim.
Another probe at the time, quickly scrapped by the government, showed that ""nearly none"" of about 100 inmates interviewed received payment. None of 20 former inmates interviewed by the AP received money while at Brothers either, though three got small payments later.
Adults worked on construction jobs, both at Brothers and off-site. Children sometimes hauled dirt and built walls, but mostly they assembled ballpoint pens and fishing hooks.
Some products were tied to other countries. For example, dress shirts made at Brothers' sewing factory were sent to Europe, and inmates were trained by employees at Daewoo, a major clothing exporter during the 1980s to the United States and other markets, according to the owner's autobiography. Park, the owner, said officials from Daewoo had toured the facility before offering a partnership. Daewoo International spokesman Kim Jin-ho said it was impossible to confirm such details because of a lack of records from the time.
Inmates during the 1970s recounted spending long hours tying fishing lines to hooks for packages with Japanese writing on them, for export to Japan.
Kim Hee-gon, an inmate at Brothers for eight years, said he and his colleagues were beaten severely in the early 1970s after thousands of such packages shipped to Japan were returned because they were faulty or missing hooks. Park Gyeong-bo, who was confined at Brothers from 1975 to 1980, remembered sneaker bottoms produced with the logo of Kukje Sangsa, a now-defunct company that manufactured shoes for the United States and Europe in the 1970s and 80s.
The operation thrived because everybody benefited, except the inmates.
Local officials needed somewhere to put the vagrants they were charged with corralling, so each year they renewed a contract with Brothers that required an inspection of how the inmates were treated and of how the facility was financially managed. Brothers got government subsidies based on its number of inmates, so it pushed police to round up more vagrants, the early probe found. And police officers were often promoted depending on how many vagrants they picked up.
Two Busan city officials would say only that the facts are difficult to confirm now because the facility closed three decades ago. Heo Gwi-yong, a spokesman for the Busan Metropolitan Police Agency, said he couldn't confirm any details for the same reason.
The owner of Brothers, Park, received two state medals for social welfare achievements and sat on a government advisory panel. His version of his story even inspired a 1985 television drama about a man's heroic devotion to caring for what were called ""bottom-life people.""
Park eventually served a short prison stint for embezzlement and other relatively minor charges, but not for the abuse at Brothers. When the facility was at last raided in 1987, investigators found a vault in Park's office filled with the current equivalent of about $5 million in U.S. and Japanese currencies and certificates of deposit.
In his autobiography, in court hearings and in talks with close associates, Park has denied wrongdoing and maintained that he simply followed government orders. Repeated attempts to contact him through family, friends and activists were unsuccessful.
The AP, however, tracked down the former second-highest management official at Brothers, Lim Young-soon, who bristled in a telephone interview at descriptions of corruption, violence and slavery at the facility. Lim, a Protestant pastor now in Australia who is the brother of Park's wife, said Park was a ""devoted"" social worker who made Busan better by cleaning its streets of troublemakers. He said Brothers' closure ""damaged national interests.""
Lim acknowledged beating deaths at Brothers, but said they were caused by clashes between inmates. He attributed the facility's high death toll to the many inmates he said arrived there in poor physical and mental health.
""These were people who would have died in the streets anyway,"" Lim said.
___
""I DIDN'T LIVE AS A HUMAN""
While Park raked in the money, the death toll mounted and the inmates struggled to survive.
On his second day at Brothers, still dazed from his brutal rape the night before, Choi waited with other children to be stripped and washed. He said he watched a guard drag a woman by her hair and then beat her with a club until blood flowed from her head.
""I just stood there, trembling like a leaf,"" Choi, 46, said. ""I couldn't even scream when the platoon leader later raped me again.""
Another time, Choi recalled, he saw seven guards knock down a screaming man, cover him with a blue blanket and stomp and beat him. Blood seeped through the blanket. When it fell away, the dead man's eyes had rolled back into his head.
Death tallies compiled by the facility claimed 513 people died between 1975 and 1986; the real toll was almost certainly higher. Prosecutor Kim interviewed multiple inmates who said facility officials refused to send people to hospitals until they were nearly dead for fear of escape.
""The facility was Park's kingdom, and violence was how he ruled,"" Kim said of the owner. ""When you are confined to a place where people are getting beaten to death every day, you aren't likely to complain too much about forced labor, abuse or getting raped.""
Most of the new arrivals at Brothers were in relatively good health, government documents show. Yet at least 15 inmates were dead within just a month of arrival in 1985, and 22 in 1986.
Of the more than 180 documented deaths at Brothers in 1985 and 1986, 55 of the death certificates were issued by a single doctor, Chung Myung-kuk, according to internal facility documents, interviews and records compiled by Kim. Chung, now dead, mostly listed the cause of death as ""heart failure"" and ""general weakness.""
Life at Brothers began before dawn, as inmates washed and got ready for mandatory 5:30 a.m. prayers, transmitted by loudspeaker from the facility's Presbyterian church. After a morning run, they ate breakfast and then headed to factories or construction sites.
When city officials, foreign missionaries or aid workers visited, a select group of healthy inmates worked for hours to prepare a sanitized version of Brothers for the guests. Guards locked everyone else in their dormitories. Choi said inmates watched hopelessly as these clueless do-gooders trooped through.
""We were trapped in a prison. But who could help us? No one,"" Choi said.
Once the doors were locked at 6 p.m., Choi said, the guards unleashed ""uncontrolled violence"" upon the 60 to 100 kids in his dormitory, including frequent rapes.
A principal at a Busan school who once taught at Brothers acknowledged that inmates were held against their will, and even called the facility a massive concentration camp. However, the principal, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was worried about his reputation, staunchly defended its practices. He said severe violence and military-style discipline were the only ways to run a place filled with thousands of unruly people who didn't want to be there.
Park Sun-yi, who had been snatched by police at age 9 from a Busan train station in 1980, was one of the few to escape.
She had watched as the guards reserved their most ruthless beatings, the kind where inmates sometimes didn't recover, for those who tried to run. But after five years, she said, she became ""consumed with the thought that my life might be like this forever and that I might die here.""
She and five other girls used a broken saw from the ironwork factory to file away bars on a second-floor window at night, little by little, reattaching them with gum each morning. At last, they squeezed themselves out, scaled a wall embedded with broken glass and fled into the hills.
When she finally walked through the door of her family home in Munsan, she said, her father fainted.
___
""JUST WAITING TO DIE""
The unraveling of Brothers began by accident.
While pheasant hunting, Kim, then a newly appointed prosecutor in the city of Ulsan, heard from his guide about men with wooden bats and large dogs guarding bedraggled prisoners on a nearby mountain. When they drove there, the men said they were building a ranch for the owner of the Brothers Home in nearby Busan. Kim knew immediately, he said, that he'd stumbled onto ""a very serious crime.""
On a frigid January evening in 1987, Kim led 10 policemen in a surprise raid past the facility's high walls, imposing steel gates and gape-mouthed guards. Inside, he found battered and malnourished inmates locked in overcrowded dormitories. The inmates gave the unexpected visitors crisp, military-style salutes.
""I remember thinking, 'This isn't a welfare facility; it's a concentration camp,'"" Kim, now 61 and a managing partner at a Seoul law firm, said. People lay coughing and moaning in a squalid sick ward, ""just waiting to die.""
After the owner was arrested, he demanded a meeting with Kim's boss, the chief Busan prosecutor, who then supervised Ulsan. A day later, Busan Mayor Kim Joo-ho, who died in 2014, called Kim to plead for Park's release. Kim said he politely declined and hung up.
At every turn, Kim said, high-ranking officials blocked his investigation, in part out of fear of an embarrassing international incident on the eve of the Olympics. President Chun Doo-hwan, who took power in a coup after Park Chung-hee was assassinated, didn't need another scandal as he tried to fend off huge pro-democracy protests.
Internal prosecution records reveal several instances where Kim noted intense pressure from Chun's office to curb his probe and push for lighter punishment for the owner. Kim had to reassure presidential officials directly and regularly that his investigation wouldn't expand.
Park Hee-tae, then Busan's head prosecutor and later the nation's justice minister, relentlessly pushed to reduce the scope of the investigation, Kim said, including forcing him to stop his efforts to interview every inmate at Brothers. Park, a senior adviser to the current ruling party, has repeatedly denied AP interview requests. His personal secretary said Park can't remember details about the investigation.
Despite interference, Kim eventually collected bank records and financial transactions indicating that, in 1985 and 1986 alone, the owner of Brothers embezzled what would be the current equivalent of more than $3 million. That came from about $10 million of government subsidies meant to feed and clothe the inmates and maintain the facilities. However, Kim said, the chief Busan prosecutor forced Kim to list the embezzlement as nearly half the amount he had actually found so that a life sentence couldn't be pursued under the law at the time.
Kim said his bosses also prevented him from charging the owner, Park, or anyone else for the suspected widespread abuse at the Brothers compound, and limited the prosecutor to pursuing much narrower abuse linked to the construction site Kim found while hunting.
Kim demanded a 15-year prison term for Park. After a lengthy battle, the Supreme Court in 1989 gave Park 2 years in prison for embezzlement and violations of construction, grassland management and foreign currency laws. He was acquitted of charges linked to off-site abuse. Only two guards received prison terms, one for 1 years and another for eight months.
After prison, Park continued to earn money from welfare facilities and land sales. The Brothers site was purchased in 2001 by a construction company for what would now be about $27 million, according to a copy of the land sale shown to the AP. One of Park's daughters operated a school for troubled kids that closed in 2013. His family in 2014 sold a home for the severely disabled.
___
UNFORGETTABLE PAIN
The legacy of Brothers lingers.
It finally closed its gates in 1988. In the 1990s, construction laborers dug up about 100 human bones on the patch of mountain just outside where it stood, according to one of the workers who found the bones, Lee Jin-seob. Blankets covering the bones and the lack of burial mounds made Lee think they'd been buried informally and quickly. It's unclear what happened to the remains.
On a recent trip to the site, which is now covered with tall apartment buildings, ex-inmates Choi and Lee Chae-sik stood on a concrete-covered former water reservoir that they think is the only remaining physical trace of Brothers. Both recalled the sight of guards carrying corpses into the woods.
""There could be hundreds of bodies still out there,"" Lee said, pointing toward the steep slopes.
Inmates released from the facility ended up homeless and in shelters and mental institutions; many struggle with alcoholism, depression, rage, shame and poverty. Choi, whose back is covered by a large tattoo from his time in a gang after he left Brothers, was imprisoned for assaulting a policeman.
The few former inmates who have begun speaking out want justice: an apology and an admission that officials encouraged police to kidnap and lock away people who shouldn't have been confined.
""How can we ever forget the pain from the beatings, the dead bodies, the backbreaking labor, the fear ... all the bad memories,"" Lee, who now manages a lakeside motel, said. ""It will haunt us until we die"

The Haryana government which earlier had denied that no incident of rape took place in the state during the nine-day Jat agitation on Monday told the Punjab and Haryana High Court that it is investigating two complaints filed by rape victims.
The admission by the Haryana government came up during hearing of a case by the high court on Monday.
Submitting a report by way of an affidavit filed by Inspector General of Police, South Range-cum-incharge, Special Investigation Team (SIT), Mamta Singh said, the state police has included section 376-D (rape) of the Indian Penal Code to the FIR No. 118 registered on March 30 this year regarding the incidents at along National Highway No. 1 (NH-1) near Murthal in Haryana's Sonipat district.
The section (of rape) has been included on the basis of complaint of Delhi resident Bobby Joshi that women were allegedly sexually assaulted by the agitators. The state government said that it had received anonymous letters alleging that the rapes took place.
Reportedly, an Australian woman, a college student and a resident of a prominent east Delhi locality have come forward admitting sexual assault.
Meanwhile, a Chandigarh based NGO, Haryana Human Rights has said it will file a contempt petition against former SIT chief Dr Rajshree as she misled the court and the media.
In February this year, the Haryana government had told the high court that no such incidents of rape or molestation were reported from Sonipat district during the Jat agitation. The government had submitted a status report in the high court in this regard.
The preliminary status report was submitted following investigations into the mass gangrape allegations by an all-women SIT constituted by the Haryana government. The SIT report said that no victim of the alleged mass gangrape or molestation had come forward to complain."

At least 30 people were killed and over 300 injured in the nine-day-long Jat agitation in Haryana.
The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Monday castigated the Haryana Police for suppressing the facts pertaining to the alleged Murthal mass rapes.
In another development the state government - which earlier denied that no rapes were reported during the Jat agitation - admitted to the possibility of rapes during the hearing.
The Haryana government was further embarrassed when the police, which had also earlier denied that no rapes took place during the nine-day Jat agitation, told the court that they were investigating two complaints filed by alleged rape victims.
Submitting the SIT report in the form of an affidavit, Murthal gangrape SIT chief IG Mamta Singh informed the court that the police have included Section 376-D (rape) of the Indian Penal Code to FIR No 118 registered on March 30, 2016.

The section has been included on the basis of complaint of Delhi resident that women were allegedly sexually assaulted by the agitators. The state government said it had received anonymous letters alleging that the rapes took place.
""The anonymous letter forwarded by CP Faridabad vide letter dated March 1, 2016 to SP Sonipat which was further forwarded to Special Group of officers by SP Sonipat on March 2 and the letter from a non-resident Indian forwarded by a news channel on March 2016 was also taken on record.

""Efforts have been made to identify the victim of these two communications. Keeping in view the sensitivity of the matter, utmost care has been taken to keep secret the identity of the victim, if the communication is substantiated, and victim is identified,"" the affidavit added.
So far, three alleged rape victims have surfaced. One of the victims is a final year degree student, who was present on the street along with her father. The second woman who has alleged rape is a resident of Patparganj in New Delhi. She has spoken to amicus curiae Anupam Gupta. The third alleged victim is an Australian woman whose complaint was also forwarded to the police.
The court also questioned the state government on the appointment of the Parkash Singh Committee to look into the incidents of violence during the Jat agitation, asking it to clarify its constitutional and legal status.
""We have been taken for enough rides. We won't be taken for one more. The police only registered FIR after we pulled them. After the court pulled them up, the police have now conditionally accepted the rapes. I have video tapes of Murthal victim's statement,"" Gupta said.
Meanwhile, a Chandigarhbased NGO, Haryana Human Rights has said it will file a contempt petition against former SIT chief Dr Rajshree as she misled the court and the media.
The court, which took a suo motu notice of the reports in the media about the mass rapes, had asked the Haryana government and police to submit a status report. At least 30 people were killed and over 320 injured in the nine-day long Jat agitation for reservation.

(Photo: AP)
One of the suspects in the deadly shooting rampage at a California social service center grew up in a family riven by violence, with his mother accusing his father of being an abusive alcoholic, according to divorce records. Read: Police identify 2 suspects in deadly mass shooting in California
Syed Farook's mother, Rafia Sultana Farook, in 2006 alleged that her husband, also named Syed, attacked her while her children were present, dropped a TV on her and pushed her toward a car, according to the records obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.
She filed a no-contact, stay-away domestic violence protection petition on July 3, 2006. Rafia Farook said she was forced to move out of her home with three of her children because her husband continually harassed her ""verbally and physically and refused to leave the home,"" according to the divorce records.
The Associated Press couldn't immediately reach the father for comment. No one answered at Farook's brother's home, where a neighbor said the father lived.
The details about the younger Farook's childhood emerged as authorities tried to determine what could have motivated him and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, to, as police say, open fire at the center in San Bernardino, killing 14 people and injuring more than a dozen others.
One U.S. official briefed on the investigation said the FBI was treating the shootings as a potential act of terrorism but had reached no firm conclusions.
The official, who was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity, said Syed Farook communicated with individuals who were under FBI scrutiny in connection with terrorism investigations. Also read: San Bernardino shooting: At least 14 killed, 17 injured in California
But the official said the contact was with ""people who weren't significant players on our radar"" and dated back some time. The official also said there was no immediate indication of any ""surge"" in communication ahead of the shooting.
San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said the couple had more than 1,600 bullets when they were killed by authorities, and that the shooters had more than 3,000 rounds of ammunition at their home, as well as 12 pipe bombs and tools that could be used to make explosive devices.
""There was obviously a mission here. We know that,"" said David Bowdich of the FBI. ""We do not know why.""
Muslim leaders in the community said they were unfamiliar with Farook or where he worshipped.
""We don't know the motives. Is it work, rage-related? Is it mental illness? Is it extreme ideology? At this point, it's really unknown to us,"" said Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, based on conversations with Farook's brother-in-law.
Syed Rizwan Farook was born in Chicago in 1987 to parents born in Pakistan. He was raised in California. His job at the county Department of Public Health took him Wednesday to the Inland Regional Center, where the department held a holiday banquet, Ayloush said.
Patrick Baccari, who sat at the same table as Farook at Wednesday's party, recalled he was short on words and inclined to talk about cars, not religion.
A friend of a man killed in the rampage said he and Farook had a heated conversation about Islam two weeks before the attack.
Kuuleme Stephens said she once happened to call Nicholas Thalasinos, a Messianic Jew who was passionate about pro-Israel causes, while he was having a discussion with Farook. Thalasinos, 52, identified Farook by name and told her that he ""doesn't agree that Islam is not a peaceful religion,"" Stephens said.
Stephens said Farook replied that Americans don't understand Islam. According to Stephens, both men worked as restaurant inspectors and regularly discussed politics and religion.
It was unclear how Farook met his wife. He returned from a trip to Saudi Arabia in July 2014 and told co-workers he had been married.
Malik traveled through Islamabad, arriving on a K-1 visa for fiances and with a Pakistani passport. The couple had a 6-month-old daughter, who they left with relatives before heading to the center on Wednesday.
Dane Adams, of Corona, said Syed Farook's father, who moved in with his son, Syed's brother, two doors down a few months ago, was talkative, often visiting as Adams worked on classic cars in the garage. He talked about his family and said he was divorced.
Adams said he often saw the man walking with his grandchild.
""That baby's got the cutest smile in the world,"" he said."

One of his stories focusses on public transportation wherein he has advanced the idea of motorcycle taxis as most solutions currently in vogue are urban centric and very few focus on last mile connectivity.
""Motorcycle taxis could be a possible solution to public transportation in the rural hinterlands, where lack of adequate road infrastructure and economics do not make a case for investments in public transportation.
""Such a taxi service can also be leveraged as part of the multi-modal transportation solution for urban centres to provide effective last mile connectivity,"" he said.
The idea of motorcycle taxis is advanced through the story of a single mother in rural suburbs of Delhi, challenged with her daily commute to and from work. The protagonist comes up with the solution based on her evaluation of what will work best for a person of her socio-economic milieu.
Another story talks about a concept of asset sweating.
Most public infrastructure in India, such as schools, colleges, office buildings are open during the day hours, typically between 9 AM to 6 PM. For the rest of the evening and night, these assets lay idle.
At the same time, there is a strata of Indian society that is unable to undertake entrepreneurial activity for want of suitable operating space.
This concept has been forwarded through the story of a migrant worker who wishes to augment his family income but struggles for want of space to operate from.
The story suggests opening of public infrastructure to entrepreneurs for work and development activities such as needle classes, adult literacy coaching, clinics, alcoholic anonymous support group meetings and women cooperatives.
Another story talks about a partnership agreement between Jammu and Kashmir and Telangana to run dedicated tourist trains, resulting in huge fillip to state economies through increased domestic tourism.
While tourism is a big industry in India, very few from the low income groups are taking to the road except for travelling to religious places and to meet relatives.
The state governments, working hard to attract tourists and revving up their state economies, can play an important role in facilitating travel into their states, Nawal says.
A big expense head in travel is transportation itself, followed by lodging costs. State governments can undertake agreements and run dedicated trains with heavily subsidised tickets for people from the other state to visit them. This will also provide fillip to bed-and-breakfast and entertainment options for all strata of the society.
Such state sponsored tourism will also serve the larger goal of national integration, the story suggests. PTI BJ ABM MKJ"

65,The sisterhood of shared wisdom,[],2015-08-07 12:46:49,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"Women have been called queens for a long time but the kingdom given them isn't worth ruling. Misogyny, sexual harassment, verbal and physical violence and gender bias is a way of life for even India's women of privilege. But for decades women have found a simple way to keep themselves and others afloat during difficult times: the power of advice.
Whether disguised as a funny quote or a nugget of unsettling insight, these pieces of instruction and lived wisdom have been passed from person to person and helped countless women tap into their own source of power. An appreciation: Power is being told you are not loved and not being destroyed by it. Ditch logos: you are not a billboard. Read, listen, learn. Nothing is as cool as intelligence. Exercise. Sweatpants are a sign of defeat. It means you lost control. If you don't know something, ask. There are two kinds of women in the world: the one who want power in the world, and those who want power in the bed.
Whatever your income always buy the best quality you can afford. Train your eye. Train your palate. Poor taste is worse than poverty. Learn from those who have gone before. Whenever possible, stand on the shoulder of giants... You will have 20/20 vision. Wear sensible shoes. Always avoid drama. But if you must, then stick to the Eminem Principle: No more games/ Imma change what you call rage/ Tear this motherfuc**ng roof off like two dogs caged. Only silly women are nice to men and mean to other women. If you take care of your skin you can go years without the need for makeup. Drink lots of water. Alcohol is only meant to celebrate. There is always a good reason to celebrate. Invent your own life. Change is good. Change often. But make an effort to keep old friends because they knew you back then when you knew nothing. Disconnect sometimes; do a pixel detox.
You cannot find peace by avoiding life. Get out in nature. The mountains provide perspective. As does the sea. Respect your mortality. Move. Take the stairs. Be mindful of what you eat. Remember food is fuel, not a drug. Stop sipping the whine at your pity party. Above all, be the heroine of your own life, not the victim. But occasionally give the finger to show your frustration. Laugh. In the end, you know it's all just a crazy cosmic game. You don't get to choose who or what you love. Before you complain about being objectified ensure you are not using any man as an ATM, dead pedal or cat's paw.
These are all objects. Women have turned pretence into an art form. Learn to say no. No is a complete sentence. Never take advice from someone with bad eyebrows. When you are presented with opportunities lean in, but always say yes please, because now you are smart enough to be grateful. If you can read this consider yourself lucky. Give back. There is a special place in hell for women who don't help other women. Create something: a garden, a painting, a baby, a legacy. Leave behind some proof you existed. Try to meet people in person. Be tactile.
Be silly. Stop hiding behind the internet. Stop hiding in general. Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage. Cultivate nonconformity and insouciance. When you make your peace with authority, you become authority. Have some ambition, learn courage. Most of the time tears are pointless. Be financially independent so that you love only for love. Accept the ageing process by simply considering the alternative. Don't have any kind of operation that makes you look like a doll or a statue or a duck. Worklife balance is an urban myth. As these ten women show so well, being a woman is a nice job, if you can get it.

For raising awareness among women on the need for toilets
Because as a 19-year-old bride, Bharti walked out of her husband's home, protesting against the lack of toilet facilities. Despite repeated requests, her husband could not afford to build a toilet inside their house.
Because although her decision created a scandal in Maharajganj village and neighbouring areas, she didn't give in to pressure to return to her marital home. As news spread across the village, Sulabh International officials got involved. To reward her initiative and for having the courage to walk out of her marital home, they felicitated her with an award of Rs 2 lakh and built her a toilet at home.
Because she now travels around Maharajganj, in Uttar Pradesh encouraging other women to build in-house toilets and educating them on the need for sanitation.
Because Rai has become an example of how you can bring about change in society if you only have the courage to speak out. Rai recieved Rs 2 lakh from Sulabh International and had a toilet built in her house after she walked out of her marital home a month after her wedding due to the lack of any toilet facilities.
Because ever since then she has been touring the villages of Kushinagar district in UP teaching basic vocational skills like sewing to village women so that they are able to earn enough to afford an in-house toilet.
Because she understands that sanitation is an important issue that needs to be discussed from the point of view of women's health and hygiene. Rai now travels around her district teaching women how better sanitation can improve their health.

Because being an orphan didn't come in the way of her fulfilling her dreams of going to college and later in life fighting cancer with the same degree of grit and determination. After her parents died in a car accident, Rana not only looked after her younger brother but also managed to build a career for herself in academic research.
Because she viewed cancer as an opportunity to connect with other survivors and now works to create awareness about the social costs of the stigma attached to cancer. Today, she blogs and participates in conferences to voice the concerns of cancer survivors - mainly rising medical costs and a lack of awareness about common symptoms.

Because she never let her battle with cancer come in the way of her professional commitments. ""I went to work every single day after my surgery except for the days when I had to go for chemotherapy. My doctor said occupation therapy would take my mind off my illness. So, when people like to argue that work won't comfort you on your deathbed, I smile and say, ""I would like to differ.""
Because she decided to fight back and not surrender. The journey was all about winning small battles on an everyday basis in order to win the bigger war against cancer in the long run. ""I told myself every morning, even if I happen to lose my looks to cancer, I would be happy to have won the war against this disease,"" Bhanot says.

DILSHAD MASTER
49, Former Chief Operating Officer, UTV, New Delhi
For conquering the battle against breast cancer
Driving home in her father's Ambassador after a theatre dress rehearsal in Bengaluru Dilshad Master, then only 24, was hit by a speeding bus. This was the first time she was admitted to a hospital. ""I have had three major accidents, countless surgeries and two tumours, one of which turned out to be cancerous,"" says Master. Despite the odds, Master has never given up. She has spent 22 years working in the television industry, serving as Chief Operating Officer at UTV Entertainment and Senior Vice President at National Geographic. She has also started her own digital company and travel blog and recently completed a trek to the Everest base camp.
""I remember the first time that I was hospitalised. The entire right side of my body was bruised and bleeding and I was barely in my senses. I had turned to my father then and asked him why this was happening to me? And he said, 'darling, why not you? What is so special about you?' I have never forgotten his words,"" says Master, who currently lives in Delhi with her husband of 17 years and three-year-old daughter, Saira. Saira was only nine months old when Master was diagnosed with stage one carcinoma (breast cancer) in 2012.
""I had been aware of a lump in my breast for nearly eight months but I kept on trying to ignore it. I think that unknown to myself, I was afraid to know the truth. Finally a friend scheduled me for a mammography which was negative but an ultrasound later revealed that there was indeed a lump and it could be cancerous,"" she says. Master then went for a fine-needle aspiration biopsy to Apollo Hospital in Delhi. Thinking back to the exact moment she found out she had cancer she says, ""I was all alone. And I could not understand a word on the report except for the fact that it was positive. It was at that moment that I just knew that there was no option but to overcome the disease. I had a baby and a family and I just decided then and there that I would keep on going.""
And then it got worse. ""The first surgery did not go well at all and was left partially incomplete. But God has a way of sending his angels and I was referred to a brilliant doctor at Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai who completed the surgery,"" explains Master. ""I think it's important to not stereotype the disease and make it all the more difficult for patients. For women in particular, the stigma of being bald needs to be dealt with. The most beautiful thing a woman can ever wear is self-reliance and confidence,"" she adds. Master was recently felicitated at the India Today Woman-Dabur India Brave and Beautiful event, a campaign that aims to spread awareness about cancer.
But despite her determination to never give up, cancer did eventually leave its mark on Master. ""I was just exhausted at the end of all the radiotherapy sessions, surgeries and hospital visits. I found that I no longer wanted to go back to a corporate set-up and put in 16 to 20 hours of work a day. If there was anything that cancer taught me it was to really embrace life and the time you have left,"" she says.
Today Master no longer works in the television industry and spends most of her time pursuing her second love: travel and adventure trekking. She is now working as the Director of Operations and Business Development at her husband's firm, Mercury Himalayan Explorations (MHE). ""MHE has been around for the last 30 years. I have always had a thirst for adventure so it was a natural choice for me to start working with them,"" says Master, who is getting ready for a trek to the Great Lakes in Kashmir this summer. ""You know what, no matter what you do, your body will give up at some point or the other. It is then that the mind will take over,"" she concludes.

ANAR PATEL
44, Social Worker, Ahmedabad
FIRST DAUGHTER OF GUJARAT
When she picked up her brush to depict the first blooms of spring on her canvas in July last year, Anar Patel's painting was lapped up by a Kalol-based builder for Rs 40,000 at a charity auction. In December, she was cajoled into registering as a member of the BJP. At a recent wedding, she was persuaded to move towards the VIP area instead of standing in line with other guests. And when she hosts an exhibition of handicrafts by her NGO Craftroots, Ahmedabad's elite queue up to take home traditional woven creations.
Ever since her mother moved into the Chief Minister's office in Gandhinagar, Anar Patel, 44, has been in the spotlight in Gujarat. Seen as the shortest route to Anandiben Patel's office, she's being wooed by the Gujarati elite with invitations to events and inaugurations. She's a guest speaker that every other business house or institute wants to put on their wish list. Everyone in Gujarat wants to be seen in Anar's company. ""People's perception of me has changed but I am still the same Anar. Power isn't constant in life; you shouldn't lose touch with reality,"" she says.
Before she shot to limelight as the first daughter of Gujarat, Patel was best known for her work in the social sector with underprivileged women, street children and craftsmen. With her husband Jayesh Patel, the couple runs three key NGOs-Manav Sadhna, Gramshree and Craftroots. Their work in the field of community service was recognised in 2001 when the couple spent a year in Bhuj rebuilding a village after the earthquake. They won the Gujarat Puraskar for building a model village-the Gandhi nu Gram with 455 ecofriendly houses, six lakes and schools.
The journey wasn't always easy especially when locals put up stiff opposition to their efforts. ""My mother was a minister then but we lived anonymously. That time marked a spiritual turn in my life,"" says Patel. Even as charges of corruption and human rights violation plague her NGOs, Patel dismisses them as being politically motivated, especially after her mother rose to the top job in the state. ""Shifts in power have the potential to break families and relationships,"" she says. Over the past year, Patel has had to abandon several acquaintances and relatives when she refused to give in to requests ranging from admissions and jobs to government favours. ""We are here to work for society, not for an individual,"" she says.
While her husband has ""zero earnings"" and is dedicated to community service, Patel is an astute businesswoman with a dozen business ventures in the retail sector. Her flagship Anar Projects Ltd runs a mid-size pharmaceuticals company, a consultancy firm and retail ventures. ""We have chosen social work as a way of life but our daughter has the right to choose what she wants so we have to provide for her,"" she says. Last year, she sent her 18-year-old fashion designer daughter to the London School of Fashion to ""keep her away from the power play"" back home. Despite being raised by politician parents, Patel stayed away from politics until December last year when she was inducted into the party. ""In politics, people usually think from the head. But I prefer to think from my heart,"" she says.
With Craftroots, she plans to give the Prime Minister's Make In India campaign a boost. She's already revived the original mashroo, namda and kharad weave art forms and is wooing the younger generation of craftsmen with technological developments and contemporary designs. ""India has 1.5 crore people associated with the crafts industry, although in an unorganised manner. It's a field that encourages entrepreneurship and preserves our cultural heritage,"" she says.
A mantra that Patel swears by is the 3 H- Heart, Head and Hand where you think from your heart, apply your mind and implement your ideas fast. Even as Gujarat waits for the next big role for the Chief Minister's powerful daughter, Patel is taking cautious steps. ""There is no exit policy once you take the (political) plunge. You always want something from power and you believe that the power games you play, are always fair,"" she says. For now, she's happy playing the role of her mother's eyes and ears on the ground. Active politics can wait.

DIYA SETHI
39, Chef and Writer, New Delhi
For daring to own up to her addictions
I was the daughter of the Indian ambassador to Paris, living in a palatial home situated alongside the Eiffel Tower, a four-storey establishment called an hotel particulier. It was the type of house occupied by aristocrats in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. My university, the American University of Paris, scattered amongst various buildings and annexes both old and new, was a short walk away, across the beautiful park that skirted the Eiffel Tower. Between my home and university I lived two brilliant lives, an illusion I established for the world around me but not one that I believed in the graves of my mind and soul, where I hid my secrets and the truth roamed free. I fabricated new personalities to support that illusion, becoming more distant from myself than I had ever been while trying to find the nourishment my ego craved... My apology is to myself, to the child born on August 26, 1974, named Diya, a little one full of innocence and showered with love ? but in 1989, on the eve of turning sixteen, that child was no longer innocent.
She was shameful and when she found herself in danger of being exposed as an anorexic, she adopted the convenient camouflage of bulimia - she became, what is known as, an anorexic-bulimic. I ate when I had to, in public; I ate as little as I could for the purpose of my dangerous game of pretend, all the while plotting my escape to the nearest bathroom. I used two fingers roughly pushed down my throat until I gagged and vomited. And if I sensed anything remaining in my digestive system, I would drink as much tap water as I could to flush it out. Eventually, when my body got used to this routine of punishment following any nourishment, I no longer had to use my fingers. I would merely bend over and my body would be completely submissive to the purging, to the self-flagellation that induced a kind of levitation where I could neither be harnessed nor harmed.
Very soon bulimia evolved into much more than a front that obscured anorexia; it became my primary purpose - to escape my loneliness by foraging for food and to suffocate my feelings by eating indiscriminately. I didn't taste anything I ate, but I would eat feverishly until I could bear no more and was forced to vomit for physical release from the prison of my reality. It has not been underlined sufficiently in literature on eating disorders, or by authorities on the subject, that both the denial and purging of nourishment generate a powerful high. It is the same high that desensitises every addict and it is also the cunning trap of anorexia-bulimia - not the skeletal frame that the disease engenders. No one in the throes of the illness is able to see the real shape of their own body. No one in the throes of the illness is ever thin enough, until perhaps on their deathbed, and in most cases, not even then... I went to the college cafeteria and, indiscriminately, I gathered as much food as I could.
I put some on a tray and hid the rest in my handbag and pockets. I returned to my room where I ate with a punishing force, so violent it nearly choked me. Then I went to the bathroom and vomited, gagged, vomited again and again until I could barely lift my head. When I did, it was back, that lightness of being which silenced the noises in my head and decelerated the beating of my tormented heart..... I could not see that the appreciation by others was maturing into one of a sexual nature... I was introduced to cocaine and then crack.. There was a time when we indulged in the radical abuse of those drugs, when the nights did not end, daylight never came and all boundaries were stretched and broken. But finally, on one of those occasions, the night did end. I was an addict, addicted to an eating disorder and to being wanted and needed.
I was an addict who had prostituted herself in exchange for preservation in a world that was itself a whore of chemicals. It was a world in which love, laughter, celebration and control were hallucinations - they were counterfeit. But I did not permit any sorrow to rise to the surface. I granted myself another decree of shame.... Sethi is the author of The Addict: A Life Recovered HarperCollins India

For having the courage to speak up about depression
For as long as I can remember I've been afraid. My greatest fear: connecting with people. More precisely, the inability to connect with them. Something so easy. Impossible! From the earliest age filling me with terror.
While my cousin or my brother, easy in their skin - fun, funny and smart - knew instinctively what to say, with self-possession, betraying no self consciousness or shyness, I was behind them, crippled, my words crushed in my chest. For fear...of what? Failure, humiliation, being exposed as...empty, strange? I don't even know. But from such an early age. I was doomed. Seeing the world around me, I kept it to myself. I learned to display the surface mannerisms and attitudes of a well adjusted girl.
And I worked diligently, I studied hard, continuing along a well-delineated path toward success, masking any strangeness I felt. But certain ruptures occur in life, revealing a terrifying universe beyond plans. When I was nineteen my father developed a brain tumour. He went for exploratory surgery that was a disaster: it paralysed him. No time to say goodbye to the father I knew. For a year he died slowly at home, full of the same rage I locate within myself. What I'd previously felt as a creeping but manageable strangeness turned into a depression from which I could find no reasonable way out. Two things impressed upon me repeatedly during this period of my life: death was imminent, and the life I had learnt to play along with was suffocating, leading toward another kind of death. At this point I needed to talk to someone, or find an outlet.
Earlier, I might have taken comfort in books, but I needed something living, visceral. To dance, to drink, to have sex, to make mistakes. But this was not an easy thing to do, the space for it in my world was hidden in shadows. I saw shame, suspicion, the need to be spotless, the increased demand for success. Do well in school. Study hard. Get a good job. Marry into a good family. Do the GRE. Go to America. Do not slip up. Do not fail. Achieve. Be a valuable member of society. I became reckless anyway. I lashed out, damaging myself willingly, enjoying myself in the process, damaging myself more in my enjoyment, confronting the need to connect by bypassing normal behaviour, by heading toward oblivion. Yet the need to talk did not diminish. So I went to speak to a psychologist. But he only displayed an exaggerated interest in my sex life, encouraging me to describe acts that had not happened. I left, but not before jokingly suggesting he give me Prozac, to which he very casually said sure, and filled out a prescription.
I was on Prozac for two years. I'm not even sure it worked. At best I felt a numbness that sat atop the numbness I already felt, an incubus, a night hag, a day hag. A fog. I continued to damage myself. I had suicidal days. Three things, I can say now with some distance, saved me, if save is not too strong a word. The first was meeting someone who listened to me, who did not judge, was not ashamed, and was patient while I suffered. The second was yoga, which gave me the physical discipline to control my mind. The third was the desire to use my mind to shape the world creatively, to write. I reduced the Prozac dosage and finally stopped. Aside from having someone who understands, I don't advocate for anything: yoga is not for everyone, Prozac or other medication can be incredibly helpful, essential even, to others. This is my own brief story, and there's no moral to it other than to say these feelings exist, and they're nothing to be ashamed of.

But the fact is, online stalking will not die down.
Two years after her death, Amanda Todd, the teenage Canadian girl who committed suicide because of cyber bullying and harassment, still remained the topic of discussion at the Global Stop Cyberbullying Youth Summit held in Dublin recently. Amanda ended her life barely 15 days after she posted a video on the internet. She was lured and sexually stalked by a social media predator who bullied her into exposing her breasts during an online chat, took the screen shot and began sharing it on the internet. Unable to bear the humiliation, Amanda committed suicide.
Carol Todd, her distraught mother, who is a teacher by profession, now spends time travelling and spreading awareness about the dangers of the internet.
With people spending more and more time in the virtual world, it has become a new source of danger, a new threat that consumes the lives of people, particularly youngsters.
It has been estimated that 75 per cent of individuals being stalked and harassed on the internet are women, followed by kids who are mainly targeted by paedophiles.
How to know if you are being stalked online?
Are you being ''groomed'' by someone? Grooming refers to a series of deceits, lies and false statements made by an individual online to win the trust of a person. If someone is showing excessive interest in you--enquiring about your school, college, workplace and timings-it should set off your alarm bells. Before saying yes to a friend request, have a look at the profile of the person. What kinds of friends he has, what are the communities he has joined and the type of conversations he is making will speak volumes about him. People with low self-esteem are most likely to fall prey to these cyber bullies who make use of flattery to win friends and their trust. Also, if someone is passing mean, lewd comments on your posts and writing derogatory things on your wall, you are a victim of online stalking.
Who can be your stalker?
It can be anyone. A person known or unknown to you. They can broadly classified into three types.
Obsessive followers: A person who obsessively follows you online might be a pervert who has developed a fixation for you. You might not like his advances on the internet, but he is determined to be in your life. Most of these people are sexually starved and they look for vulnerable targets like young boys, girls and emotional women.
Mentally disturbed people: Schizophrenics, psychopaths and loners have found the internet a safe haven to indulge in acts that satiate their mental depravity. They are generally believed to target doctors, married women, and celebrities.
Revenge seekers: They might have taken offence to something their victim did or said at some point of life in the real or virtual world and have now made it their agenda to take revenge online."
68,Chinese hackers may have US defence data,[],2015-06-15 14:27:30,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201506/china_647_061515125845.jpg,"China-linked hackers appear to have gained access to sensitive background information submitted by U.S. intelligence and military personnel for security clearances that could potentially expose them to blackmail, the Associated Press reported on Friday.
In a report citing several U.S. officials, the news agency said data on nearly all of the millions of U.S. security-clearance holders, including the Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency and military special operations personnel, were potentially exposed in the attack on the Office of Personnel Management.
It said more than 2.9 million people had been investigated for a security clearance as of October 2014.
The OPM did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but a senior U.S. official confirmed that U.S. investigators had discovered a separate attack on the OPM that targeted sensitive information about government employees similar to a hacking incident revealed last week.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, could not confirm that the information obtained was from U.S. intelligence and military personnel but did say it was ""a different set of OPM systems and data"" to that of the hack disclosed last week and did involve background data and security clearances.
A source familiar with the investigation said U.S. investigators suspected a similar Chinese link to the other hacking incident.
Earlier on Friday, the White House said it could not confirm another AP report that as many as 14 million current and former U.S. government employees had their personal information exposed to hackers in the other OPM breach.
The government said last week that the records of up to 4 million people had been compromised, making it one of the biggest known attacks on U.S. federal networks. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the investigation was continuing into this breach.
SENSITIVE DATA
The AP report said a form authorities believed to have been accessed in the breach involving the intelligence and military personnel, Standard Form 86, required applicants to fill out deeply personal information about mental illnesses, drug and alcohol use, past arrests and bankruptcies.
The form required the listing of contacts and relatives, potentially exposing any foreign relatives of U.S. intelligence employees to coercion, the report said. The form also required the applicant's Social Security number and that of their cohabitant.
Later on Friday, without referring to the AP report, the Obama administration said it had ordered federal agencies to take extra steps to protect U.S. government computer systems.
""Recent events underscore the need to accelerate the Administration's cyber strategy and confront aggressive, persistent malicious actors that continue to target our nation's cyber infrastructure,"" the White House said in a statement outlining its security measures.
Friday's reports came as President Barack Obama's top national security adviser, Susan Rice, met with a top Chinese military officer, General Fan Changlong, at the White House and stressed the need for the United States and China to narrow disagreements, including on cyber security.
China, which is also at odds with the United States over Beijing's increasingly assertive pursuit of territorial claims in the South China Sea, has rejected as irresponsible any allegations that it was behind the hacking.
The cyber attacks and tensions over the South China Sea threaten to overshadow broader annual U.S.-China talks covering economic and strategic ties between the word's two biggest economies from June 22-24.
U.S. government officials and cyber analysts say Chinese hackers are using high-tech tactics to build massive databases that could be used for traditional espionage, such as recruiting spies, or gaining access to secure data on other networks.
The OPM incident disclosed last week gave the hackers access to a trove of personal information, including birth dates, Social Security numbers, previous addresses and security clearances.
One official said the stolen information would enable an intelligence service to chart out relationships among U.S. government employees and build pictures of individuals and their families, potentially enabling them to figure out ways to target or blackmail people for espionage purposes."

The forum, according to the complaint, summoned SC/ST students to question government policies on the use of Hindi and the ban on cow slaughter.
The decision came after the ministry of human resource development (MHRD) made an inquiry regarding the anonymous complaint it had received on the activities of the Ambedkar Periyar Student Circle (APSC) on the IIT campus.
Prisca Mathew, under secretary to the government of India, wrote to the IIT director in the letter dated May 15,""I am directed to forward herewith a copy of anonymous letter alleging serious complaints received from students, IIT-Madras along with pamphlet issued by Ambedkar-Periyar study circle on the above mentioned subject and to request that comments of the institute may please be sent to this ministry at an early date,"" reported Times of India .
A week later the IIT dean (for students), Sivakumar M Srinivasan sent an email to APSC informing them that they had been ""derecognised"". In the anonymous complainant one of APSC's pamphlets reproducing a speech which criticised the Modi government and its policies was also enclosed.
Now, the members of APSC are protesting against the HRD ministry's action and the IIT's decision to ban their activities since the decision was based only on an anonymous complaint which could have been by the right-wing groups and that they were denied a hearing."

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have barred the much-hyped and equally controversial cheerleaders from interacting with the cricketers during the eighth edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL). But, that didn't deter an IPL cheerleader from revealing her league experience on the social networking website Reddit.
The IPL cheerleader, who chose to be anonymous and went by the moniker IPLCheer, participated in Reddit's AMA (ask me anything) live chat to disclose the experience and hazards of her jobs.
Reddit's AMA that saw popular Bollywood stars Priyanka Chopra and Imran Khan make candid confessions last year witnessed yet another exciting Q&A event with over 500 responses.
""I'm a bit late for this scheduled AMA. But I'm here! I'll try to answer everyone's question. Ask me anything! :)"" the IPL cheerleader began.
Here's a look at some of the interesting revelations by the IPL cheerleader:
Q. How did you went on entering IPL and becoming IPL cheerleader?
A. I'm on a dance contract through an agency in Mumbai. I do background dancing for Bollywood music videos as well. (No, none of them have come out yet) I was thrown into the IPL gig because of my dance background.
Q. Do players hit on you?
A. No, they ignore us for the most part. We're not allowed to talk to each other.
Q. Is there a rule for official party n gathering? Last week in Bangalore I did see a Australian cricketer talking with a bunch of cheerleader for about 20-30 min at bar/pub post game ..funny thing he refused to talk to almost every guy /fan who approached him.
A. I know that one team of girls got to meet the players because they did a commercial together. Aside from that I've been under the impression that all teams and all members couldn't chat up the cheerleaders. But maybe it's different for different teams.
Q. What is the funniest thing you ever saw a cricket fan doing in a stadium?
A. Honestly? I put a blank stare on for the most part when I'm facing the crowd. There's just so many nasty men making kissy faces and taking my picture that I tend to just block it all out. Often I'll lock eyes with some nice people that are smiling and those are the people I'll focus on for most of the game. So I haven't really seen many funny things. If someone genuinely made me laugh though, that would be a welcome thing.
Q. Are you a feminist? What are your thoughts on cheerleading being a means to objectify women as sexual objects and especially in India as a white relic.
A. I am a feminist, and I admit that I am bothered. When I danced in my home country I felt less like that. If you were to watch female dancers on Broadway, regardless of their outfit, you probably wouldn't call them a sexual object. You'd call them a dancer. I went into this contract as a dancer, finding that I'm treated more as a sex object.
I try to be forgiving of human nature so I'm rolling with the punches. I also enjoy what I do regardless. But I wouldn't renew this contract for another year unless things changed.
Q. How often do you get ogled on stadium while dancing? And how do you feel when you get ogled so much?
A. All the time. I hate it.
Q. What is the biggest thing you hate about your job? A few spectators near me were shouting abusive and cheap words at the cheerleaders. How do you cope up with stuff like that?
A. I hate the racism. Why is my team made up of 99 per cent white girls? Why do Indians feel it's ok to dress white girls up in skimpy outfits but they wont let their fellow Indian women do it? It's messed up. But for the most part I can't hear them. The music is loud enough and the accents are thick enough I'm mostly oblivious to the words. This doesn't mean I can't tell that there are some obvious slime-balls behind me. I try my best to ignore them. And I've made a personal rule for myself not to take pictures with fans unless they're women or children. I'm not keen on becoming someone's fap bate for the night.
Q. As we Indians are quite new to seeing cheerleaders, what are few things about cheerleading that you think we don't know, but should know about?
A. We're not all sluts. You might get the odd one or two out there in the world, but the mass majority of cheerleaders I've worked with are perfectly respectable women. I'm currently not working with any sluts, and for that I'm grateful. They tend to cause drama.
Q. Any insider story you might be aware of related to Match Fixing/late Night parties/Any sort of Harassment?
A. I've only heard rumors of fixed matched from people completely unrelated to IPL. Doesn't mean it doesn't happen. Us girls have had parties with just ourselves on a few occasions, but we're not allowed to hang out with the cricketers.
Q. What kind of hotels do they provide? I assumed it was 5 star hotels.
A. The first two games they were more like 1 star hotels. Cockroaches, I saw a rat and rat droppings, it was pretty bad. But we quickly spoke up and realized our manager for that trip had been skimping us and pocketing the money he was saving on a cheaper hotel. Now they're more like 3 star. Perfectly comfortable but not over the top.
Q. What's the alcohol situation like over there? Can you just buy a case of beer and bring it back to your hotel room to drink with your colleagues?
A. Some states are dry so you can't bring alcohol back. But when the states aren't dry, we have brought beer and vodka back to our rooms to celebrate.
Q. You think cricket is a game where cheerleading makes sense? Do you feel the flow of the game lends to cheerleading or does it feel forced?
A. Yeah, I feel cheerleading fits well. The 4s and 6s are the main reason for this, and the breaks give ample time to pump up the crowd and cheer for the team.
Q. It must be very exhausting to dance every 5 or 10 minutes in searing hot weather. What do you do keep energy levels high? What's your diet & training regimen like?
A. The heat gets annoying. I try to embrace it. The energy is just part of the job. We have to appear upbeat even if we're exhausted. I'm a vegetarian, I try to stay away from too many fried foods and too much sugar, but I do enjoy chocolate and an occasional samosa.
Q. What's your regimen like? Do you secretly wish that the batsmen of your team got out faster, so that you wouldn't have to dance so much?
A. No way! The games are always so much more fun if we're winning. It's much more boring to sit in a chair than it is to dance. I wasn't a cricket fan before this, but I am now!
Q. When was the cricket ball closest to you? During a boundary I mean. Are there any experiences with the ball?
A. It's never been really close unfortunately. Sometimes I daydream about it coming right at me and I catch it like a badass before going up and dancing. I'd end the dance with a mic drop with my pom poms and walk off the stage.
Q. As a fellow western woman living in India, not sure how I feel about white cheerleaders at the games. Why not Indian cheerleaders?
A. I agree. I love doing it, but I'd honestly prefer to see at least a mix of Indian women. Sadly there's nothing I can do about that. If I refuse I'd be breaking my contract and they'd replace me with another white girl anyway.
Q. Where do you hail from? How has been your overall experience in India?
A. I'm not saying where I'm from to protect my identity. But I'm from a western country. So far I've been loving India. I might be a rare Westerner in that I love the chaos here. People are living, kids playing cricket in the streets, goats and cows wondering around, people selling fruits and veggies on corners, I love it. It beats the closed off living you'll find in major cities in the U.S. the U.K. or Australia.
Q. Did you ever have plans to study at University? What would you like to study if you got a chance?
A. I'm a University graduate. I studied anthropology.
Q. IPL or Superbowl?
A. IPL. I just don't care for American football. It has always bored me."
71,No country for old rum,[],2015-04-17 10:35:40,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201504/kerela-bars-apr27-1_650_041715094255.jpg,"On an overcast Sunday afternoon, a few miserable Malayali men are pecking at salted peanuts and Beef Dragon in an air-conditioned bar, washed in twirling, lurid pink and green light, in a small town in Thiruvananthapuram district. Most of them have a red beer bottle in front of them: Kingfisher Strong. But Vijay Mallya's King of Good Times is not good enough here. They would rather have their usual: Jawan, a cheap rum that used to cost about Rs 40 a peg, or OPR as Old Port Rum is known in the drinker's dictionary. They would rather be sipping a Mansion House, the slightly pungent ""French brandy"" from Maharashtra-based Tilaknagar Industries, or a Bacardi White Rum.
""What can I do? There's no place to sit and have my brandy in peace,"" says a 42-year-old businessman, who loves his Morpheus XO, but is now reduced to incredulously staring at and despondently choosing from a cabinet of Sula wines, Villa 69 ports and Kingfisher beers in Doubloon. It used to be a bar, but now the Kerala government lovingly calls it a Beer and Wine Parlour.
After a division bench of the Kerala High Court ratified the government's new liquor policy on March 31, only 24 five-star bars in the state serve whisky, brandy, rum or any other hard liquor. Most of the 730 bars have been turned into beer and wine parlours where no one cares about the fine distinction between a Shiraz and a Cabernet Sauvignon: they are all Sula Red and are often unceremoniously poured into a mug of Kingfisher or Budweiser for a more potent kick. This is the first step to getting ""fit"", that incongruous term, which every Malayali subliminally understands, means to get sloshed.
While Thiruvananthapuram district has six bars, five districts, including Palakkad, Wayanad and Thrissur, have none. If the Morpheus-loving businessman wants to have his drink, he will have to travel more than 40 km to the Taj Vivanta in Thiruvananthapuram and sip a small peg (30 ml) in a fine balloon snifter for Rs 275. In a two-star bar, he used to have a 60 ml for about Rs 100. Otherwise, now, he will have to wait in line for 20-30 minutes before the dingy retail outlets of the government's Beverages Corporation (Bevco). ""I don't want to stand in sun and rain to buy a bottle. What do I do with a bottle? I just want to have a peg or two comfortably. But the government cannot allow us even that,"" he says. ""Come to think of it, Dubai is better than Kerala.""
A bar owner says: ""The locals don't want wine and beer. Our business is down 70 per cent. I invested Rs 5 crore in this establishment over five years. Now I am struggling to pay interest on the loan I took. Earlier we used to sell 10 cases (each case has 9 litres) of Jawan a day. Now we sell 3-4 bottles of wine and some more beer.""
Elsewhere, in Kollam district, a bar owner, Shine S., had sunk Rs 6.75 crore on his bar hotel so that it would get a three-star rating and a liquor licence. He revamped his grimy little bar into a plush restaurant with a banquet hall and even a swimming pool. ""I opened my new bar on March 4 last year and it got shut down on March 31. I couldn't even pay the interest for the bank loan. I had to sell property worth Rs 2.25 crore,"" he says. ""Finally it opened as a wine and beer parlour in January this year. But the sale is down to one-fifth of what it was a year ago. The locals have beer since there is nothing else but that is not what they want,"" he says. His regulars used to ask for ""Johny"". No, they did not mean Johnnie Walker. It was a code for any cheap rum, brand no bar.
POLITICS IN THE BOTTLE
What's so wrong with having a drink in a bar? Kerala Congress President V.M. Sudheeran, the new messiah for prohibition, earlier told INDIA TODAY: ""If something is not good for the people, the government should not encourage its sales.""
It was the political equivalent of a drunken brawl between Sudheeran and the party's own Chief Minister Oommen Chandy that ended up in this farcical, part ban on bars. When Sudheeran painted the government as a supporter of the liquor lobby, the CM turned the tables on him in August 2014 by announcing, out of the blue, that the 700-odd bars would be closed down immediately and the Bevco outlets would be shut in a phased manner so that Kerala would be alcohol-free by 2023.
The matter then went to the courts. The owners of four-star hotels have appealed to the Supreme Court against the discrimination in the government policy. Advocate Harish Vasudevan says, ""There is no proper justification for this policy that allows certain bars to function. Why shouldn't the poor drink in a bar? Also, by immediately closing down the bars, an entire business is in jeopardy. There are people who have invested money. There are workers dependent on it. The policy is unreasonable and unscientific.""
The closure of bars also uncorked the bribe genie from the bottle. The Chandy government faced one of its biggest tests when hotelier Biju Ramesh alleged in October that Finance Minister K.M. Mani took Rs 1 crore from bar owners to renew licences, following which the Vigilance & Anti-Corruption Bureau registered a case against him. The allegations have grown more serious now, with Ramesh alleging that three ministers-Excise Minister K. Babu, Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala and Health Minister V.S. Sivakumar-and Mani's son and MP, Jose K. Mani, also took bribes.
Ramesh says, ""The government will try to drag the investigation until the end of its term in 2016. If a central agency takes over, the truth will come out and many big names, including Chandy, will be in trouble. But now even a proper interrogation of witnesses is not being done.""
Babu pooh-poohs the allegation and says he is going to file a case against Ramesh.
A bar owner, on condition of anonymity, says there could be some truth in Ramesh's allegations. ""I paid the Kerala Bar Hotel Association Rs 1 lakh in April last year. They said it was for legal and other expenses after the bars got closed. However, I suspect it went to minister Mani.""
A PEG OF FARCE
Meanwhile, the pretensions of prohibition have become a big public farce in the state. Liquor is available in the 300-odd Bevco outlets and 30-odd elite clubs, apart from five-star hotels. Wine and beer parlours are in every corner and there are more than 4,000 toddy shops.
The Taj Vivanta in the capital city has seen a 20 per cent increase in its bar sales after the closure of the four- star bars on March 31, says General Manager V.K. Prasad, ""The clientele of the high-end four stars come here. It has been good for us business-wise.""
The Bevco outlets see roaring business. While the first batch of 418 bars were closed on March 31 last year as these were ""substandard"", the Bevco clocked record sales of Rs 9,996 crore in 2014-15 compared with Rs 9,350 crore in 2013-14. While this could be partly attributed to increased taxes- the tax on IMFL was raised from 115 per cent to 135 per cent and on beer and wine from 50 per cent to 70 per cent in September- the volumes have not fallen drastically. In the two weeks since March 31 this year when the next batch of 312 bars also closed down, a Bevco outlet in Thiruvananthapuram city saw its daily sales jumping from an average of Rs 8 lakh to Rs 11 lakh.
Writer N.S. Madhavan says, ""Now that the figures have come, the bar policy can undoubtedly be termed an utter failure. There is no reduction in drinking. Pious platitudes about abstinence were just a facade; the government was never serious about it. Had they been so, they should have curtailed the production of the most popular brand sold through Bevco outlets -Jawan, produced by none other than the Government of Kerala.""
Unlike popular perception, Malayalis are not the biggest tipplers in the country. According to the National Sample Survey Office's 2011-12 figures, its latest, on liquor consumption, which were detailed in The Hindu, Kerala stands 12th on the list of per capita consumption of toddy, country liquor, beer, foreign liquor and wine, with 196 ml a week. The list is topped by Dadra and Nagar Haveli with 3,031 ml and, among the big states, by pre- Telangana Andhra Pradesh with 665 ml a week. In the consumption of beer, wine and foreign liquor, Kerala is tied ninth, with Karnataka, on the list, with a per capita weekly consumption of 102 ml. Daman & Diu tops that list with 1,079 ml.
A top-down ban is not the solution to Kerala's drinking problem. There has to be awareness programmes. Minister Babu says a programme called Subodham will be launched on April 19 to discourage people from drinking. There should also be counselling and rehabilitation centres for alcoholics.
""Years of hypocritical and restric- tive liquor policy is turning Kerala into a sick society. More and more Malayalis are drinking just to get drunk,"" says writer Madhavan.
BAR CODE
""BAR"", written in black or red on white, was the most common signage, along with ""Kallu"" (toddy) written in Malayalam, along the highways of Kerala. And these signs came, in the 1980s, with the delightful addendum: AC Attached. Drunken Malayalis were arguably among the first to enjoy the pleasures of air conditioning in the state. This was thanks to a weird clause that to procure liquor licence in the state, an establishment should have a two-star standard, which meant it should have 10 rooms of which three should be air-conditioned. It also had to have a restaurant and a ""bar hall"".
While the restaurant is meant for families, the bar hall is understood to be exclusively for men. Bars are among the most classist and sexist spaces in Kerala. If a woman enters a bar, heads would turn and she will be politely told that the restaurant is upstairs. In the winding queue before Bevco, you will never spot a woman waiting to buy a Scotch. She will have to find sanctuary in a five-star bar. The sanctimonious sermon of Sudheeran that the closing down of bars will be a boon for women who suffer from drunk husbands never considers the fact that a woman would want to drink. The good Malayali woman, in his book, doesn't drink.
""I don't understand the logic that the closure of bars is meant to help women. If women should be rescued from drunk husbands, there should be help lines for them and open debate on family finance,"" says writer and historian J. Devika.
Most hotels have two bars: one cheaper than the other. The entrance of the cheaper bar will be separate, a little away from the main doors, so that the poor and the working class who go there for their daily booze will not dirty the pretty carpets and flooring and sully the fine middle-class sentiments of families having their fried rice and chilli chicken.
In God's Own Country, bars are many things. Now that they are gone, Malayali men have the darnedest complaint: ""Drinking so much wine and beer is not good for our health,"" complains a technician. ""We will all become diabetic because, you see, there is so much sugar in it and we have to drink so much to get a kick. And soon all Malayali men will have beer bellies."" Hic!

Yet another wasted life, stripped of personality, struck down in the most productive years. A face among at least 120 million others, enough to fill a state the size of Maharashtra. They navigate through jagged decades of health and work, tormented by troubled moods and disturbed brains, alternating between full-blown agitation and wakeful lucidity, causing heartbreak to their loved ones and challenges to their doctors. Does the nation care?
Yet they are at the tip of a depression iceberg, a tiny speck within a much larger universe. ""Depression is hugely under-recognised. Just 10 per cent people come to us, 90 per cent suffer without ever getting the help they need,"" says Dr Rajesh Sagar, professor of psychiatry at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, and secretary, Central Mental Health Authority. ""Many are misdiagnosed,"" he explains. ""A lot of patients come with fat files full of reports and prescriptions,"" he adds. ""They move from doctor to doctor, looking for answers. And many others are clueless about their condition.""
Wake-up call
It's a wake-up call for the land of happy. India routinely scores high on happiness surveys. In the 2014 Happy Planet Index, it ranks fourth out of 151 countries for delivering long and happy lives to its citizens. The economy is looking up: balance of payments is improving, current account and fiscal deficits are shrinking and inflation is coming down. Over 64 per cent Indians are happy with their jobs and work-life balance, reports a 2014 Monster Salary Index.
Yet the upbeat nation hides a terrible secret: the malady of melancholy, that happens for no apparent reason, hijacks the brain, eats away at personality and snuffs out lives. ""For clinical depression, one must have five or more of the 10 symptoms laid down by the International Classification of Diseases of the World Health Organization (WHO) for over two weeks,"" says Dr Y.C. Janardhan Reddy, professor of psychiatry at NIMHANS in Bengaluru. These can range from depressed mood to recurrent negative thoughts to significant changes in sleep, behaviour, weight or appetite. A major symptom is anhedonia or losing interest in hobbies, people, work- even food and sex. Measured in 'DALY' (Disability Adjusted Life Year or years of healthy life lost to premature death or disability) depression was the fourth leading cause of disease burden in 1990. By 2020, it will be the second most prevalent medical condition in the world, says the WHO.

Death. Depression. Divorce. Three morbid words went hand in hand for me. The divorce procedures went on for a decade. It left me acutely depressed and that in turn impacted my health. My body bore the worst of it, as I became fat and huge. It wasn't as if I hadn't tried losing weight. But every time I got a bad order in court, a complete disconnect occurred between my brain and my hand, reaching out for the cookie jar. I was tired and lethargic all the time. And frankly I did not give a damn about what I ate or how my body looked. One of the prime manifestations of depression is not looking after yourself physically. It wasn't just that. My concentration was sliding, my ability to work bordered on zero, if not negative, and my desire to live-at rock bottom. I couldn't understand why I felt this way. I'm actually glad that it is difficult to get a gun in India otherwise I shudder to think what I would have done.

I have had diabetes since I was young. One would have thought that's enough. But then came depression, the last nail in the coffin. I had come to India from Australia, to set a relationship right. But it didn't work out. Heartbroken, I did all those crazy things that all badly hurt men do: drinking myself to death to find solace. But when you lose your job, they become your monsters. And you finally admit that depression has struck. I was always semi-active, hitting the gym twice a week. But this time, I started dedicating two hours every day, apart from cycling, swimming and reading lots of positive books. I became very conscious of my diet, stayed away from sugar and junk food, until I rebuilt my body. I needed something to prove myself, for people to recognise me. My diabetes has also come down. Right now, I am doing a TV film for Channel V. I am happy now.

Depression comes without warning. And before you know what's happening, you are already in its grip. I went through a cycle of severe depression after a failed relationship. I understood it was over but I didn't know how to work through the loss, move past the anger and take back my life. And I got sucked into a classic case of what's called anhedonia in psychiatry, the inability to experience joy. I had no appetite to speak of, lost weight dramatically, my memory was like a sieve, my self-esteem reached a nadir, my immunity was compromised and I started falling sick too often. I had also started drinking heavily. Friends and family members took me to several doctors but nothing worked. That's when I discovered Vipassana meditation. It was just about the most amazing experience of my life. It taught me to watch everything around, including myself, as an observer. I came away feeling I had found a new kind of happiness, deeper than the kind I'd always pursued. My depression gave me the best time to change my life for the better, inside out.

Depression cost me one marriage and my job. It also meant three years of sleeping an hour a night, with two children, aged 1 and 4, losing the ability to drive, not knowing right from wrong, losing my memory, having zero impulse control, being belligerent to everything and having chaos in every sphere of life. There have been days when I couldn't get out of bed to eat (once four days at a stretch) or shower (once in five days). When I'm in one of those phases, I prefer being around strangers on Twitter, sending one message every four minutes. It's a huge relief and escape from a bad day. Part of my treatment is creating a routine so that my brain gets comfortable with the idea. That's when I took to crochet: it's repetitive, it's colourful and therapeutic.
No one is immune
""Money, youth, success, talent, nothing safeguards against depression's grip,"" says Dr Ashit Sheth, consultant psychiatrist with Bombay Hospital & Medical Research Centre, Mumbai. Every day in his chamber in Marine Drive, 15-20 people of varying age and background seek treatment. On a given day, the range is astonishing: a wealthy young man caught in family conflict, distressed and unable to function in his business (""I try to be nice to everyone. Nobody understands me""); an elderly man who tried to jump from the 11th floor, and saved by his son in the nick of time; a bright student of 10th standard, brought in for her mind-wracking fear of exams; a young MNC executive, who worked relentlessly hard, without a break, for three years, listless and fatigued now, unable to enjoy anything in life; a young divorcee, with a child, who finds it hard to drag herself out of bed and sustain any job beyond six months; a young law student, who has come back from her university in Canada, unable to bear the alienation and solitude of a new environment. ""People from affluent sections of society have very low threshold,"" Dr Sheth says. ""They haven't suffered too much and can't cope when faced with the realities of life.""
Depression, like its victims, is not one entity but a spectrum. Consider this: about 10-20 per cent Indians are found to have clinical depression. Let's include the wide range of other mental disorders that enhance the risk of depression-bipolar disorder, dementia to schizophrenia-and afflicts 2-3 per cent Indians. Add to it untreated emotional distress in the community at large: up to 10 per cent. Then there are the ""medically ill""-with heart disease, cancer, diabetes or arthritis-up to 50 per cent of whom go through profound grief and depression (heart disease and diabetes raise depression risk three-fold). There is also ""chronic low-grade depression"" or dysthymia, that according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, stands for ""depressed mood"" that lasts through the day for at least two years. It's one of the most commonly encountered psychiatric ailments in day-to-day practice, affecting one in 20 people. Sometimes, dysthymic disorder exists along with major depression in three per cent of the population as ""double depression"".
I give up
There is more to the story. Every four minutes, someone commits suicide. If that's a young life, below 30, then it is the second most common way to die in India today, four times more typical than it was a decade earlier. ""Out of a hundred who take their own lives, 90 would have had a mental disorder at the time of death and 75 little reason other than depression,"" says Dr Samir Parikh, director, Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences at Fortis Healthcare, Delhi. The burgeoning numbers point to the coming scourge. And tragic stories of people who succumb to their inner demons haunt every city.
Mumbai, the Maximum City, has one eye always cocked on the next big thing. And South Mumbai is the jewel in its crown: the richest parliamentary constituency of the country, with the highest concentration of millionaires. Exactly a year ago, 800 people gathered for a funeral in one of its tony localities, causing a major traffic gridlock. They had come to celebrate the memory of Dipti, 32. A vibrant and charismatic woman, in the grip of a mind-numbing depression she had believed she was all alone. They had loved her for her quick smile and bright eyes. And she had thought she was fat and ugly, eternally starving herself on cucumber and olive oil. They had valued her exuberance. And she had plumbed the depths of despair in her alone-time. They had never understood why someone could be miserable despite having it all. She had called it quits to escape the torment of her flawed brain-the neuro-chemical storm of malfunctioning chemicals-that subsumed her in waves of inexplicable sadness, without warning or alert.
If suicide is one way of estimating depression's spread, consumption of medicine is another. One of the biggest markets for pharmaceuticals is the antidepressant market, globally as well as in India, thanks to the explosion it has witnessed since the 1990s when Prozac came into the global market. The US accounts for three-quarters of the world's $16-billion antidepressant market. In India, antidepressant use has been rising steadily over the past decade: from a market size of Rs 136 crore in 2001, it is now worth Rs 855 crore, and growing at 12 per cent a year, according to AIOCD AWACS, a pharmaceutical market research organisation.
Disease of loneliness
In a shadowy corner of the internet, anonymous young men and women are coming together since 2013 to share with each other their saddest secrets-heartbreak to crises at work-on India's first emotional networking site, SharingDard.com. The idea of launching the site came to four IIT students once they found that the phrase ""I am lonely"" is searched 46,000 times a day on an average in India.
Little lives of little people don't always make a splash. In January 2015, the headlines did get one's attention: ""Deepika Padukone Speaks About Personal Battle With Depression"". Bollywood's top actress talked about waking up one morning in 2014 ""feeling different"", the ""strange emptiness"" that stalked her, forcing her to seek psychiatric treatment: ""The most common reaction is, 'How can you be depressed? You have everything going for you.' But it's not about what you have or don't have.""
""It's about urban loneliness,"" says social psychologist Ashis Nandy. ""The more cluttered our lives are with work, information, entertainment, technology and other trappings of worldly success, the less we have room for authentic intimacy, sharing of life's challenges with those who really care."" Until recently, the extended family and neighbours used to act as emotional buffers, he explains. Today, our cities are more crowded, yet more people live alone in our cities. Divorce rate is rising. There are more single person households. More people have fewer children. Work or education take us further away from our families and communities. ""We constantly navigate between the need to be on our own and with others,"" he says. Over time, relationships thin out. Driven by the 'cult of busyness' we work more, sleep less, and allow technology to become the prime architect of our intimacies, writes Sherry Turkle, MIT professor of social studies of science and technology, in her 2011 book, Alone Together: Why We Expect More From Technology And Less From Each Other. But loneliness can also act on our stress hormones, immune system, our heart, change our behaviour. Loneliness is also a known factor for suicide.
Fragile youth
In room number 4090, on the fourth floor of AIIMS Teaching Block, a 22-year-old is flipping through her diary. Dr Manju Mehta, professor of psychiatry, looks on. That diary is an essential part of her treatment: Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), a psychological therapy where doctors try to change the grip of rigid thinking, especially automatic negative thoughts, on depressive patients. The young woman came to Dr Mehta, listless and heartbroken, after a failed romantic relationship. There was more: intense pressure from her patients to get married. ""Through CBT, we have to reduce her anxiety, strengthen her sense of worthlessness and build confidence,"" says Dr Mehta. ""The question of drugs comes later. She may or may not need it."" For now, the young woman has to maintain a diary, jot down the situations she faces every day and solutions for those. ""For instance, how she has to explain to her mother that she is not ready for marriage. That she has to learn."" Dr Mehta also recommends ""lifestyle management"", as inadequate sleep and lack of physical activity can change one's metabolic system and push one towards depression.
The vulnerability of the youth to depression and suicide makes Dr Samir Parikh worry. Since 2000, when he started practice, he has been working closely with schoolchildren. With the support of his hospital, he has been continuously surveying them, especially in schools around Delhi, to find a measure of the problem. Based on the surveys conducted in the past few years, he has found significant levels of depressive symptoms amongst the youth: from low mood to self-harm to suicide ideation. ""In a survey among adolescents aged 13-19 in 2012, 45 per cent teenagers with symptoms of depression reported using alcohol or drugs to deal with their feelings,"" he says. When quizzed, 75 per cent teens had complained about rampant bullying in schools as a major stressor. ""Research shows link between bullying and depression on teen mood and self-esteem,"" he adds.
Science of sad
Surprisingly, scientists know startlingly little about why depression occurs. ""It's not just one brain area. Depression affects multiple areas of the brain. And that makes it hard to pin it down,"" explains neurobiologist Sumantra Chattarji, who runs the Centre for Brain Development and Repair at the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) in Bengaluru. Brain-imaging studies show depressed people display abnormally low activity in the prefrontal cortex, at the front of the brain, involved in judgement, planning and decision-making. The right half of prefrontal cortex, involved in establishing negative feelings, shows the greatest signs of weakness in depressed people. ""The emotional hubs of the brain, especially hippocampus in mid-brain, actually shrink in volume,"" he points out. ""It regulates emotions, moods, and memory."" The three neurotransmitters that are important in mood regulation-dopamine, norepinephrine, and especially serotonin-show unusually high activity in depressed patients. ""In depression, the 'talking' that takes place between molecules, neurons, nerve networks in different areas of the normal brain goes out of balance,"" he says.
What about the argument that depression can also be genetic? ""We know that for major depression, environmental factors, say negative life events and inability to cope with that stress, are hugely important,"" says Chattarji. But there's also some contribution from genetic factors, it is believed. In clinical practice, doctors often come across patients where there is a distinct line of depression, suicide or bipolar disorder running through one side of the family or other. ""So a genetic component does seem likely, although we haven't really been able to come up with a list of genes that are closely linked to depression,"" he says.
As a result, the 'silver bullet' approach to design depression drugs has failed. Beyond Valium in the 1970s and Prozac in the 1990s, the science of blockbuster drugs has been largely stagnant. But with scientific advances such as genetic testing, sequencing and editing, the complex biology underlying depression is being rapidly understood. It's not just technology. New theories are also coming up. Scientists are probing if depression is a symptom and not a disease: what if it's the result of inflammation caused by the body's immune system? Inflammation is known to zoom during depressive episodes. A new buzz has started as evidence stacks up. To some, the inflammation is caused by parasitic, bacterial or viral infection (Biology of Mood & Anxiety Disorder, November 2014) while others point to diets (rich in trans fats and sugar), obesity and stress (especially loneliness) as possible causes that can set off inflammation and switch the brain on sick mode. According to industry digest NeuroPerspective, new medicines for severe depression could reach the market within the next few years.
Happiness project
It was not any 'incident' that plunged her into depression. Nor did anyone in her family suffer from it. She was in Class XI when she realised that something was wrong with her. ""Awfully wrong. I could not sleep, started avoiding people and even stopped taking care of myself. A perpetual gloom hung over me,"" recalls 29-year-old Aakriti Kashyap, a software engineer with an MNC in Chandigarh.
Although she used to complain constantly about her condition even as a child, her parents never took her seriously. ""Like everybody else in this country, my businessman father and homemaker mother played doctor and blamed me for it,"" she says. ""Sadly, they still think all one needs is will-power to overcome depression.""
Kashyap first went to a psychiatrist at Chandigarh's Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) as a first-year engineering student in 2005. Things had worsened by then. Sleep evaded her; she would cry without reason. ""I just could not understand what my professors said in class, although I was always a good student."" Kashyap still recalls what the doctor had told her the very first day: ""It's a disease. It may not be cured but it is highly treatable."" Words she was waiting to hear for years.
A decade later, she is still on medication, has a ""normal work and play balance"", and still consults the same doctor. ""He has given me a second life. I have to take medication all my life and always be ready for some days that would not be very bright, despite taking the pills."" Her only regret is that she wasn't diagnosed sooner: ""It would have saved me so much torture.""
No. Depression cannot be cured. But it can be treated well and managed well. That is the message from doctors. But there's more hope than meets the eye: every doctor reports a new mindset among people they see, a cultural paradigm shift, that's making people come out with their problems. There is also great advance in medical technology. ""New drugs, with fewer side effects, are now available. They are very effective if prescribed and monitored right,"" says Dr Sagar. ""Earlier we used to get unmanageable patients, brought in years after their diseases had taken root,"" says Dr Sheth. ""Now the number of hospital in-patients has come down, as has the number and frequency of electric shock treatment."" CBT, although time-consuming, works wonders for depressive patients. Armed with psychological testing, profiling, psychotherapy, hypnosis to relaxation training and group therapies, relief for patients is real and tangible.
Does India care?
India does not have enough doctors: there's a shortfall of 8,500 psychiatrists, 6,750 psychologists, 22,600 psychiatric social workers and 2,100 psychiatric nurses. The nation has not even bothered to find out how many people actually suffer from mental illness in more than six decades of Independence. It's only with the WHO labelling the country as the ""most depressed nation"", with a 36 per cent depression rate, that alarm bells have started to sound. Calling the report mistaken, India has now started its first survey across the country.
The country did not have an officially approved mental health policy-even on paper-as recently as October 2014, when the first such policy was launched: to provide access, reduce stigma and suicides. The Mental Health Care Bill, which aims to protect the rights of patients, continues to get scuttled in Parliament. The government allocates less than a tenth of a per cent of its health budget-one of the lowest globally as a percentage of GDP-on mental health. What will it be now, with the 20 per cent cut to the health budget announced in December 2014?
It's not just India. Psychiatric disorders are rising across the world. The more cities grow, higher will be their share of the disease pie. Cities are lonely zones. They breed psychiatric maladies. With the next wave of urbanisation slated to take place in India by 2050, loneliness and its collateral damage, depression, may just become the catch-all word for all urban angst in that distant future."

Britney remained friends with John after their romance ended but were said to have reignited their relationship last summer.
Pop star Britney Spears is left ""devastated"" after her former lover and a hero pilot, who helped her quit booze, has been killed by the Taliban in Afghanistan.
John Sundahl's helicopter was shot down near Kabul where he had been working for several months as a private contractor ferrying officials across the war-torn country.
The 44-year-old's brother Karl said: ""It's heartbreaking - John went there to try to repair the country.
Britney, 33, dated John in 2007 after they met at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in Los Angeles and she has credited him with helping her beat her drink problems, the mirror.co.uk reported.
They remained friends after their romance ended but were said to have reignited their relationship last summer.
A source close to Britney, who has sons Jayden James, 8, and Sean Preston, 9, with ex-husband Kevin Federline, 36, said: ""She is devastated. Britney thought he was a lovely man.""
Speaking from his home in Los Angeles, his brother Karl told how John died.
""John was on a journey from Kabul when he was shot at and killed. We were told by the State that John had died, they told us the Taliban did it. This is just awful. My family are heartbroken, my parents are elderly so this is very tough for them, and all of us. We know Britney's upset too.
""John was still good friends with Britney, he talked to her regularly. They dated for a while but always kept in touch afterwards,"" the Mirror quoted him as saying.
John's body was repatriated to the US last week and a small family funeral was held at a Buddhist temple in LA."
74,Rise of the D.I.Y. jihadi,[],2015-01-17 21:15:32,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201501/cs-freelance-terror-jan26-1_650_011615085852.jpg,"Syed Abdul Karim Tunda apparently had a grievance. Several actually. The carpenter from Pilkhuwa in Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad district was witness to a series of Hindu-Muslim riots in Ahmedabad and Mumbai in the early 1980s and even saw a relative and three other Muslims being burnt alive. That was supposed to have pushed the man, who was then in his late 30s, across the threshold. He decided to avenge the injustice and wage jihad. He learnt Arabic, sought to radicalise young Muslim men and experimented with making crude bombs but had to wait almost a decade before he could join hands with Laskhar-e-Taiba (LeT) and enter the big league of organised terrorism.
In 2002, when a bunch of disparate, young Muslim men from Kolkata, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka, nursing a range of slights and angered by the communal riots in Gujarat that year, wanted to speak their mind and respond with violence, they had to join hands and form what would go on to become the dreaded Indian Mujahideen (IM). Their presence, however, would not be felt until 2007, the year that saw them launching a series of bomb blasts across the country and killing scores of people.
But last year, it was an entirely different experience for Hyderabad software engineer Munawad Salman, 30, and his three friends. Within months of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) making international headlines, the four men were drawn to it through social media networks and decided to join the group. They made plans to fly out of Hyderabad and join the ranks of ISIS before they were tracked and detained by the state police.
Ditto for Shah Mudassir and Shoeb Ahmed Khan of Maharashtra. Said to be the owners of multiple social networking accounts, the young men allegedly wanted to establish an Islamic state in India and, for this purpose, wanted to travel to Afghanistan and get trained by the al Qaeda. They wanted to learn bomb-making and had gone to Hyderabad to meet a financier who had promised to get them a visa for Afghanistan. Unfortunately for them, Hyderabad police got a whiff of their alleged plans and managed to nab them.
Areeb Majeed, 24, and his three friends from Kalyan near Mumbai were 'luckier'. They managed to fly to Iraq and realise their wish to join the ISIS in May last year, barely weeks after the outfit had announced its arrival and taken control of parts of northern Iraq.

In the brief history of terrorism in India, Munawad Salman, Shah Mudassir, Shoeb Ahmed Khan, Areeb Majeed and their friends represent a new generation of wannabe extremists. They may be children of the digital era but they too have grievances, genuine or perceived, and crave to give violent expression to them. They are aware, connected and much more skilled and educated than Tunda was at a similar stage in his life, and are in a hurry to execute their sinister goals. They will not wait for a terror group to spot and train them. They will find the group or mentor of their choice, establish contact online and figure out what they need to learn to unleash mayhem, even willing to travel to the world's most dangerous terror hotspots-Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Syria-to acquire the skills they think they need.
Security agencies and terror experts have more than one tag for them-""lone wolf/wolves"" is a favourite and has gained momentum in the aftermath of the Sydney caf attack and the Charlie Hebdo carnage in Paris. Some agencies also liken these heinous acts to a loose, franchise model of terror while others prefer to describe it as ""retail terror"" or ""freelance terrorism"". The nomenclature may vary but there is unanimity about the fact that the ogre of terrorism has mutated and spawned a new model- one that is centred around making spectacular impact for the perceived larger cause than identifying with the niche ideology of an organisation and living and acting by its rules.
""The implications of this shift to freelance terrorism are profound,"" Professor Azeem Ibrahim, a research fellow at the International Security Program, Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, had written way back in 2008, when the West had begun to get a whiff of the trend. ""Freelance radicals can move across borders easily, disband and regroup at will and can be coordinated remotely. Inspiration and know-how can be disseminated, and plans formed, online between radicals who need not even have met. But the crucial difference is that any given terrorist can be replaced with another. That means any terrorist group cannot be conclusively defeated.""
Although India woke up to this new threat in the last year or so, an Indian connection to the trend, and a serious one at that, was traced a year before Ibrahim's chilling warning.
In June 2007, a 28-year-old engineer born to doctor parents in Bengaluru tried to ram an explosives-laden jeep into Scotland's Glasgow airport and died of his injuries in the failed attempt. Investigators found that the man, Kafeel Ahmed, was not linked to any terror outfit nor had he trained with any. His family had lived in Iran for four years and Saudi Arabia for 11. Kafeel went to Cambridge in 2004 to pursue a PhD in computational fluid dynamics at Anglia Ruskin University and along with his doctor brother Safeel-accused of concealing information about the attack being planned- is said to have thrived on the perceived persecution of Muslims around the world.
At that time, the sudden appearance of the brothers on the terror radar did not cause in India the kind of alarm it should have nor did it give any indication of it becoming a trend any time soon. Possibly because, in the words of a top counter-terror officer, Indian security agencies have mostly been reactive and the terrorists or wannabe extremists have been steps ahead.
The dawn of 2014 and the rise of ISIS changed that for good. ISIS, it seems, held the same attraction as the al Qaeda did in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks in the US. Violence seemed the answer for young Muslim men with a grievance-historical or current political frustrations and cultural claustrophobia or a combination of all three and more.
The first expression of that goal was the desire to fly to Iraq, join ISIS and its push for a Caliphate. ""The Kalyan boys came closest to this trend,"" says Sameer Patil, an associate fellow for national security at the Mumbai think tank Gateway House and a former assistant director at the National Security Council Secretariat. ""They surfed the internet, got self-radicalised, went to Iraq and then to Mosul, and if all would have gone well, they would have joined the fighting ranks. And at some point, they could have been asked to go back and launch attacks in India.""
The other option that manifested marginally earlier in 2013 was to scout for extremist connections online and get tapped by 'talent hunters' of the IM, SIMI or LeT. While LeT has been in the spotlight and under immense pressure since the 26/11 Mumbai attack, IM and SIMI have seen their senior leaders get arrested and a depletion in the number of foot soldiers. These groups, which also work with each other, need new talent to keep the terror factory running and the ""freelance radicals"" were easy fodder. They were picked from places as diverse as Bihar, Jharkhand and Rajasthan, and some were used to execute the relatively ineffective attacks in Bodh Gaya and Patna. Others like the engineering students from Rajasthan were arrested before they could act.

Security agencies who were jolted by the Kalyan case and investigators probing the background of the men have been working to construct a narrative that explains why seemingly normal young men from ordinary backgrounds get drawn to a conflict thousands of miles away and are more than eager to court danger. And the answers are neither simple nor linear.
""We call it the threshold of radicalisation,"" says one top counter-terror officer. ""It is like asking why 'x' becomes alcoholic and 'y' does not. There is no straitjacket for terror. But one common thread is their low threshold. They are unhappy with the way things are and want to change and control the world. They think the Caliphate can do that. It is probably a personality or a psychological issue.""
The other common thread, one which all security agencies and terror experts agree about with no hesitation, is the difference technology has made. From posting messages on Facebook, Twitter, sundry blogs and chat rooms to have their fill of extremist ideology and make connections to using proxy servers, masking software and peer-to-peer networks to communicate anonymously, the new, freelance radical has a range of options to stay below the radar of security agencies and pursue his diabolical plans. So much so that security officials call technology the new weapon of terrorists.
For instance, when the Delhi Police Special Cell arrested IM operatives Waqas and Tehseen Akhtar, they were in the process of activating a sleeper cell of three engineering students in Rajasthan. Atta Bhatkal, an IM handler alleged to be in Pakistan, got in touch with them through Facebook and subsequently 'recruited' them through a more secure messenger service called Nimbuzz. After their radicalisation was thought to be complete, they were trained by Tehseen for a month. But the Delhi Police Special Cell was on their trail and nabbed them before they could cause harm.
Special Cell officers told INDIA TODAY that being engineering students, the three men were net-savvy and were concerned about global events, particularly the condition of Muslims. They even desired to fight NATO forces in Afghanistan and were so keen that every time they chatted with their handlers, they insisted on being assigned a ""task"". Their interrogation also revealed that they were planning to attack foreign tourists in Pushkar on their own and had even allegedly managed to procure raw materials for making a bomb.
Ajai Sahni, executive director of New Delhi's Institute for Conflict Management, says India has so far been lucky in that only a handful of young men have managed to get the ISIS experience compared to hundreds from Europe who are known to have spent time in Iraq or Syria and returned. And are thought to be ticking time bombs, waiting to explode. ""The lone wolf phenomenon has been around for some time but the difference now is that Islamist terrorist formations are trying to actively encourage this,"" adds Sahni. ""This will meet with greater success if people go out in large numbers, get significant training, whether it is in Pakistan or Iraq or Syria, come back to India and are not detected.""
In tune with the times
If technology is helping give shape to the extreme ambitions of radicalised youths, the terror factory too is innovating. Iqbal Bhatkal, who runs IM from Karachi, does not have a large facility like other anti-India terror groups in Pakistan. The questioning of two Pakistani terrorists-Abdul Waleed and Fahim-who were held in March last year from the India-Nepal border revealed that Bhatkal stays in touch with all his recruits through chat apps such as Nimbuzz, providing them with, at the most, a mobile phone and fake identities. His own facility is a room full of computers, each dedicated to a module or two.
While the outfit has no training facility of its own, Bhatkal managed to send the duo to camps in Baramcha, a town on the Af-Pak border. Fahim, in fact, told interrogators that he was not happy about not being given live ammunition agreed as part of the deal. He was told that he would have to pay for it. Their accounts revealed that these camps provide training to any wannabe terrorist as long as they come with the right reference.
In many ways, the logistics and infrastructure that go into making a terrorist has also innovated with demand, leading to diverse groups using common facilities, exchanging assets and, at times, just allowing individuals to execute their own plans.
Top police officers across the country as well as those with premier central agencies admit the freelance radical has made their job of fighting terror that much tougher and that there is no silver bullet to counter it. Mastering technology and keeping pace with the wannabe terrorist, launching counter-radicalisation programmes and ensuring that police investigations don't end up escalating the sense of alienation among these young men are some of the steps they say are needed urgently to curb the freelance radical phenomenon.
""We need to target their communication channels. As their network is fluid, it becomes impossible to intercept their messages. The communication is largely encrypted and it is difficult to crack the codes,"" says A.P. Anand Kumar, inspector general of police, Hyderabad Police. Adds M. Chandra Sekar, joint commissioner of police (crime), Bangalore: ""It is a big challenge for Indian security agencies to effectively monitor cyberspace where propaganda material is available easily. Efforts are being made by the government but they all are in nascent stages.""
Sultan Shahin, who runs New Age Islam, a Delhi-based website that counters jihadi propaganda, says the solution also lies within the community as it is easier to discredit interpretations of Islam that permit the murder of thousands of innocents. ""Many countries have used authoritative Muslim religious and legal figures who renounce violent jihad and counter jihadis,"" he says.
Evidently, the battle against freelance radicals and self-made terrorists has only just begun. Besides tracking and countering threats from outside the country, the new government with its muscular security policy also needs to look within and come up with a comprehensive strategy-one that involves the states and civil society- to tackle and eliminate the problem. Because, there might not always be a foreign hand to blame.

75,Goa minister Ramesh Tawadkar does a U-turn on LGBT remarks,[],2015-01-13 16:28:00,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201501/goa-650_011315035716.jpg,"Goa Sports Minister Ramesh Tawadkar Goa Sports Minister Ramesh Tawadkar
Goa minister Ramesh Tawadkar on Tuesday took a U-turn after his remarks on giving treatment for LGBT community to make them ""normal"" triggered a row.
Ramesh Tawadkar claimed he was misquoted even as Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar did some damage control to say homosexuality is not a ""disease"".
""I was misunderstood and misquoted. I was not talking about the LGBT (youths) but about drug addicted and sexually abused youths,"" Tawadkar told PTI, as local channels in Goa continued to air the footage in which he assured medical treatment to LGBT youths to make them ""normal"".
""Youth policy speaks about drug addicted youths and sexually abused youths as a focused group. There are provisions in the central government sponsored Social Justice Scheme for such youths which can be implemented in Goa,"" the Sports and Youth Affairs minister said, a day after he was widely criticised for his statements.
He said when journalists asked him about LGBTs(Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transgenders), he told them, ""I am not expert on the issue.""
The minister also refused to acknowledge LGBT as a focused group, though the youth policy document which is currently in public domain has mentioned them as one.
""We will make them normal. We will have a centre for them. Like Alcoholic Anonymous centres, we will have centres. We will train them and give them medicines too,"" the minister had said.
""Like in the case of other target groups such as juvenile offenders, drug afflicted youth, marginalised or migrant youth, geographically disadvantaged youth, a detailed survey would be carried out among state LGBT community, so that their problems could be specifically addressed,"" he had added.
In a damage control exercise, Parsekar said, ""Homosexuality is a natural thing, it is not a disease...It could be ignorance. Probably, he might have thought of some other question and reacted.""
Asked what was the state government's stand on homosexuality, he said, ""it is a natural thing"".
The row broke out even as visiting UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon strongly opposed the criminalisation of homosexuality in India, saying that doing so breeds intolerance by violating basic rights to privacy and freedom.
Reacting to Tawadkar's remarks, noted fashion designer Wendell Rodricks said the minister was trying to divert attention from the main issues by talking such things.
""There are lot of other issues which need urgent attention in Goa. They should concentrate on real issues like corruption, illegal constructions, drug mafia, lawlessness and others,"" said Wendell.
Wendell also took to Twitter to lodge his protest over and said, ""They seem #lost in the #Goa mist. Talk about quick backtrack on the #LGBT #treatment #centres in Goa.
In another tweet he wrote, ""Another#U-turn by the #morons vis a vis the #LGBT #treatment #centres in #Goa.""
The Congress party too strongly reacted to the minister's statement.
""How can minister make such regressive statement? LGBTs are normal people just like us and we cannot treat them (like this). This is a shameless statement, Congress Goa spokesman Agnelo Fernandes said."

Goa Sports and Youth Affairs Minister Ramesh Tawadkar's comment about his government's intention to set up centres to offer medicinal treatment to the LGBT youth so as to normailse them attracted flak on the social media as well in the opposition ranks in Goa.
Tawadkar on Monday said that the Goa government was contemplating to start centres on the lines of Alcoholics Anonymous in order to make the LGBT youth normal. He was speaking to the media on the sidelines of a function held to launch the Goa State Youth Policy 2015 on Monday.
Twitter comments by the lesbian, gay bisexual and transgender community with the hashtag #ClinicBharo dedicated to Tawadkar's controversial statement took several digs at the Goa minister for his comments.
Says Manak Matiyani @Dafliwala: ""So are they allocating land close to the beach for the #GoaLGBTClinics? Must take a dip with other patients #ClinicBharo with #AnonymousLGBT
@delhiqueerpride tweeted: ""Hope the GoaGovernment clinics have separate gender dorms #AdmitLGBTAnonymous #ClinicBharo.""
""We will train them and (give them) medicines too,"" he added.
The Opposition Congress has also criticised Tawadkar for what it calls making an ""unscientific, illogical and brainless"" statement.
""Everyone has a right to live their life the way they want to. This statement is similar to the statement made by Baba Ramdev in 2013, when he had also offered to 'cure' homosexuality. Is the BJP government in Goa towing the Ramdev line?"" asked Congress spokesperson Durgadas Kamat."

According to IANS reports, Tawadkar was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an event held in Panaji to launch the Goa State Youth Policy 2015 on the occasion of National Youth Day. The policy lists ""stigmatised"" LGBT youth as one of the many ""target groups"" which the documents says required ""focused attention"".
""We will make them normal. We will have a centre for them. Like Alcoholic Anonymous centres, we will have centres"" Tawadkar said.
When asked what exactly was the role of the special centres that the government was proposing to set up for Lesbians, Gay, Bi-sexual and Transgender (LGBT) youth, Tawadkar said: ""We will train them and (give them) medicines too.""
Like in the case of other ""target groups"" such as juvenile offenders, drug afflicted youth, marginalised or migrant youth, geographically disadvantaged youth, a detailed survey would be carried out among state LGBT community, so that their problems could be specifically addressed, he said."
78,Hooked to the handset,[],2014-11-24 22:23:08,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201407/mobile-jul28-1_650_071814023051.jpg,"If everyone has five vital organs, she has six: brain, heart, lungs, kidneys, liver and her mobile phone.
She walks, talks, even goes to the washroom with the gadget fixed to her mouth, ears or hands. ""I'm listening,"" she says, every time there's a lull in conversation because she's checking her phone or laughing at a text. If told she's on it too much, she fights with the fury of a tigress: ""It's from office."" Or she tries to do it covertly, under the table. Sometimes she looks for her phone frantically, only to realise it's in her hand. And sometimes she thinks her phone's buzzing, but there's really no call or text. Good God, her friends say, she's so boring.
You may not know but you are probably having an affair with your cell phone. It's what you wake up to and fall asleep with. You look at it 150 times a day on an average: to talk, text, mail, chat, browse Twitter or Facebook. And also to play games, watch movies, consume news, change songs, take pictures, go to apps, shop online, tell the time, plug or unplug. You read, send or check text messages 23 times in your 16 waking hours. You make, receive, miss, drop or avoid calls 22 times every day. And every time, the sound of your phone floods your brain with the same chemicals that are unleashed by the proximity of a loved one. But what if you start loving your object of desire a bit too much?
That's the latest buzz among doctors. In the midst of a mobile phone explosion, India is witnessing a rising tide of 'mobile phone addicts', people who have fallen so hopelessly in love with their handsets that it's taking a profound toll on their behaviour, health and life. Psychologists and practitioners of community medicine are trying to understand the mysterious relationship between a cell phone and its owner's ardour.
A raft of studies is coming out in learned journals. And India's first clinic to treat mobile phone addiction has just come up at the country's top school for mental disorders: the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) in Bangalore.
Our mobile lover might be boring, but she is not alone: She is a face among India's 900 million mobile users-the world's second-largest, after China. And one of 15 per cent Indians who spend three hours a day to view 70 per cent internet pages via mobile. If four hours is the average time Indians spend on their phones a day (compared to 2.5 hours in the US), she uses it much more, like 68 per cent users who confess to be addicted to their phones. And like 43 per cent of them, she too would try to save her plastic love first in an emergency.
Is it really akin to drug and alcohol addiction? Or is it just casual talk, an attempt to medicalise everyday behaviour?
No. Experts are dead serious about this. ""Some people find it so pleasurable to use mobile phones that they keep using it. Their behaviour harms them or others and still they can't stop, just like any other addiction,"" says clinical psychologist Dr Manoj Kumar Sharma, who leads the NIMHANS centre, SHUT (Clinic Service for Healthy Use of Technology.) ""MRI scans have shown that many compulsive behaviours light up the same pleasure centres in the brain in almost the same way as drug or alcohol dependencies."" Mobile phone addiction may soon get included in the Bible for psychiatric illnesses, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Right now it is listed in the appendix for further research.
Who gets hooked? Anyone: the thrill-seeker, the depressed, the stressed-out, the lonely, who feel the urge to be connected. ""For many, it's a tool to cope with bad moods,"" says Dr Ritu Nehra, clinical psychologist with PGIMER, Chandigarh. ""That's what 70 per cent of 200 undergraduate students we studied in 2012 said. Nearly 50 per cent felt 'incomplete' without it."" The addiction does not cause obvious physical problems but can lead to serious psychological issues, she explains: from anxiety, sleeplessness to neglecting studies or job to drifting away from close ties.
It was first in 2011 that Sharma started getting queries from parents and schools on the excessive use of mobile phones among teenagers. He wasn't surprised. With digitally nimble teens taking to mobile phones, what used to be the rush to the school canteen to tell everyone what's going on has become the rush to the handset to spill and share secrets. In a June 2014 study by Tata Consultancy Services, 71 per cent of 12,300 students across 12 cities called it their ""favourite gadget"". The mobile phone is a key tool that determines how they live, work and play. In May this year, a Class XII student of a Gurgaon school committed suicide after she was chided by her teacher for texting messages in class. In June 2013, a 16-year-old fell off a local train in Mumbai. She was too busy speaking on her mobile phone.
Most parents approach the NIMHANS clinic either because academic grades have started to drop or sudden behaviour changes have been detected. Typically, what begins as an hour-long daily activity-internet, gaming, social media-spirals into an obsession that consumes six to seven hours a day or more. The child tries not to go to school, avoids friends, family outings, food and sleep. Anger, aggression, irritability are seen when they are forced to part with their phones. When they start avoiding conversation and eye contact, parents come running: ""I am losing my child."" ""Children like the freedom, anonymity and innovative thrills of the virtual world,"" Sharma says. ""But the line between reality and its simulations can blur dangerously.""
Scientists are busy classifying the range of phone addiction they observe: from nomophobia, the fear of having no mobile phones, to textaphrenia, or thinking that a message has arrived when it hasn't, to textiety, or panic attacks over not receiving or sending text messages.
When Dr Sanjay Dixit, professor and head of community medicine at the MGM Medical College in Indore, conducted a study on 200 MBBS students in 2009, he found that nine out of 10 showed some form of phone addiction: 56 per cent kept mobile phones close to their body to be in constant touch with it, 93 per cent got panic attacks when they did not get messages, 42 per cent suffered from disturbed sleep due to excessive phone use, and 19 per cent had painful thumbs due to over-texting. ""It's truly a new evolutionary twist to the gadget Alexander Graham Bell had engineered,"" he says. ""The addiction comes from your fear that something enormously important will happen while you are out of reach and that you won't be able to react,"" says Dixit. Needless to say, it's an exaggerated fear.
In the privacy of the mobile phone, all kinds of behavioural addictions thrive. Sample a 35-year-old Bangalore mother's case. Two years ago, she quit her job to stay at home with her fouryear-old son, as her husband had a transferable job. She felt crushed by loneliness and boredom. But she did find an emotional outlet-the games on her smartphone. She couldn't seem to stay away. Soon, she was telling herself she would do it for an hour or two at the end of the day, but she would wind up gaming all night. ""When you're in that state, you're not thinking clearly,"" she says. It took her son-as he started picking up her habits-to sound the alarm. ""If he gets hooked on to the phone at this age, I don't know how I'll live with myself,"" she remembers thinking. She called Sharma and went through intensive therapy. She hasn't checked agaming site since.
Her story nods to the fact that therapy can be effective. That's a relief at a time mobile phones, with everexpanding frills and features, burrow deeper into our lives and the sceptre of addiction stalks a talkative nation. With therapy catching up with science, doctors aredetailing lists of things that can be done to combat the technology disorder.
One often-suggested solution is to step away from the phone for a while and connect with nature. The other is to make sure you get a full night's sleep, apart from forbidding technology at the dinner table. The bottom line is: bring in a sense of balance and be aware. Mobile phone addiction is not fatal and by using a few simple strategies to resettle your brain you can live happily ever after even with your mobile phone."
79,Uncovered: Cancer belt near Delhi,[],2014-10-27 19:20:43,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"Move over Punjab's notorious Malwa, for there's a new belt in north India that's ruled by the Big C. And it's less than an hour's drive from the heart of the Capital. At least five villages around the Chhapraula Industrial Area in Greater Noida (Uttar Pradesh), have seen an abnormally high number of cancer cases surface in the last five years. These villages are: Sadopur, Achheja, Sadullapur, Bishnuli, and Khera Dharampura, a rural swathe about 30 km from Delhi.
Most of the cancers in these afflicted villages are related to the organs in the gut, including the liver. Blood cancer is also fairly common. An extraordinarily high number of cases of hepatitis, liver ailments, stomach problems and skin diseases in the context of a preponderance of gut-related cancers point to carcinogens in water.
Villagers from this belt (see accompanying map) said that the groundwater in the area used to be 'sweet' and of good quality till about 20 years ago, when the Chhapraula Industrial Area was set up.
After that, they said, the water has deteriorated alarmingly in quality. The industrial area houses over 100 factories engaged in manufacturing adhesives, cosmetics, pesticides, TV tubes and also the parboiling and dehusking of large quantities of rice. Some local residents who work in the units of the park said that there are no nullahs or drains that carry industrial effluents away. 'It's all being dumped into the ground through wells,' said one on condition of anonymity.
Cases mount
The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), which has already collected and tested samples of groundwater from this area, has declared it has found no anomaly in the water. Tests by private entities conducted on behalf of the villagers have also proved to be inconclusive.
Meanwhile, cases of cancer continue to mount here claiming the lives of young and old men, women and children.
Nagendar Singh, the pradhan of Sadopur which has the most cancer cases, said, 'The Greater Noida Authority has done us great harm by shifting the most polluting factories of Delhi to our region. I remember that till even a few years, the groundwater of our area used to be the best in Uttar Pradesh. After these factories came up, our water has turned orange. We have had to install electrical water filters (ROs) in every house and yet new cancer cases are coming up every month.'
The enormity of the situation is most tellingly told by the numbers in Sadopur. Shripal Sharma, a 50-year-old shopkeeper, is suffering from chest tumour. Five years ago, his elder brother Brahmapal Sharma died of throat cancer.
Last year, his son Amit Sharma died of Hepatitis C which is linked by doctors to cancer of the liver. Not just this, two brothers - Bhopal Singh and Shubhlesh Singh - who live next to Sharma are also suffering from cancer while their nephew Reetu also has Hepatitis C.
Villagers in adjoining Bishnuli village are eager to tell the story of Yogesh Rausa, 23, who died of blood cancer in September. His family members emphasise that he had no bad habit of chewing paan or tobacco, smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol. Neither was there any case of cancer in Rausa's family before this. His uncle Ravinder Singh said, 'He has left behind a wife and a three-year-old child.
You can imagine how we spent our Diwali and Bhai Dooj. There was not one person who did not have tears in his eyes.'
Not very far away, Bisraj Bhati, a 60-year-old, is undergoing treatment for cancer at Max Hospital. Ravinder Singh said, ""At least 10 per cent of the village is suffering from cancer. One arthi is lifted every month.' In Khera Dharampura, Harender Bhati is in despair: his two-year old son is suffering from cancer. Said Bhati: 'I spend most of my days at AIIMS. I have a private job but I don't know how I will carry on at this rate.'
Neeraj Sharma, an advocate from Khera Dharampura, said, 'There is a block here which has now come to be known as 'cancerwala mohalla'. Every other person is suffering there.'
Cautious
The villagers want to be helped, but are cautious about publicity. Said one gram pradhan: 'We do have a large number of cancer cases here but it's better not publicised. We don't want a situation where people of other villages don't want to get their daughters married to our boys.'
The Chief Medical Officer of Gautam Buddh Nagar District, Dr R.K. Garg, pleaded ignorance on the issue. A senior official of the UPPCB acknowledged the problem as part of his denial: 'We have already tested underground water in the area once and have found nothing. We are ourselves trying to understand what the reason for this phenomenon could be-whether it is related to genetics, water pollution or air pollution. We have already written to the CMO of the area to conduct a detailed study.'
The villagers have, however, lost faith in the government and its organs. Local activist Yogesh Nagar said, 'We have little faith in the authorities or UPPCB. We saw how they took samples last time; they were neither sealed nor signed on. Something must be done soon to arrest this situation.'
The five stricken villages of Greater Noida couldn't agree more."

Calling himself a medium who introduced the audiences to real heroes, he said that the show changed his perspective towards life.
""I think I have become a bit brittle. That happens when you see that all is not well with the world,"" said the actor.
Talking about the show, he said it took a lot of time to convert the idea into reality.
""The idea had been brewing in my mind for a long time. I was offered a game show by Star television, which I refused. When I suggested Satyamev Jayate, the television network agreed. We started out with a very small team, and were convinced that we would do the project only if our research was impeccable.""
Aamir said that the show changed his perspective towards life. Aamir said that the show changed his perspective towards life.
Admitting that he never anticipated such an overwhelming response to the show, Khan aid that the aim of the latest episode which focused on sports was to exhort children to dump their video games and go out in the open. ""It is so disturbing that they have forgotten how to play under harsh elements. Outdoor sports are also about socialising and realising the importance of team play. Besides, look at the violence in digital games. It's so sad to see the younger generation getting addicted to them. Schools are also to be blamed. Tell me, which school treats sports as an integral part of mainstream education?"" he asked.
Stressing that being part of the show is his ""contribution"" towards making the society aware of the ills plaguing it, Khan is clear, ""I don't have any false assumptions that I can change the country or the society. But yes, I can tell a story, make people aware, make them see what they refuse to. No single individual can be the harbinger of instrumental change. It is always a collective process. But always remember, when you give people information, you give them a peculiar power that can go a long way in making things change for the better.""
Smiling that entering politics is the last thing on his mind, Khan, who offered to be the brand ambassador of the Clean India campaign and ascertains zero waste in his office tells that ""happiness"" keeps him motivated. ""I do only those projects which promise to excite me no end. That's precisely the reason that I give 100 per cent to whatever I do. Happiness is not about a fat cheque but a constant kick that keeps you going,"" he said.
Refusing to elaborate on the themes of upcoming shows of Satyamev Jayate, the actor is happy that his show has forced the state machinery to take major steps. ""Look at the Child Protection Bill, which has been passed by the Parliament. Do you know that 40 lakh children called the child helpline number after our show on child abuse was aired. Four lakh people got in touch with Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) after our show. The Collector of Gwalior has taken many steps to ensure that most public areas in that city are accessible to the specially-abled,"" he concluded."

It is the voice that no Indian can miss. Delightfully high, the notes rendered clearly to the last bar, the words pronounced with a rare panache the voice has haunted Indians for over three decades. It has chased them wherever they have gone at film shows, restaurants, hairdressers, carnivals, beach parties, Durga Puja pandals. It has greeted them on the radio and television, record-player and tape-recorder.The voice, like the blithe spirit of music, has wafted far and wide. It is the voice to which the roadside vendor in Delhi has transacted his business, the long-distance trucker has sped along the highway, the Army jawan in Ladakh has kept guard at his frontier bunker, or the glittering elite of Bombay have dined in luxury hotels.The voice, like Mahatma Gandhi's loin cloth and Rabindranath Tagore's beard, has become a part of India's collective unconscious. If Marshall McLuhan, the communication wizard, were still alive and called upon to cast an eye across his ""global village"" -to India's music scene, he might have paid homage to the voice with the new phrase: ""music is the massage"".The ""masseur"" of this all-pervading music, and the queen-empress of India's immensely popular light music industry, is a portly, dark, camera shy, plain-as-Jane Marathi woman.Latabai Mangeshkar, who, as a playback singer, enjoys today a clout which even the movie moguls of the country's Rs 100-crore film industry cannot dream of. One imperious frown from her sends the country's highest paid music directors in a panic.A single disapproving shake of her head makes the top brass of internationally connected record companies grow cold feet. As Shanker of the famed Shanker-Jaikishen music director duo put it: ""Lataji catches cold, and the whole industry sneezes.""No woman in the world has cut as many discs as Lata, at 51, has. It is doubtful if any man has matched her output, though the publishers of Guinness Book of Records, caught in a maelstrom of controversy a few years ago, have dropped from their latest issue the earlier claim that she indeed held the world record.: She might not have recorded all the 26,000 songs that Guinness had earlier said. But industry sources aver that she had sung 300 songs on an average in each of the first five years of her career.500 songs annually during the next 23 years. Since 1974, though foreign tours have been interfering with her singing in India, she has still managed 150 songs in a year. That adds up to 14,050 songs, not to speak of at least 500 songs in her private records. This fact, in itself, should imply that she has out sung her closest rival, the late Mohammed Rafi. In the process, she has reportedly earned fabulous riches, only a rough estimate of which is possible.The tinsel world of show business advertises everything but is tight-lipped about the actual amounts that change hands. Lata does not discuss her finances, not with newsmen at least. But the industry has its own system of keeping tabs on individual earnings. Such unconfirmed guesstimates suggest that she charged Rs 300 for a song on an average during her first five years of film-singing: Rs 2,000 for the next 10 years; Rs 5,000 for the next 13 years; and anything around Rs 25,000 as of now. The same pundits aver that no singer today gets as much as Rs 15,000 for a song and many of them frequently settle for much less than their professed rates. Lata never does that, they say.However, Lata's earning from films does not include the huge royalty which is roughly one rupee on each of her LPs sold. Her annual royalty is estimated at Rs 1.5 lakhs, from the Calcutta-based Gramophone Company of India (GO) and about Rs 50, 000 from Polydor. Add to that the many times higher earning from gate sales of tickets for her performances in India and abroad, and there is a staggering inflow of cash, spread over many years.Says a film financier: '""Lataji's earning power must amount to about Rs 350-400 per hour."" Lata herself refuses to comment but denies the validity of the calculations such as these. Said an industry source: ""What she does with the money she earns is the greatest mystery yet."" Nobody seems to know and the people in her immediate circle are very tight-lipped. However, she owns a film studio in Kolhapur called Jai Prabha studio.She seems to have an emotional attachment with Kolhapur, because she has kept the studio even though it hardly breaks even. And he adds as an afterthought: ""She's got chewing gum on her hands, no money ever leaves once she's got it.Unlike the other money-earning machines in Bombay's film industry, Lata has remained at the top for over three-and-a-half decades. In the process, it is she who has set the exchange rate between music and money in this country And. like a living juke box, she has sung on without fatigue, for a price of course.

: In artistic terms, she has done much more. She has elevated playback singing from its surrogate status to that of a highly valued component of the country's burgeoning entertainment industry, as far back as 1959. Time described her as the ""indisputable and indispensable queen of India's playback singers"".The reservoir of accomplishment that Lata is today is the consummate end-product of years of sweating and grinding in a very limited sphere of vocal music. The playback singer is only required to identify himself with the person on the screen within a bare span of three-and-a-half minutes. It may be a restricted art; but. like a carving of ivory two inches high, it calls for a highly effective condensation.Lata Mangeshkar does it with a breathtaking ease. In most cases, she sings without a proper rehearsal and sings straight into the film's sound track, without any re-take and with the accompaniment of a 70-man orchestra.In 1977. she flew straight back from a long foreign tour to record for Raj Kapoor's Satyam Shivam Sundaram. Listened for 10 minutes to the music directors Laxmikant-Pyarelal humming out the tentative outlines of the theme song, and walked into the recording studio. The result was a song that topped the charts for nearly two years.She sang in Hindi films as early as 1946. Last fortnight, she had contracts to sing for at least 50 films in Bombay. She sang for the glamour queens of the past, like Madhubala and Nargis.She sings with equal ease now for girls born yesterday. There is a joke in the filmland which says: ""Pay up double her price to Lata, and she'll sing both for the heroine and the hero."": Like all successful artistes, she too has her bitter critics who would argue that she had lost her golden voice. ""The Lata Mangeshkar of today is a pale ghost of what she was in the past,""said C. Ramchandra, the music director who created the fabled score of Anarkali and was once an intimate friend. But chances are, as a young music director snapped back, men like Ramchandra are themselves ""a pale ghost"" of their past.As though to prove him right, the disc of her live performance at London's Palladium Theatre, cut in December last, sold out its first 25,000 impressions in a matter of five weeks despite its high price tag of Rs 100.There is no sign of decline in her recent best-selling songs of Sargam, for which the record company issued a gold disc. The disc she has cut for the recent film, dosha, is as meticulously honed to perfection as some of her earlier top-sellers. As late as 1979, EMI, the US-based principals of the GCI, chose her as the first Asian artiste to receive their platinum disc.She is now cutting back on her film singing, but has hit upon an ingenious device to re-cycle her old film hits: re-recording them at live concerts. This is entirely to her advantage since the 10 per cent or so royalty on these songs goes straight to her. bypassing such intermediaries as producers of films where the songs featured.She is also getting more and more exposure abroad. It started with her performance at London's prestigious Royal Albert Hall in 1974 in aid of the Nehru Memorial Fund. She cut a disc from it set in two LPs which sold more than 133,000 copies.Presently she performs all over the USA, Canada and Europe, where she draws unbelievably large ethnic audiences. Last November, all the 8, 500 seats at Felt Forum auditorium in Madison Square Garden, New York, were full with cheering, clapping Indo-Pakistanis even though tickets sold for $30 (Rs 240) apiece. Amitabh Bachchan, flown in specially for the occasion, regaled the audience with a brief appearance. A 20-man orchestra accompanied her on the tour, at her cost. The expenses were met from the $180,000 (Rs 14.4 lakh) she grossed in her dozen performances in America.: A measure of her saleability abroad may be found from the fees charged by her and Ravi Shankar for a single performance in the USA and Canada. While she demands, and gets. $ 15,000 (Rs 1.2 lakh). Shankar charges a paltry $1,000 (Rs 8,000). But, unlike Shankar, she hardly commands an international audience. Says Veena Ahuja, 30, a Lata fan in New York: ""She's a rage among the Indians in America and a passing curiosity among the Americans.""The music industry is all set to exploit her popularity overseas by selling the ""voice"" to the petro-dollar market. The plan is to set her most popular film tunes to Arabic translation of the words, and to get Lata to sing them out.""It shouldn't be difficult,"" says Anil Sud, who heads the GCL ""given Lata's talents as a perfectionist."" He is probably right on that point, because in all the 14 Indian languages (other than Hindi) in which she has sung, her pronunciations have been surprisingly close to the natural. Her 1979 album of Bengali songs cut during the Durga Puja, sold out 13, 000 copies in three months.If there is any musical range in which she has faltered it is in ghazals and devotional singing. In ghazals, the Jagjit-Chitra team has put everyone else in the shade, Begum Akhtar and even Pakistan's Mehdi Hasan, not to speak of Lata.The first Jagjit-Chitra LP, cut by the GCL in 1976 and named The Unforgetables has sold nearly 52,000 discs till now and is still selling 500 discs a month. Their Come Alive a two-LP album, cut in 1978, has sold 60,000 copies. Compared to Jagjit-Chitra, Mehdi Hasan, the famous Pakistani ghazal singer, was only a moderate success in India, his lone LP selling some 18.000 copies. And Lata's sole ghazal venture, Lata Mcmgeshkar sings Ghalib cut as far back as 1969, has sold only 12,892 copies.Again, if Lata had never quite been able to make it to the top in ghazals, she lost her lead in devotional songs recently to Hari Om Sharan, a musical phenomenon of the late '70s whose bhajans, sung in a mellow velvety voice, leapt to the top of the charts. His first LP Pushpanjali, cut in 1975, has sold 65,360 copies, and is still a hot seller, Premanjali the next LP released in 1978, has sold 25,371 copies and is likely to level up with Pushpanjali in a couple of years.Lata's own repertory of devotional songs is extensive. But the sales do not come anywhere near Sharan's. Her 1971 LP of Meera bhajans, for example, sold 28,959 copies while her 1976 album of bhajans, Chala Wahi Des, sold 18,967.Abhang Tukyaehi, her album of Marathi devotional songs, marketed largely in western India, sold only 14,528. In 1970, the ingenious marketing cell of GSI evolved its own packaging of devotion and music when it got Lata to recite the Bhagvadgita in Sanskrit. The result was a steady-selling album. However, Lata still won a pyrrhic victory over Sharan, Jagjit-Chitra and the rest of the non-film singers by showing the highly popular albums of her live performances abroad as basic records.Apart from the record sale of the Royal Albert Hall discs, the indications available in the industry make it abundantly clear that her 1980 live recording of the Palladium Theatre performance will sweep into the six-figure mark shortly.Lata Mangeshkar's early life is a Dickensian saga of nightmarish poverty, drudgery and hard luck. She was born in Indore, away from the Maratha heartland of Maharashtra. Her father, Dinanath Mangeshkar, who came from Mangeshi in Goa, was a classical singer trained in the colourful Punjabi school of Baba Mushelkar. Dinanath owned an itinerant dramatic troupe which made him pitch his tent in nearly every town that dots the state-among them Pune, Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli, and Miraj.The children-four daughters and a son-were roped into a nomadic life by their father's profession. Unable to arrange a proper schooling for his children, Dinanath however sought to compensate by injecting stiff doses of music lessons early in life. ""The foundation of my musical propensities was laid as early as that,"" Lata said.: It was a carefree life where music held the key. The children hopped in and out of stage whenever the story needed child artistes, and they sang whenever they were home.The stuff that they practised on was rather heavy. To make up for it, they sat by the wings as curtains rose on those endlessly long mythological plays which were music, music all the way.Dinanath's drama company, Balwant Sangeet Natak Mandal, though not a hot money spinner, allowed the family a modestly comfortable life. The only childhood calamity for Lata, the eldest of the children, was an attack of smallpox at the age of two. She still carries its marks.The real disaster for the family came in 1934-35 after Ardeshir Irani, an interpid Parsee, pushed the Indian cinema out of the silent era with the first ""talkie"",The multitude of roving drama companies of Maharashtra, the only other state to have them except Bengal, reeled under the impact of this ""sound invasion"". Most of them, including Dinanath's Balwant Mandal, closed down. The family moved to Sangli, a small trading town, where, as Lata says, ""We settled down for the first time.""At Sangli, Dinanath, who had all the tiery determination that marks the Mangeshkar clan, pawned his wife's ornaments to start a film company. The switchover was not easy.Audience sensibility in the '30s was rapidly changing, so his canned theatre could not find many buyers. Dinanath's four mythological plays in Marathi and his lone Hindi film, Andheri Duniya, were flops in a row.As creditors closed in on him, the only escape route available was in alcohol. In 1938, the film company wound up and the family moved out again, this time to Pune.: For the remaining four years of Dinanath's life, the family survived on his meagre income from singing at the Pune station of All India Radio. In 1942, when Dinanath died of pleurisy, heart disease and frustration, Hridaynath, the youngest child, who is a music director now, was lying in bed next to his father with tuberculosis of the bones.On the eighth day of Dinanath's death, Lata, only 13 at that time, put on full war paint to act and sing in Pahili Manglagaw, a Marathi film by Master Vinayak Rao, father of Nanda, the well-known actress.In Pahili, Lata played the heroine's sister and had three songs. ""I hated putting on make-up; I hated standing in the glare of lights. But I was the breadwinner of the family, and there was hardly any choice left. The day I went to work in Master Vinayak's film, there was nothing to eat in the house."" Her struggle had in fact begun a month earlier when Sadasivrao Nevrekar, a friend of the family, had offered her the maiden chance for playback singing in a film called Kitti Nasal. ""My first playback song was chopped off at the editor's table,"" she reminisces with a smile.
Vinayak was happy with her performance in Pahili, and signed her as a staff artiste on a monthly salary of Rs 60. It became Rs 350 by the time Vinayak died in 1947 and his Prafull Pictures closed down. But, in 1945, the company had already shifted its headquarters to Bombay, and Lata had moved out into the big city of her dreams. She took a house at Nana Chowk, not very far from her present apartment house- valued at Rs 20 lakh on fashionable Peddar Road. The two-room flat at Nana Chowk cost her Rs 25 a month, which was still not easy to fork out with eight mouths to feed, including cousins.
Asha Bhonsle, the younger sister who is a celebrity singer now, was too young to earn by singing. ""Didi was burning the candle at both ends to keep the family going,"" Hridaynath remembers with obvious gratitude.
The first big event for Lata in Bombay was her introduction to Aman Ali Khan Bhindi bazarwala, a classical singer who accepted her as a disciple. It was a ceremonial acceptance complete win the ritual tying of a cord around her arm. But Aman Ali left for Pakistan in the wake of Partition, and Lata had to find a new guru in Amanat Ali, an accomplished singer who taught in the same school as Amir Khan, the celebrated classical singer.Amanat Ali's death in 1951 abruptly ended Lata's apprenticeship in classical music. ""Maybe I'd have become a classical singer if Amanat Ali were alive,"" she says wistfully.But there was only an outside chance of mat, because by 1947 Lata was already established as a playback singer. The same year, she sang for a film called Majboor. It was her debut as a singer for the heroine, Majboor was a big hit. Her break in Majboor came in a dramatic manner. Soon after Vinayak's death, and the closure of Prafull Pictures, the Mangeshkar family was again down and out as Lata had no fixed income.
She approached a supplier of film extras who took her to Master Ghulam Haidar, a close friend of Amanat Ali and a leading music director of the times. Haidar, who was struck by the range and sweetness of the young girl's voice, took her to Subodh Mukherjee whose Filmistan Studio was the Mecca of Bombay's show business. Mukherjee rejected her out of hand, saying that the ""poor little thing"" had a ""squeaky"" voice which would not match with that of the heroine, Kamini Kaushal, the screen siren of the '40s.
Haidar calmly told him: ""Mukerjee, let me foretell today that this kid will very soon put to shade everyone else, including Noorjehan."" Noorjehan, who subsequently migrated to Pakistan and is still at the top there, was the biggest name in light music those days.
Lata Mangeshkar receiving the Padma Bhushan award from the President of India Lata Mangeshkar receiving the Padma Bhushan award from the President of India : The same day, Lata accompanied Haidar to the studios of Bombay Talkies at Malad. It was raining torrentially. At the platform of Goregaon station, Haidar asked Lata to sing the same song that she had just sung for Mukherjee - bulbulo mat roa tha. She sang, and Haidar kept time by tapping a tin of 555 cigarettes. The trains whistled in and out. The combined noise of commuters and vendors filled the platform. The rain pattered on the tin shed. But Haidar was immersed in the song. He did not say a word after the song ended.
An hour later, Lata was singing the same song at Bombay Talkies where she was selected to sing for Majboor. ""I never looked back since then,"" she says, flushing with pride. The recording for Majboor was not easy; it was recorded at the 32nd take. A whole battery of music directors was present at the rehearsal room of Bombay Talkies to listen to Haidar's ""discovery"". Prominent among them were Husseinlal Bhagatram, Anil Biswas, Naushad and Khemchand Prakash.
The first to come forward with another offer was Naushad, the suave Lucknow-born music director whose melodies were largely responsible for the success of the musical films in the '50s. He signed Lata for Andaaz, a smashing box-office success. Bhagatram got her to sing for Badi Batten, yet another success. Then came Barsaat where she sang jiya bekaraar hai - a song whose popularity is undiminished even today. Says Shanker who, with the late Jaikishen, created the music: ""The barsaat (rain) that had started in 1948 keeps pouring even today.""
Fame came quite suddenly to Lata, but big money still eluded her. She was paid just Rs 200 for jiya bekaraar hai and never got more than Rs 400 for a song for many years. For each song she had to sit at the rehearsals for at least a fortnight not to speak of the agony of going through at least half-a-dozen retakes.
""It was a hard life,"" she says, ""going from studio to studio."" Her day began at nine in the morning when she would board the train at Grant Road station, heading towards Dadar, Goregaon, Andheri or Malad, where the big studios were located. She would hop around the studios to catch up with the shifts. Eating at the canteens was a luxury So was a taxi ride.
: She would often go off to sleep while returning home late at night. She was frequently overcarried to Churchgate, the terminus, and, way past midnight, the sweeper women nudge her, asking her to get off. ""I walked back home from Churchgate even at that hour. Bombay was a civilised place those days,"" she says.
One day, Naushad introduced her to Dilip Kumar, the actor, in a third-class compartment of the local train (""we were all commuters those days""). Dilip Kumar was amused by her Marathified Hindi, and teased her till ""my ears tingled in shame"". Over three decades later, Dilip Kumar himself recalls the incident and says his own ears tingle in shame when he hears Lata pronouncing each Hindi and Urdu word with a rare eclat. Even in her conversation, she pronounces the words in Hindi with an uncanny precision, which is the result of years of practice.
""The story of Lata Mangeshkar,"" says film director Basu Bhattacharya, ""reads like a powerful feminist script."" It has indeed all the ingredients of a feminist plot, the single woman's search for identity in a male-dominated society, her eventual triumph and the dramatic turn of fortune.
A very important music director of the past, who is now a resident of Delhi, analysed the scenario objectively. He said: ""Some of us treated Lata like our exclusive property. We sought to dominate her, overshadow her, browbeat her. Maybe we were upset as she began paying us back in our own coin."" Some of them were obviously more than just ""upset"". Ramchandra, who was Lata's ""close friend"" for a decade, calls her ""a despotic, ruthless and vain woman; a jealous woman who cannot tolerate a single other singer; a business woman rather than an artiste.""
: Most of her critics are too awestruck by her personality to stick their necks out the way Ramchandra does. They shoot their darts from the safe fortress of anonymity. But the main charge against her is that she is wary of competition and pulls no punches to see that her rivals are squeezed out of the industry. ""No one can stop a coming force,"" she once said in an interview with Bombay TV. But her detractors see her invisible hand in at least half-a-dozen failure stories of recent years - Vani Jairam, Runa Laila, Sulakshana Pandit, Priti Sagar and Hemlata.
Except Jairam, who went back to her native Tamil Nadu where she is the topmost singer in Tamil films now, none of Lata's ""victims"" is brave enough to accuse her in public. But ""off-record"" conversations point to a modus operandi. One of them said: ""She is deceitful and has the low cunning of a bania. Often she gives boost to a singer by recommending her to music directors, and makes it known immediately so that nobody can accuse her of being intolerant later on.
Thereafter, she begins to pull the strings. At first, the 'offending' music directors find their dates with Lata cancelled. Then her 'close sources' pass on the message that peace with her could be bought only at a price, that they'd have to 'eject' the new singer."" Such deals are hard to prove. But, some years ago, Jairam, who had attained instant musical fame with the song bole re papihara in Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Guddi, suddenly found the ground slipping from under her feet.
In fact, she had compounded her 'sin' by singing in Gulzar's Meera (music: Ravi Shankar) even after Lata had at first reportedly tried to push Hridaynath as its music director and, failing which, walked out on the contract to sing for it. The demand for Jairam tapered off with unbelievable speed, and she packed off to Madras, literally unsung. Later on, Jairam charged Lata with having ""blackmailed"" the music directors into elbowing her out.
Jairam is not the only one to have gone through such an ordeal. A few years ago. Runa Laila, the stunningly beautiful singer from Bangladesh, was forced to bid goodbye to Bombay. Her private record, dama-dam masta kalandar, was a runaway success; so were her songs in Gharaonda whose music director, Jaidev, was the only person in the establishment to accept her. But others treated her as though she was untouchable. Before long, a rumour swept Bombay that she was a spy, and signing her for a song came to be regarded as almost unpatriotic. She too had to beat a hasty retreat. To Kenya, in her case.
: Lata brushes aside the charge that she was indeed responsible for the high infant mortality rate among women's singing talents. ""I was present at Runa's first public performance in Bombay; I was present even at her first recording,"" she says. ""That's exactly her alibi,"" say her critics.Undoubtedly, she has enough clout in the industry to gag any other singer if she chooses to do so. And why singers? Some years ago, she sent even Raj Kapoor on a madcap polka by playing hard-to-get for. She sang inafter a long hassle, and only after Kapoor yielded to give her a share of the royalty from records.
The only major director who has not acceded to Lata's demand for royalty-sharing is B.R. Chopra. Says a close aide of Chopra: ""We don't mean any disrespect to her. But we don't agree on business terms."" Nevertheless Chopra refuses to talk about her, even off the record. ""The fact that I don't use her means nothing, it is not because of any prejudice or anything. It is just that she ties a raakhi to me and because of the relationship with Asha I use her most of the time. But occasionally I use Lata too, it's a fantastic experience working with her,"" he averred. ""I don't even know her price, she takes whatever I pay her, she's never asked me for money. I know for a fact that when a producer does not have any money she will sing for him without charging any money. This is true of both the sisters.""
In private, however, music and film directors complain about her ""whims"". As one of them says: ""If she's not in a mood, her chauffeur would ring up the studio to say that 'madam' won't come. Not even a 'sorry'. Other leading film-makers talk in hushed tones of how her ego ""needs constant massage.""
The other music directors, while referring to her, compete with each other in toadyism. Says Laxmikant of the famous Laxmikant-Pyarelal duo: ""We've worked with Lataji for 25 years. It's impossible to describe the pleasure of working with her. In my view, there is no singer in the world who is as talented... etc."" Says Kalyanji, the betel-leaf chewing, balding harmonium player who teams up with Anandji to create such superhit scores as those of Qurbani and Muqaddar Ka Sikandar: ""Lataji accounts for 90 paise of India's film music, we make 10 paise.""
The praise, like most things in the Bombay film industry, is purely utilitarian Ramchandra fulminates in counterpoint: ""Music directors know only the third note of the octave - ga - and the sixth - dha. And that defines them - gadha (ass) They're grateful to Lata because she can lead them by their nose.""
The truth of Ramchandra""s bitter observation becomes apparent as one watches Lata working at the studio. She is like a clockwork, never taking more than one shift to learn, rehearse and record a song. Even a singer of Kishore Kumar's reputation often takes 10 rehearsals and a number of retakes for each recording. Rafi too could not wrap up a song at short notice. And, on a 70-man orchestra, saving a single shift means an economy of Rs 2,500, not to speak of the studio rent.
What makes this incredible singing machine tick? Answer: flexibility of her style, the range and quality of her voice. Sweetness of a voice may be indefinable, but its steadiness can be seen on a VU-meter, which measures pitch. Says a sound recordist at Film Centre recording studio: ""When Lata glides down to say the note A, the arm of the VU-meter stands rock-steady at 440 cycles. Eve never seen this happen with any other singer."" Her voice also has a mind-boggling range. It touches F sharp in the higher octave and descends as low as A in the lower.
Rahul Dev Burman, the doyen of the pop-style in Hindi film music, maker of the score of Shaky, and Asha's husband, says: ""In the past, it was a common practice with women singers to sing with a lot of vibrato. Only a few of them, maybe Shamshad Begum alone, avoided it. But everyone else allowed the notes to vibrate. But the style changed, and long notes became popular. Lata at once switched over to a mardana style without vibrato, without frills.""
Asha also has a breathtaking flexibility of voice. But she lacks Lata's range. Her other problem is an oozing sensuality of her voice, a compelling come-hitherness, which makes her slotted only for the cabaret and disco numbers.
Crusade: However, in the Bombay film industry, music forms an integral part of a packaging scheme. As late as 1975, the film posters used to carry the music director's name in types as bold as those of the director. But the playback singers' bargaining power was not quite decisive until Lata led a one-woman crusade in the '60s. She bargained with the producers to jack up the remuneration to a five-figure amount for every song.
Later on, she mounted collective pressure on producers to gain for the singers a part of the colossal royalty from record companies. ""It was a major victory for the singers,"" admits Vijay Kishore Dubey, chief of the key Bombay unit of the GSI. However, the money she has earned and the authority she has wielded pale into insignificance when compared to the tremendous popularity she has commanded among Indians here and abroad.
At the live show at Royal Albert Hall in 1974: Going places At the live show at Royal Albert Hall in 1974: Going places
Jawaharlal Nehru wept in public when he heard her singing. Though the nation conferred on her a mere Padma Bhushan, thousands have flocked to listen to her wherever she has sung.She has recorded in 15 Indian languages. She has been accepted in the ""deep South"" where she was given the title of Asthana Sangeetha Vidwansulu (Court Musician of the Shrine) at Tirupati. She sang a song in Nepali for which King Mahendra wrote the words. Her songs in Assamese touched as deep a chord as her Bhojpuri songs or the songs in her native Marathi.The burden of fame is a heavy cross, though she has borne it with remarkable ease. It has imperceptibly thrown a sort of cordon sanitaire around her, like the cloud of Madame Rochas perfume in which she is always entombed.Sitting primly in it like a dowager queen, she lives up to the public image of a modern Meera - the single woman in a white sari who visits the Mahalaxmi Temple every week in a white Ambassador car, a white vanity bag dangling from her hand.: Only on rare occasions does she play down the image, such as during her foreign tours. Nowadays, she stays away from the country for at least four months in a year, without counting her innumerable ""week-end trips"" to the USA and Europe. There, she does let herself go. Says Shanta Anand, a Delhi housewife married in Chicago: ""I've seen her losing heavily at casinos in Las Vegas; I've seen her enjoying her food at Bombay restaurant in New York; I've watched her driving down 52nd Street in a gay, printed sari. These are so unlike her, but I like the way she sheds her inhibitions in America.""
Lata seldom talks about that, because it does not fit into her Meera image. With all the power at her command, she keeps the nosy-parker Bombay film press at bay. She is so sensitive about her personal image that she does not even allow photographs to be taken of the yoga exercises she performs everyday for breath control. Thanks to her yoga lessons, she can carry on indefinitely without pausing for breath. But she will never admit it publicly. Nor will she accept the fact that she receives classical music lessons for one-and-a-half hours everyday from a man called Tulsidas Sharma at her house. ""The people may misunderstand if you say that Lata Mangeshkar has to take lessons from anyone,"" argues a friend of Lata's.
She is essentially a secretive person, a lone ranger in a gregarious world of glamour. Her only enduring companion is a handsome Rajasthan princeling and cricket commentator, Raj Singh Dungarpur, 45, who fixes dates for her, finalises her deals with producers, and even accompanies her on foreign tours. Both of them get uptight if their companionship gets discussed in the press. And it is only a sign of Lata's unassailable stature that the relationship is never exploited by Bombay's professional muck-rakers. The ""rumour"" chases them only at filmi cocktail parties and dies out as night advances and voices slur.
However, there is nothing to disturb her Meera image, which she cherishes. Nor does the other accusation that she has been trying to monopolise the market. But these really do not matter to her as long as she remains the ""indisputable and indispensable"" queen of Indian film music.
Lata at prayer: Maintaining the 'Meera' image Lata at prayer: Maintaining the 'Meera' image
But the music itself may undergo a change some day, as it threatened to do in '70s with the advent of ""action-packed"" movies. The average number of songs in Bombay films has already come down to four from a dozen in the '60s. Melody is giving way to electronic noise; geel is yielding place to beat.Such are the grim forebodings for India's one-woman music industry. But, till doomsday comes, Lata Mangeshkar will reign supreme-towering above criticism, and curiosity."

Smokeless tobacco - stop smoking programs; Stop smoking techniques; Smoking cessation programs; Smoking cessation techniques
Information
It is hard to quit smoking if you are acting alone. Most smokers find it hard to break their ties to the smoking habit.
Smokers may have a much better chance of quitting when using a support program. Stop smoking programs are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations.
The best programs combine many approaches. All smoking cessation programs need to target the fears and problems you have when quitting. They also need to provide ongoing support for staying away from tobacco.
Be wary of programs that:
Are short and offer no help over time
Charge a high fee
Offer supplements or pills that are only available from the program
Promise an easy path to quitting
TELEPHONE-BASED HELP
Telephone-based services can help you design a stop smoking program that meets your needs. These are services are easy to use. The counselors can help you avoid common mistakes. This kind of support can be as effective as face-to-face counseling.
Telephone programs are often available nights and weekends. Trained counselors will help you decide which stop smoking aids to use. Choices may include medicines nicotine replacement therapy, and support programs or classes. They will help you set up a support network to help you quit.
You can find out about telephone counseling smoking cessation programs from:
Your doctor or local hospital
Your health insurance plan
Your employer
The National Cancer Institutes 800-QUIT-NOW (800-784-8669)
The American Cancer Societys Quitline at 800-ACS-2345 (800-227-2345)
The American Lung Association, which has online and phone advice programs
State programs in all 50 states and the District of Columbia
SUPPORT GROUPS
Let your friends, family, and coworkers know of your plan to stop smoking and your quit date. It helps for people around you to be aware of what youre going through -- especially when you are grumpy.
You may also want to seek out other types of support, such as:
Your family doctor or nurse
Groups of ex-smokers
Nicotine Anonymous. This organization uses a similar approach as Alcoholics Anonymous. As part of this group, you will be asked to admit that you are powerless over your addiction to nicotine. Also, a sponsor is often available to help you get through urges to smoke.
Check with your employer, health insurance plan, or health care provider about different types of support groups. Also, check the website of the American Cancer Society or American Lung Association for other resources.
STOP SMOKING PROGRAMS AND CLASSES
Stop smoking programs can also help you find a quitting method that suits your needs. They will help you be aware of problems that come up while youre trying to quit, and offer tools to cope with these problems. These programs can help you avoid making common mistakes.
Programs may either have one-on-one sessions or group counseling. Some programs offer both. Programs should be run by a counselors trained to help people quit smoking.
Programs that provide more sessions or longer sessions have a better chance of success. The American Cancer Society recommends programs with the following:
Each session lasts at least 15 - 30 minutes
There are at least four sessions
The program lasts at least 2 weeks -- longer is usually better
The leader is trained in smoking cessation
Hospitals, employers, and health insurance plans may offer this service. You can also the American Cancer Society and the American Lung Association, or your local health department to find programs.
Internet-based programs are also becoming more available. These services send you personalized reminders using e-mail, texting, or other methods.

83,Substance use disorder,[],2014-09-24 09:55:44,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"Definition
Substance use disorder occurs when a person needs alcohol or another substance (drug) to function normally. Abruptly stopping the substance leads to withdrawal symptoms.
Addiction means that a person has a strong urge to use the substance and cannot stop, even if they want to. Tolerance to a substance (needing a higher dose to get the same effect) is usually part of addiction.
This disorder is also called substance abuse.
Alternative Names
Substance abuse; Chemical use; Chemical abuse; Drug addiction; Addiction - drug; Dependence on drugs
Causes
The exact cause of substance use disorder is not known. A persons genes, the action of the drug, peer pressure, emotional distress, anxiety , depression , and environmental stress can all be factors.
At least half of those who become addicted have depression , attention deficit disorder , post-traumatic stress disorder , or another mental problem. A stressful or chaotic lifestyle and low self-esteem are also common.
Children who grow up seeing their parents using drugs may have a high risk of developing an addiction later in life for both environmental and genetic reasons.
Commonly abused substances include:
Opiates and narcotics are powerful painkillers that cause drowsiness and sometimes intense feelings of well-being, elation, happiness, excitement, and joy. These include heroin, opium, codeine, and narcotic pain medicines that may be prescribed by a doctor or bought illegally.
that may be prescribed by a doctor or bought illegally. Stimulants are drugs that stimulate the brain and nervous system. They include amphetamines, cocaine , and drugs used to treat ADHD, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin). A person can start needing higher amounts of these drugs to feel the same effect.
, and drugs used to treat ADHD, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin). A person can start needing higher amounts of these drugs to feel the same effect. Depressants cause drowsiness and reduce anxiety. They include alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines (Valium, Ativan, Xanax), chloral hydrate, and paraldehyde. Using these substances can lead to addiction.
LSD, mescaline, psilocybin (""mushrooms""), and phencyclidine (PCP or ""angel dust"") can cause a person to see things that are not there (hallucinations) and can lead to psychological addiction.
Marijuana (cannabis) and hashish
There are several stages of drug use that may lead to addiction. Young people seem to move more quickly through the stages than do adults. Stages are:
Experimental use -- typically involves peers, done for recreational use; the user may enjoy defying parents or other authority figures.
Regular use -- the user misses more and more school or work; worries about losing drug source; uses drugs to ""fix"" negative feelings; begins to stay away from friends and family; may change friends to those who are regular users; shows increased tolerance and ability to ""handle"" the drug.
Problem or risky use -- the user loses any motivation; does not care about school and work; has obvious behavior changes; thinking about drug use is more important than all other interests, including relationships; the user becomes secretive; may begin dealing drugs to help support habit; use of other, harder drugs may increase; legal problems may increase.
Addiction (dependence) -- cannot face daily life without drugs; denies problem; physical condition gets worse; loss of ""control"" over use; may become suicidal; financial and legal problems get worse; may have broken ties with family members or friends.
Symptoms
Symptoms and behaviors of drug useinclude:
Confusion
Continuing to use drugs even when health, work, or family are being harmed
Episodes of violence
Hostility when confronted about drug dependence
Lack of control over drug abuse - being unable to stop or reduce alcohol intake
Making excuses to use drugs
Missing work or school, or a decrease in performance
Need for daily or regular drug use to function
Neglecting to eat
Not caringabout physical appearance
No longer taking part in activities because of drug abuse
Secretive behavior to hide drug use
Using drugs even when alone
Exams and Tests
Drug tests (toxicology screens) on blood and urine samples can show many chemicals and drugs in the body. How sensitive the test is depends on the drug itself, when the drug was taken, and the testing laboratory. Blood tests are more likely to find a drug than urine tests, though urine drug screens are done more often.
Treatment
Substance use disorder is a serious condition and not easy to treat. The best care and treatment involves trained professionals.
Treatmentbegins with recognizing the problem. Though ""denial"" is a common symptom of addiction, people who are addicted have far less denial if they are treated with empathy and respect, rather than told what to do or being confronted.
The substance may either be slowly withdrawn or stopped abruptly. Support for physical and emotional symptoms, as well as staying drug free (abstinence) are also key to treatment:
People with drug overdose may need emergency treatment in the hospital. The exact treatment depends on the drug used.
Detoxification (detox) is the withdrawal of the substance abruptly in an environment where there is good support. Detoxification can be done on an inpatient or outpatient basis.
At times, another drug with a similar action or effect on the body is taken, as the dose is slowly decreased to reduce the side effects and risks of withdrawal. For example, with narcotic addiction, methadone or similar drugs may be used to prevent withdrawal and continued use.
Residential treatment programs monitor and address possible withdrawal symptoms and behaviors. These programs use techniques to get users to recognize their behaviors and learn how not to go back to using (relapse).
If the person also has depression or another mental health disorder, it should be treated. In many cases, a person starts using drugs to try to self-treat mental illness.
Support Groups
Many support groups are available in the community. They include Narcotics Anonymous (NA), Alateen, and Al-Anon. Most of these groups follow the 12-Step program used in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). SMART Recovery and LifeRing are programs that do not use the 12-step approach. You can find other support groups on the internet.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Substance use may lead to a fatal overdose. Some people start taking thesubstances again (relapse) after they have stopped.
Complications of substance use include:
Depression
Cancer-- for example, mouth and stomach cancer are linked to alcohol abuse and dependence
Infection with HIV, or hepatitis B or C through shared needles
Loss of job
Problems with memory and concentration-- for example with hallucinogen use, including marijuana (THC)
Problems with the law
Relationship breakup
Unsafe sexual practices, which may result in unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV, or hepatitis B
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you or a family member is addicted to drugs and would like to get off of them. Also call if you have been cut off from your drug supply and are at risk of withdrawal. Most employers also offer referral services for their employees with substance use problems.
Prevention
Drug education programs can be helpful. Parents can have a strong influence on their children by teaching them about the harms of using substances.

84,Pathological gambling,[],2014-09-24 09:55:29,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"Definition
Pathological gambling is being unable to resist impulses to gamble, which can lead to severe personal or social consequences.
Alternative Names
Gambling - compulsive; Compulsive gambling; Addictive gambling
Causes
Pathological gambling usually begins in early adolescence in men, and between ages 20 and 40 in women.
Pathological gambling often involves repetitive behaviors. People with this problem have a hard time resisting or controlling the impulse to gamble. Although it shares features of obsessive compulsive disorder, pathological gambling is likely a different condition.
In people who develop pathological gambling, occasional gambling leads to a gambling habit. Stressful situations can worsen gambling problems.
Symptoms
People with pathological gambling often feel ashamed and try to avoid letting other people know about their problem. The American Psychiatric Association defines pathological gambling as having five or more of the following symptoms:
Committing crimes to get money to gamble
Feeling restless or irritable when trying to cut back or quit gambling
Gambling to escape problems or feelings of sadness or anxiety
Gambling larger amounts of money to try to make back past losses
Losing a job, relationship, education, or career opportunity due to gambling
Lying about the amount of time or money spent gambling
Making many unsuccessful attempts to cut back or quit gambling
Needing to borrow money due to gambling losses
Needing to gamble larger amounts of money in order to feel excitement
Spending a lot of time thinking about gambling, such as remembering past experiences or ways to get more money with which to gamble
Exams and Tests
A psychiatric evaluation and history can be used to diagnose pathological gambling. Screening tools such as the Gamblers Anonymous 20 Questions can help with the diagnosis.
Treatment
Treatment for people with pathological gambling begins with recognizing the problem. Pathological gamblers often deny they have a problem or need treatment.
Most people with pathological gambling only get treated when other people pressure them.
Treatment options include:
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
Self-help support groups , such as Gamblers Anonymous. Gamblers Anonymous is a 12-step program similar to Alcoholics Anonymous. Practices used to treat other types of addiction, such as substance abuse and alcohol dependence , can also be helpful in treating pathological gambling.
A few studies have been done on medications for treating pathological gambling. Early results suggest that antidepressants and opioid antagonists (naltrexone) may help treat the symptoms of pathological gambling. However, it is not yet clear which people will respond to medications.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Like alcohol or drug addiction, pathological gambling is a long-term disorder that tends to get worse without treatment. Even with treatment, its common to start gambling again (relapse). However, people with pathological gambling can do very well with the right treatment.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Alcohol and drug abuse problems
Anxiety
Depression
Financial, social, and legal problems (including bankruptcy, divorce, job loss, time in prison)
Heart attacks (from the stress and excitement of gambling)
Suicide attempts
Getting the right treatment can help prevent many of these problems.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Call your health care provider or mental health professional if you believe you have symptoms of pathological gambling.
Prevention
Exposure to gambling may increase the risk of developing pathological gambling. Limiting exposure may be helpful for people who are at risk.
Public exposure to gambling, however, continues to increase in the form of lotteries, electronic and Internet gambling, and casinos. Intervention at the earliest signs of pathological gambling may prevent the disorder from getting worse.

85,Fetal alcohol syndrome,[],2014-09-24 09:55:10,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"Definition
Fetal alcohol syndrome is growth, mental, and physical problems that may occur in a baby when a mother drinks alcohol during pregnancy.
Alternative Names
Alcohol in pregnancy; Alcohol-related birth defects; Fetal alcohol effects; FAS
Causes, incidence, and risk factors
Using or abusing alcohol during pregnancy can cause the same risks as using alcohol in general. However, it poses extra risks to the unborn baby. When a pregnant woman drinks alcohol, it easily passes across the placenta to the fetus. Because of this, drinking alcohol can harm the babys development.
A pregnant woman who drinks any amount of alcohol is at risk for having a child with fetal alcohol syndrome. No ""safe"" level of alcohol use during pregnancy has been established. Larger amounts of alcohol appear to increase the problems. Binge drinking is more harmful than drinking small amounts of alcohol.
Timing of alcohol use during pregnancy is also important. Alcohol use appears to be the most harmful during the first 3 months of pregnancy; however, drinking alcohol any time during pregnancy can be harmful.
Symptoms
A baby with fetal alcohol syndrome may have the following symptoms:
Poor growth while the baby is in the womb and after birth
Decreased muscle tone and poor coordination
Delayed development and problems in three or more major areas: thinking, speech, movement, or social skills
Heart defects such as ventricular septal defect (VSD) or atrial septal defect (ASD)
or Problems with the face, including: Narrow, small eyes with large epicanthal folds Small head Small upper jaw Smooth groove in upper lip Smooth and thin upper lip
Signs and tests
A physical exam of the baby may show a heart murmur or other heart problems. As the baby grows, there may be signs of delayed mental development. There also may be problems with the face and bones.
Tests include:
Blood alcohol level in pregnant women who show signs of being drunk (intoxicated)
Brain imaging studies (CT or MRI) after the child is born
Pregnancy ultrasound
Treatment
Women who are pregnant or who are trying to get pregnant should avoid drinking any amount of alcohol. Pregnant women with alcoholism should join an alcohol abuse rehabilitation program and be checked closely by a health care provider throughout pregnancy.
Support Groups
The following organizations may offer assistance:
National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependency -- www.ncadd.org
National Drug and Alcohol Treatment Referral Routing Service -- 1-800-662-4357
The following organizations are good resources for information on alcoholism:
Alcoholics Anonymous - www.alcoholics-anonymous.org
Al-Anon/Alateen - www.al-anon.org
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism - www.niaaa.nih.gov/
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration - www.samhsa.gov
Expectations (prognosis)
The outcome for infants with fetal alcohol syndrome varies. Almost none of these babies have normal brain development.
Infants and children with fetal alcohol syndrome have many different problems, which can be difficult to manage. Children do best if they are diagnosed early and referred to a team of health care providers who can work on educational and behavioral strategies that fit the childs needs.
Complications
Drinking alcohol during pregnancy may result in:
Miscarriage or stillbirth
or Premature delivery
Complications seen in the infant may include:
Abnormal heart structure
Behavior problems
Infant death
Intellectual disability
Problems in the structure of the head, eyes, nose, or mouth
Poor growth before birth
Slow growth and poor coordination after birth
Calling your health care provider
Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you are drinking alcohol regularly or heavily, and are finding it difficult to cut back or stop. Also, call if you are drinking alcohol in any amount while you are pregnant or trying to get pregnant.
Prevention
Avoiding alcohol during pregnancy prevents fetal alcohol syndrome. Counseling can help women who have already had a child with fetal alcohol syndrome.
Sexually active women who drink heavily should use birth control and control their drinking behaviors, or stop using alcohol before trying to get pregnant.

Information
MARIJUANA
Marijuana is also called ""grass,"" ""pot,"" ""reefer,"" ""joint,"" ""hashish,"" ""cannabis,"" ""weed,"" and ""Mary Jane.""
About 2 in 5 Americans have used marijuana at least once in their life.
Marijuana comes from a plant called hemp (Cannabis sativa). The main, active ingredient in marijuana is THC (short for delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol). This and other ingredients, called cannabinoids, are found in the leaves and flowering parts of the marijuana plant. Hashish is a substance taken from the tops of female marijuana plants. It contains the highest amount of THC.
How fast you feel the effects of marijuana depend on how you use it:
If you breathe in marijuana smoke (such as from a joint or pipe), you may feel the effects within seconds to several minutes.
If you eat foods containing the drug (such as ""hash brownies,"") you may feel the effects within 30 - 60 minutes.
Marijuana acts on your central nervous system. Low to moderate amounts of the drug may cause:
Increased appetite (""the munchies"")
Feeling of joy (euphoria)
Relaxed feeling
Increased sensations of sight, hearing, and taste
Other effects can include:
Feelings of panic
Anxiety
Excessive fear (paranoia)
Decreased ability to perform tasks that require coordination (such as driving a car)
Decreased interest in completing tasks
Delirium
Firmly held false beliefs (delusions)
Seeing or hearing things that arent there (hallucinations)
Bloodshot eyes
Increased heart rate and blood pressure
Infections such as sinusitis , bronchitis , and asthma in heavy users
Irritation of the airways causing narrowing or spasms
Possibly weakening of the immune system
Sore throat
Trouble concentrating and paying attention, which can interfere with learning
Trouble telling oneself from others
Violence (may be related to marijuana that is laced with a drug called PCP)
Regular users may have withdrawal effects when they stop marijuana use. These may include:
Agitation
Anxiety
Insomnia
Irritability
MEDICAL MARIJUANA
The medical use of marijuana is controversial, yet its active ingredient (THC) is legal for medical purposes in at least 16 states. (Whole marijuana is illegal, even for medical use.)
THC has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the following medical purposes:
Relieving chronic pain and spasticity
Stimulating appetite in patients with AIDS or who have undergone chemotherapy
Treating glaucoma
Treating nausea caused by chemotherapy in cancer patients
PHENCYCLIDINE (PCP, ""angel dust"")
PCP is an illegal drug that comes as a white powder, which can be dissolved in alcohol or water. PCP may be smoked, shot into a vein, or taken by mouth. How quickly it affects you depends on how you take it.
Shooting up: If given through a vein, PCPs effects start within 2-5 minutes.
Smoked: The effects begin within 2 - 5 minutes, peaking at 15 - 30 minutes.
Taken by mouth: In pill form, or mixed with food or drinks, PCPs effects usually start within 30 minutes. The effects tend to peak in about 2 - 5 hours.
Different doses of PCP may cause different effects:
Lower doses of PCP typically produce feelings of joy (euphoria) and less inhibition, similar to being drunk.
Higher doses can cause numbness throughout the body, and perception changes that may lead to extreme anxiety and violence.
Large doses may produce paranoia, ""hearing voices"" (auditory hallucinations), and other forms of psychosis , similar to schizophrenia .
, similar to . Massive doses, usually from taking the drug by mouth, may cause kidney failure , heart arrhythmias , muscle rigidity , seizures , and even death.
Because of the pain-killing ( analgesic ) properties of PCP, users who get seriously injured may not feel any pain.
LSD AND OTHER HALLUCINOGENS
LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) is a strong hallucinogen. Only tiny amounts are needed to cause effects, such as hallucinations.
LSD use may cause:
Anxiety
Blurred vision
Dilated pupils
Seeing things that arent there ( hallucinations )
) Paranoia and other delusions
Tremors
Other commonly abused hallucinogens include:
Psilocybin (mushrooms, ""'shrooms"")
Peyote (a cactus plant containing the active ingredient mescaline)
Hallucinogens can lead to extreme anxiety and loss of touch with reality, called ""bad trips"". These experiences can come back as a ""flashback,"" even without using the drug again. Such experiences typically occur during times of increased stress, and tend to occur less often and intensely after stopping the drugs.
COCAINE
Cocaine is a strong stimulant. The abuse of cocaine increased dramatically in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but is now on the decline. Other names to describe different forms of cocaine include ""crack,"" ""coke,"" ""snow,"" and ""speedball.""
Cocaine may be taken in different ways:
Snorting: Inhaling it through the nose
Shooting up: Dissolving it in water and injecting it into a vein
Speedball: Mixing with heroin and injecting into a vein
Smoked: Cocaine may be changed into smokeable forms known as freebase or crack
Smoking cocaine typically produces a nearly instant and intense sense of joy (euphoria). Other effects include:
Feelings of increased confidence and energy
Less inhibition
Local numbness
Regular users of cocaine may need larger amounts of the drug to feel these effects. Regular users of cocaine may develop:
Loss of interest in school, work, family, and friends
Memory loss
Mood swings
Sleep problems
Social withdrawal
Heart disease and other blood vessel disease
A hole in the septum that separates the nostrils
Heavy use may cause paranoia, which can lead to violence.
AMPHETAMINES
Amphetamines are stimulants. Other names used to describe amphetamines or methamphetamines include ""crystal,"" ""go,"" ""crank,"" and ""cross-tops.""
Amphetamines can be very addictive. Prescription amphetamines are considered controlled substances. Over-the-counter (OTC) amphetamine look-alike drugs are often abused. These drugs typically contain caffeine and other stimulants, and are sold as appetite suppressants or stay-awake/stay-alert aids.
Signs and symptoms of stimulant use include:
Dilated pupils
Exaggerated feeling of well-being (euphoria)
Fast heart rate
Restlessness and hyperactivity
Skin flushing
Sleep disturbances
Tremors
Appetite decrease and weight loss
INHALANTS
Inhalant use became popular with young teens in the 1960s with ""glue sniffing."" Since then, a greater variety of inhalants have become popular. Inhalant use typically involves younger teens or school-age children.
Commonly abused inhalants include:
Aerosols for deodorants or hair sprays
Cleaning fluids
Gasoline
Liquid typewriter correction fluid
Model glue
Spray paints
Negative effects of inhalant abuse include:
Brain damage
Convulsions
Liver or kidney damage
Nerve damage ( peripheral neuropathy )
Sudden death
OPIATES, OPIOIDS, AND NARCOTICS
Opiates come from opium poppies. These drugs include morphine and codeine. Opioids are artificial substances that have the same effect as morphine or codeine. The term ""narcotic"" refers to either type of drug.
Narcotics are powerful painkillers that cause drowsiness (sedation) and, sometimes, feelings of euphoria.
These drugs include:
Codeine
Heroin
Hydromorphone (Dilaudid)
Methadone
Meperidine (Demerol)
Opium
Oxycodone (Percocet or Oxycontin)
Signs and symptoms of narcotic use include:
Sedation
Needle marks on the skin (""tracks""), scars or abscesses if drug use is by injection
if drug use is by injection Relaxed or euphoric state
Small ""pinpoint"" pupils
Coma, respiratory depression, and death in high doses
Because heroin is commonly injected into a vein (used intravenously), there are health concerns about sharing contaminated needles among IV drug users. Complications of sharing contaminated needles include hepatitis , HIV infection, and AIDS .
CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSANTS
These substances produce sedating and anxiety-reducing effects, which may be therapeutic in some cases and lead to abuse or dependence in others.
These types of drugs include:
Alcohol
Barbiturates (e.g. amobarbital, pentobarbital, secobarbital), also called ""yellow jackets""
Benzodiazepines (e.g. Valium, Ativan, Xanax)
Chloral hydrate
Paraldehyde
Signs and symptoms of excessive alcohol or other depressant use include:
Decreased attention span
Impaired judgment
Lack of coordination
Slurred speech
OTHER DRUGS
A number of other illegal drugs have become popular and available in recent years, including:
Ketamine, a substance related to PCP, commonly called ""Special K""
""Ecstasy,"" or MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine)
GHB and Rohypnol, also called ""date rape,"" ""acquaintance rape,"" or ""drug-assisted assault"" drugs

87,Delirium tremens,[],2014-09-24 09:55:07,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"Definition
Delirium tremens is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that involves sudden and severe mental or nervous system changes.
Alternative Names
DTs; Alcohol withdrawal - delirium tremens
Causes
Delirium tremens can occur when you stop drinking alcohol after a period of heavy drinking, especially if you do not eat enough food.
Delirium tremens may also be caused by head injury, infection, or illness in people with a history of heavy alcohol use.
It is most common in people who have a history of alcohol withdrawal . It is especially common in those who drink 4 - 5 pints of wine or 7 - 8 pints of beer (or 1 pint of ""hard"" alcohol) every day for several months. Delirium tremens also commonly affects people who have had an alcohol habit or alcoholism for more than 10 years.
Symptoms
Symptoms most often occur within 48-96 hours after the last drink. However, they may occur up to 7 - 10 days after the last drink.
Symptoms may get worse quickly, and can include:
Body tremors
Changes in mental function
Agitation, irritability
Confusion , disorientation
, disorientation Decreased attention span
Deep sleep that lasts for a day or longer
Delirium
Excitement
Fear
Hallucinations (seeing or feeling things that are not really there)
(seeing or feeling things that are not really there) Increased activity
Quick mood changes
Restlessness , excitement
, excitement Sensitivity to light, sound, touch
Stupor , sleepiness, fatigue
Seizures (may occur without other symptoms of DTs)
Most common in first 12 - 48 hours after last drink
Most common in people with past complications from alcohol withdrawal
Usually generalized tonic-clonic seizures
Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including:
Anxiety
Depression
Fatigue
Feeling jumpy or nervous
Feeling shaky
Headache
Insomnia (difficulty falling and staying asleep)
Irritability or excitability
Loss of appetite
Nausea
Pale skin
Palpitations (sensation of feeling the heart beat)
(sensation of feeling the heart beat) Rapid emotional changes
Sweating , especially on the palms of the hands or the face
, especially on the palms of the hands or the face Vomiting
Other symptoms that may occur:
Chest pain
Fever
Stomach pain
Exams and Tests
Delirium tremens is a medical emergency.
The health care provider will perform a physical exam. Signs may include:
Heavy sweating
Increased startle reflex
Irregular heartbeat
Problems with eye muscle movement
Rapid heart rate
Rapid muscle tremors
The following tests may be done:
Blood magnesium level
Blood phosphate level
Comprehensive metabolic panel
Electrocardiogram (ECG)
(ECG) Electroencephalogram (EEG)
Toxicology screen
Treatment
The goals of treatment are to:
Save the persons life
Relieve symptoms
Prevent complications
A hospital stay is needed. The health care team will regularly check:
Blood chemistry results, such as electrolyte levels
Body fluid levels
Vital signs (temperature, pulse, rate of breathing, blood pressure)
Symptoms such as agitation, seizures, and irregular heartbeat are treated with the following medications:
Sedatives such as diazepam or lorazepam
Anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital
The patient may need to be put into a sedated state for a week or more until withdrawal and DTs are finished. Benzodiazepine medications such as diazepam or lorazepam also help treat seizures, anxiety, and tremors.
Antipsychotic medications such as haloperidol may sometimes be needed for persons with severe psychotic symptoms, especially if they have an underlying problem such as schizophrenia. However, these drugs should be avoided if possible because they may contribute to seizures.
Long-term preventive treatment should begin after the patient recovers from immediate symptoms. This may involve a ""drying out"" period, in which no alcohol is allowed. Total and lifelong avoidance of alcohol (abstinence) is recommended for most people who go through withdrawal. The person should receive treatment for alcohol use or alcoholism, including:
Counseling
Support groups (such as Alcoholics Anonymous)
The patient should be tested, and if needed, treated for other medical problems that can occur with alcohol use. Such problems may include:
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy
Alcoholic liver disease
Alcoholic neuropathy
Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome
Support Groups
For additional resources, see alcoholism support group .
Outlook (Prognosis)
Delirium tremens is serious and may be life-threatening. Some symptoms related to alcohol withdrawal may last for a year or more, including:
Emotional mood swings
Feeling tired
Sleeplessness
Possible Complications
Injury from falls during seizures
Injury to self or others caused by mental state (confusion/delirium)
Irregular heartbeat, may be life threatening
Seizures
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have symptoms. Delirium tremens is an emergency condition.
Prevention

Cocaine withdrawal occurs when a heavy cocaine user cuts down or quits taking the drug. Complete abstinence and a serum drug level of zero are not required.
Causes
Cocaine produces a sense of extreme joy by causing the brain to release higher than normal amounts of some biochemicals. However, cocaines effects on other parts of the body can be very serious or even deadly.
When cocaine use is stopped or when a binge ends, a crash follows almost immediately. This crash is accompanied by a strong craving for more cocaine. Additional symptoms include fatigue, lack of pleasure, anxiety, irritability, sleepiness, and sometimes agitation or extreme suspicion or paranoia.
Cocaine withdrawal often has no visible physical symptoms like the vomiting and shaking that accompanies the withdrawal from heroin or alcohol.
In the past, people underestimated the how addictive cocaine can be. However, cocaine is addictive when addiction is defined as a desire for more of the drug, despite negative consequences.
The level of craving, irritability, delayed depression, and other symptoms produced by cocaine withdrawal rivals or exceeds that felt with other withdrawal syndromes.

Stroke secondary to cocaine
Symptoms
Primary symptoms may include:
Agitation and restless behavior
Depressed mood
Fatigue
Generalized malaise
Increased appetite
Vivid and unpleasant dreams
Slowing of activity
The craving and depression can last for months following cessation of long-term heavy use (particularly daily). Withdrawal symptoms may also be associated with suicidal thoughts in some people.
During withdrawal, there can be powerful, intense cravings for cocaine. However, the ""high"" associated with ongoing use becomes less and less pleasant, and can produce fear and extreme suspicion rather than joy (euphoria). Just the same, the cravings may remain powerful.
Exams and Tests
A physical examination and history of cocaine use are sufficient to diagnose this condition.
A toxicology (poison) screen may be performed to see if other drugs may have been taken.
Other routinetests may include:
Blood chemistries and liver function tests such as CHEM-20
Cardiac enzymes (look for evidence of heart damage or heart attack)
CBC (complete blood count, measures red and white blood cells, and platelets, which help blood to clot)
EKG (heart tracing)
Chest x-ray
Urinalysis
Treatment
The withdrawal from cocaine may not be as unstable as withdrawal from alcohol. However, the withdrawal from any chronic substance abuse is very serious. There is a risk of suicide or overdose.
Symptoms usually disappear over time. People who have cocaine withdrawal will often use alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, or anti-anxiety medications such as diazepam (Valium) or lorazepam (Ativan)to treat their symptoms. Use of these drugs is not recommended because it simply shifts addiction from one substance to another.
At least half of all people addicted to cocaine also have a mental disorder (particularly depression and attention-deficit disorder). These conditions should be suspected and treated. When diagnosed and treated, relapse rates are dramatically reduced. All prescription drug use should be monitored carefully in patients who abuse substances.
Support Groups
The 12-step support groups, such as Cocaine Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous, have helped many people addicted to cocaine. Alternative groups such as SMART recovery should be recommended for those who do not like the 12-step approach.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Cocaine addiction is difficult to treat, and relapse can occur. However, the rates of achieving stabilization are as good as those for other chronic illnesses like diabetes and asthma.
Treatment should start with the least restrictive option and move up if necessary. Outpatient care is as effective as inpatient care for most people addicted to cocaine, according to research.
Presently there are no effective medications for reducing craving, although some are being tested. Some studies have reported that medications such as amantadine and bromocriptine may help to reduce patients craving, increase energy, and normalize sleep, particularly among those with the most seriously addicted.
Possible Complications
Depression
Craving and overdose
Suicide
Because many users will abuse more than one drug, other withdrawal syndromes, such as alcohol withdrawal, need to be ruled out.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Call your health care provider if you use cocaine and need help to stop using it.
Prevention
Avoid cocaine use. If you have previously used cocaine and wish to stop, try to avoid people, places, and things you associate with the drug. If you find yourself considering the euphoria produced by cocaine, force yourself to think of the negative consequences that follow its use. Group participation is helpful for many people.

90,Alcoholic neuropathy,[],2014-09-24 09:54:54,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"Definition
Alcoholic neuropathy is damage to the nerves that results from excessive drinking of alcohol.
Alternative Names
Neuropathy - alcoholic; Alcoholic polyneuropathy
Causes
The exact cause of alcoholic neuropathy is unknown. Itlikely includes both a direct poisoning of the nerve by the alcohol and the effect of poor nutrition associated with alcoholism. Up to half of long-term heavy alcohol users develop this condition.
In severe cases, nerves that regulate internal body functions (autonomic nerves) may be involved.
Risksof alcoholic neuropathy include:
Long-term, heavy alcohol use
Alcoholism that is present for 10 years or more
Symptoms
Numbness in the arms and legs
in the arms and legs Abnormal sensations , such as""pins and needles""
, such as""pins and needles"" Painful sensations in the arms and legs
Muscle weakness
Muscle cramps or muscle aches
or Heat intolerance , especially after exercise
, especially after exercise Impotence (in men)
(in men) Problems urinating , incontinence (leaking urine), feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, difficulty beginning to urinate
, (leaking urine), feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, Constipation
Diarrhea
Nausea, vomiting
Additional symptoms that may occur with this disease:
Swallowing difficulty
Speech impairment
Loss of muscle function or feeling
Muscle contractions or spasm
or spasm Muscle atrophy
Movement disorders
Changes in muscle strength or sensation usually occur on both sides of the body and are more common in the legs than in the arms. Symptoms usually develop gradually and become worse over time.
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. An eye exam may show eye problems.
Alcoholism often makes your body unable to use or store certain vitamins and minerals. Blood tests will beordered to check for a deficiency (lack of):
Thiamine (vitamin B1)
Pyridoxine (vitamin B6)
Pantothenic acid and biotin
Vitamin B12
Folic acid
Niacin (vitamin B3)
Vitamin A
Additional tests may beordered to rule out other possible causes of neuropathy. Tests may include:
Electrolyte levels
Electromyography ( EMG )
Liver and kidney function tests
Thyroid function tests
Levels of vitamins and minerals in the body
Nerve conduction tests
Nerve biopsy
Upper GI and small bowel series
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD )
) Voiding cystourethrogram
Treatment
Once the alcohol problem has been addressed, treatment goals include:
Controlling symptoms
Maximizing ability to function independently
Preventing injury
It is important to supplement the diet with vitamins, including thiamine and folic acid.
Physical therapy and orthopedic appliances (such as splints) may be needed tomake suremuscle function and limb position are maintained.
Medicines may be neededto treat pain or uncomfortable sensations.Because persons with alcoholic neuropathy have alcohol dependence problems, theyare advised to take the least amount of medicine needed to reduce symptoms to help prevent drug dependence and other side effects of chronic use.
Positioning or the use of a bed frame that keeps the covers off the legs may reduce pain for some people.
Light-headedness or dizziness when standing up (orthostatic hypotension) may require several different treatments before finding one that successfully reduces symptoms. Treatments that may help include:
Wearing compression stockings
Eating extra salt
Sleeping with the head elevated
Using medicines
Bladderproblems may be treated with:
Manual expression of urine
Intermittent catheterization ( male or female )
Medicines
Impotence, diarrhea, constipation, or other symptoms are treated when necessary. These symptoms often respond poorly to treatment in people with alcoholic neuropathy.
It is important to protect body parts with reduced sensation from injury. This may include:
Checking the temperature of bath water to prevent burns
Changing footwear
Frequently inspecting the feet and shoes to reduce injury caused by pressure or objects in the shoes
Guarding the extremities to prevent injury from pressure
Alcohol must be stopped to prevent the damage from getting worse. Treatment for alcoholism may include counseling or social support such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), or taking medicines.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Damage to nerves from alcoholic neuropathy is usually permanent.It is likely to get worse ifthe personcontinues to use alcohol orif nutritional problems are notcorrected. Alcoholic neuropathyis usually not life-threatening, but itcan severely affect quality of life.
Possible Complications
Disability
Long-term (chronic) discomfort or pain
Injury to extremities
Falling, especially at night
Urinary incontinence or retention
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of alcoholic neuropathy.
Prevention
The only way to prevent alcoholic neuropathy is not to drink alcohol.

Alcoholism and alcohol abuse are two types of problem drinking.
Alcoholism is when your drinking causes serious problems in your life, yet you keep drinking. You also may have a physical dependence on alcohol. This means that you need more and more alcohol to feel drunk. Stopping suddenly may cause withdrawal symptoms .
Alcohol abuse is when your drinking leads to problems, but you are not physically dependent on alcohol. These problems may occur:
At work, school, or home
In your personal relationships
With the law
From using alcohol in dangerous situations, such as drinking and driving
Alternative Names
Alcohol dependence; Alcohol abuse; Problem drinking; Drinking problem; Alcohol addiction
Causes
No one knows what causes problems with alcohol. Health experts think that it may be a combination of a person's:
Genes
Environment
Psychology, such as being impulsive or having low self-esteem
Drinking a lot of alcohol can put you at risk for alcohol problems. You are more at risk for alcoholism if:
You are a man who has 15 or more drinks a week
You are a woman who has 12 or more drinks a week
You have five or more drinks at a time at least once a week
One drink is defined as a 12-ounce bottle of beer, a 5-ounce glass of wine, or a 1 1/2-ounce shot of liquor.
If you have a parent with alcoholism, you are more at risk for alcohol problems.
You also may be more likely to abuse alcohol or become dependent if:
You are a young adult under peer pressure
You have depression, bipolar disorder , anxiety disorders , or schizophrenia
, , or You have easy access to alcohol
You have low self-esteem
You have problems with relationships
You live a stressful lifestyle
Alcohol abuse is on the rise. In the U.S., about 3 out of 10 people drink at a level that puts them at risk for alcoholism.
If you are concerned about your drinking, it may help to take a careful look at your alcohol use .
Symptoms
If you have a drinking problem, you may:
Continue to drink, even when your health, work, or family are being harmed
Drink alone
Become stirred up, excited, or tense when drinking
Become hostile when asked about your drinking
Make excuses to drink
Miss work or school, or don't perform as well because of drinking
Stop taking part in activities you enjoy because of alcohol
Need to use alcohol on most days to get through the day
Don't eat a lot or eat poorly
Not care about how you dress or if you are clean
Try to hide alcohol use
Shake in the morning or after periods when you have not had a drink
Symptoms of alcohol dependence include:
Needing more and more alcohol to feel drunk
Alcohol withdrawal symptoms when you havent had a drink for a while
when you havent had a drink for a while Illnesses from alcohol use, such as alcoholic liver disease
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will:
Examine you
Ask questions about your medical and family history
Ask about your alcohol use
These questions from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism can help screen for an alcohol problem:
Do you ever drive when you have been drinking?
Do you have to drink more than before to get drunk or feel the desired effect?
Have you felt that you should cut down on your drinking?
Have you ever had any blackouts after drinking?
Have you ever missed work or lost a job because of drinking?
Is someone in your family worried about your drinking?
Your health care provider may order tests to check for health problems that are common in people who abuse alcohol. These tests may include:
Blood alcohol level (This shows if you have recently been drinking alcohol. It does not diagnose alcoholism.)
Complete blood count
Liver function tests
Magnesium blood test
Treatment
Many people with an alcohol problem need to completely stop using alcohol. This is called abstinence. Having strong social and family support can help make it easier to quit drinking.
Some people are able to just cut back on their drinking. So even if you don't give up alcohol altogether, you may be able to drink less . This can improve your health and relationships with others. It can also help you perform better at work or school.
However, many people who drink too much find they can't just cut back. Abstinence may be the only way to manage a drinking problem.
DECIDING TO QUIT
Like many people with an alcohol problem, you may not recognize that your drinking has gotten out of hand. An important first step is to be aware of how much you drink . It also helps to understand the health risks of alcohol .
If you decide to quit drinking , talk with your health care provider. Treatment involves helping you realize how much your alcohol use is harming your life and the lives those around you.
Depending on how much and how long you've been drinking, you may be at risk for alcohol withdrawal . Withdrawal can be very uncomfortable and even life-threatening. If you have been drinking a lot, you should cut back or stop drinking only under the care of a doctor. Talk with your health care provider about how to stop using alcohol.
LONG-TERM SUPPORT
Alcohol recovery or support programs can help you stop drinking completely. These programs usually offer:
Education about alcoholism and its effects
Counseling and therapy to discuss how to control your thoughts and behaviors
Physical health care
For the best chance of success, you should live with people who support your efforts to avoid alcohol. Some programs offer housing options for people with alcohol problems. Depending on your needs and the programs that are available:
You may be treated in a special recovery center (inpatient)
You may attend a program while you live at home (outpatient)
You may be prescribed medicines to help you quit. They are often used with long-term counseling or support groups.
These drugs make it less likely that you will drink again or help limit the amount you drink.
Acamprosate may help prevent relapse.
Disulfiram (Antabuse) produces very unpleasant side effects if you drink even a small amount of alcohol.
Naltrexone (Vivitrol) decreases alcohol cravings. It is available in a pill or as an injection.
Drinking may mask depression or other mood or anxiety disorders. If you have a mood disorder, it may become more noticeable when you stop drinking. Your health care provider will treat any mental disorders in addition to your alcohol treatment.
Support Groups
Support groups help many people who are dealing with alcoholism.
ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS (AA)
Alcoholics Anonymous is a self-help group of recovering alcoholics. Meetings offer emotional support and specific steps for people recovering from alcohol abuse or dependence. The program is commonly called a ""12-step"" approach. There are local chapters throughout the U.S. AA offers help 24 hours a day.
AL-ANON
Family members of a person with an alcohol problem often benefit from talking with others. Al-Anon is a support group for people who are affected by another persons drinking problem.
Alateen provides support for teenage children of people with alcoholism.
OTHER SUPPORT GROUPS
Several other support groups are available.
SMART recovery teaches ways to change thoughts and behaviors to help people recover from alcoholism.
LifeRing recovery and Secular Organizations for Sobriety (SOS) are two non-religious programs that offer support for people with alcoholism.
Women for Sobriety is a self-help group just for women.
Moderation Management is a program for those who want to reduce how much they drink. It recommends abstinence for people who cannot do this.
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well a person with alcoholism or alcohol abuse does depends on whether they can successfully cut back or stop drinking.
It may take several tries to stop drinking for good. If you are struggling to quit, don't give up hope. Getting treatment, if needed, along with support and encouragement from support groups and those around you can help you remain sober.
Possible Complications
Alcoholism and alcohol abuse can increase your risk of many health problems, including:
Bleeding in the digestive tract
Brain cell damage
A brain disorder called Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome
Cancer of the esophagus, liver, colon, and other areas
Changes in the menstrual cycle
Delirium tremens (DTs)
Dementia and memory loss
and memory loss Depression and suicide
and suicide Erectile dysfunction
Heart damage
High blood pressure
Inflammation of the pancreas ( pancreatitis )
) Liver disease, including cirrhosis
Nerve damage
Poor nutrition
Sleeping problems (insomnia)
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
Alcohol use also increases your risk for violence.
Drinking alcohol while you are pregnant can lead to severe birth defects in the baby.This is called fetal alcohol syndrome .
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Talk with your doctor if you or someone you know may have an alcohol problem.
Seek immediate medical care or call your local emergency number (such as 911) if you or someone you know has alcohol dependence and develops severe confusion, seizures, or bleeding.
Prevention
The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism recommends:
Women should not drink more than 1 drink per day
Men should not drink more than 2 drinks per day

93,Alcohol use and safe drinking,[],2014-09-24 09:54:54,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"Definition
Alcohol use involves drinking beer, wine, or hard liquor.
Alternative Names
Beer consumption; Wine consumption; Hard liquor consumption; Safe drinking
Information
Alcohol is one of the most widely used drug substances in the world.
TEEN DRINKING
Alcohol use is not only an adult problem. Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month, despite the fact that the legal drinking age is 21 years old in the U.S.
About 1 in 5 teens are considered ""problem drinkers."" This means that they:
Get drunk
Have accidents related to alcohol use
Get into trouble with the law, family members, friends, school, or dates because of alcohol
THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL
Alcoholic drinks have different amounts of alcohol in them:
Beeris about 5% alcohol, although some beers can have more.
Wine is usually 12 to 15% alcohol.
Hard liquor is about 45% alcohol.
Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly.
The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly.
Certain types of alcoholic drinks get into your bloodstream faster. A carbonated (fizzy) alcoholic drink, such as champagne, will be absorbed faster than a non-carbonated drink.
Alcohol slows your breathing rate, heart rate, and how well your brain functions. These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your ""blood alcohol level."" If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises.
Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The blood alcohol legal limit usually falls between 0.08 and 0.10 in most states. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms.
0.05 -- reduced inhibitions
0.10 -- slurred speech
0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment
0.30 -- confusion
0.40 -- stupor
0.50 -- coma
0.60 -- respiratory paralysis and death
You can have symptoms of ""being drunk"" at blood alcohol levels below the legal definition of being drunk. Also, people who drink alcohol frequently may not have symptoms until a higher blood alcohol level is reached.
HEALTH RISKS OF ALCOHOL
Alcohol increases the risk of:
Alcoholism or alcohol dependence
Falls, drownings, and other accidents
Head, neck, stomach, and breast cancers
Motor vehicle accidents
Risky sex behaviors, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
Suicide and homicide
Drinking during pregnancy can harm the developing baby. Severe birth defects or fetal alcohol syndrome are possible.
RESPONSIBLE DRINKING
If you drink alcohol, it is best to do so in moderation. Moderation means the drinking is not getting you intoxicated (or drunk) and you are drinking no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman and no more than 2 if you are a man. A drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1 ounces of liquor.
Here are some ways to drink responsibly, provided you do not have a drinking problem, are of legal age to drink alcohol, and are not pregnant:
Never drink alcohol and drive a car.
If you are going to drink, have a designated driver, or plan an alternative way home, such as a taxi or bus.
Do not drink on an empty stomach. Snack before and while drinking alcohol.
If you are taking medication, including over-the-counter drugs, check with your doctor before drinking alcohol. Alcohol can make the effects of many medicines stronger. It can also interact with other medicines, making them ineffective or dangerous or make you sick.
Do not drink if you have a history of alcohol abuse or alcoholism.
If alcoholism runs in your family, you may be at increased risk of developing alcoholism yourself, so you may want to avoid drinking alcohol altogether.
CALL YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IF:
You are concerned about your personal alcohol use or that of a family member
You are interested in more information regarding alcohol use, alcohol abuse , or support groups
, or support groups You are unable to reduce or stop your alcohol consumption, in spite of attempts to stop drinking

Public or private mental health agencies
School or work counselors
Student or employee health centers

94,Alcohol withdrawal,[],2014-09-24 09:54:54,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"Definition
Alcohol withdrawal refers to symptoms that may occur when a person who has been drinking too much alcohol every day suddenly stops drinking alcohol.
Alternative Names
Detoxification - alcohol; Detox - alcohol
Causes
Alcohol withdrawal occurs most often in adults, but it may occur in teenagers or children.
The more you drink every day, the more likely you are to develop alcohol withdrawal symptoms when you stop drinking.
You may have more severe withdrawal symptoms if you have certain other medical problems.
Symptoms
Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually occur within 8 hours after the last drink, but can occur days later. Symptoms usually peak by 24 - 72 hours, but may persist for weeks.
Common symptoms include:
Anxiety or nervousness
or nervousness Depression
Fatigue
Irritability
Jumpiness or shakiness
Mood swings
Nightmares
Not thinking clearly
Other symptoms may include:
Clammy skin
Enlarged (dilated) pupils
Headache
Insomnia (sleeping difficulty)
Loss of appetite
Nausea and vomiting
Pallor
Rapid heart rate
Sweating
Tremor of the hands or other body parts
A severe form of alcohol withdrawal called delirium tremens can cause:
Agitation
Fever
Seeing or feeling things that arent there (hallucinations)
Seizures
Severe confusion
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may reveal:
Abnormal eye movements
Abnormal heart rhythms
Dehydration (not enough fluids in the body)
Fever
Rapid breathing
Rapid heart rate
Shaky hands
Blood and urine tests, including a toxicology screen , may be done.
Treatment
The goal of treatment includes:
Reducing withdrawal symptoms
Preventing complications of alcohol use
Therapy to get you to stop drinking (abstinence)
INPATIENT TREATMENT
People with moderate-to-severe symptoms of alcohol withdrawal may need inpatient treatment at a hospital or other facility that treats alcohol withdrawal. You will be watched closely for hallucinations and other signs of delirium tremens .
Treatment may include:
Monitoring of blood pressure, body temperature, heart rate, and blood levels of different chemicals in the body
Fluids or medications through a vein (by IV)
Sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete
OUTPATIENT TREATMENT
If you have mild-to-moderate alcohol withdrawal symptoms, you can often be treated in an outpatient setting. You will need someone to commit to staying with you during this process and who can keep an eye on you. Daily visits to your health care provider are often needed until you are stable.
Treatment usually includes:
Sedative drugs to help ease withdrawal symptoms
Blood tests
Patient and family counseling to discuss the long-term issue of alcoholism
Testing and treatment for other medical problems linked to alcohol use
It is important that the patient goes to a living situation that helps support them in staying sober. Some areas have housing options that provide a supportive environment for those trying to stay sober.
Permanent and life-long abstinence from alcohol is the best treatment for those who have gone through withdrawal.
Support Groups
The following organizations are good resources for information on alcoholism:
Alcoholics Anonymous - www.alcoholics-anonymous.org
- www.alcoholics-anonymous.org Al-Anon/Alateen - www.al-anon.org
- www.al-anon.org National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism - http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health
- http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration - www.samhsa.gov
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well a person does depends on the amount of organ damage and whether the person can stop drinking completely. Alcohol withdrawal may range from a mild and uncomfortable disorder to a serious, life-threatening condition.
Symptoms such as sleep changes, rapid changes in mood, and fatigue may last for months. People who continue to drink a lot may develop health problems such as liver, heart, and neurological disease.
Most people who go through alcohol withdrawal make a full recovery. However, death is possible, especially if delirium tremens occurs.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Alcohol withdrawal is a serious condition that may rapidly become life threatening.
Call your health care provider or go the emergency room if you think you might be in alcohol withdrawal, especially if you were using alcohol often and recently stopped. Call for an appointment with your health care provider if symptoms persist after treatment.
Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if seizures, fever, severe confusion, hallucinations, or irregular heartbeats occur.
Prevention
Reduce or avoid alcohol. If you have alcoholism, you should stop drinking completely.

Robin Williams made people laugh so hard that a writer from the LA Times claims to have almost fallen off her sofa laughing so hard. That a man of such prodigious talent should die alone in his apartment, hanging from a belt, his wrists slashed (evidently he tried cutting his wrists first and when that failed he hung himself) is an indication of how lonely and depressed he was.
Whether it was as the outrageous yet loveable Mrs Doubtfire, the brilliant and comical doctor in Patch Adams or the fumbling gay father of a heterosexual boy in Birdcage, William's will be remembered as a versatile actor who could command a smile and a tear to his audiences. However behind the silver screen like many of his contemporaries he was a depressed and lonely soul who took solace in a drug habit that may have been part of the reason behind his finally coming undone?
Insanity
Is it a failing of our society that brilliant people like Williams, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Marilyn Monroe, Michael Jackson, Amy Winehouse and Heath Ledger find themselves utterly alone and their only recourse to end the loneliness and depression lie in death? Back home it is tortured starlets like Jiya Khan and Divya Bharati, Parveen Babi, who fall prey to the depression induced suicide syndrome. Some postulate that it is living in the glare of the limelight that takes its toll; fame is a demanding mistress and with it comes the fast paced life of the rich and famous sprinkled with a generous helping of designer drugs, often a key behind the exhilarating highs and abysmal lows common for most stars.
Is the flip side to genius, temporary insanity? It is lonely at the top and stars are often not able to trust people for liking them for their 'real' off-stage personas. Intimate relationships that are closely tracked by the tabloids often get sacrificed at the altar of gossip columns and in India it is often the women who are driven to take their lives for emotional reasons while for men it is economic. While many were of the opinion that Sunanda Pushkar 'died of a broken heart' most people are aware Silk Simta in fact did die of a broken heart; that and a helping of alcohol and depression.
Why do successful, famous people commit suicide? It's hard to come up with conclusive answers, given that it is not only famous people who commit suicide. On a more personal level I remember a friend's daughter who took her life suddenly after enjoying a great summer vacation with us. She was at university and would constantly crack witty jokes becoming the life of every social gathering. She was smart and good at her studies and well-loved by many of her friends. Yet she was found hanging from her fan by her roommate.
Illness
As a student of psychology I have studied that depression is the key cause behind suicide, mostly for people who appear not to suffer from any social conditions that may lead to such depression, like extreme poverty, debt or terminal illness. These are well off, successful, good looking people who seem to really have it 'together'. However many of them are fighting depression without even knowing it.
Clinical Depression is an illness, like any other. What is worse is that more often than not it goes undetected which is why when a good looking, successful young person like a friend's daughter commits suicide it appears sudden. If we had any inkling that she was depressed we may have been able to prevent her from taking her own life. But who could have guessed behind that ebullient smile lay a depressed young girl? In fact according to a 2012 study by the World Health Organization (WHO) suicide is the third highest causes of teen deaths (number one is road traffic injuries and number two is AIDS) while depression is the main reason behind illness and disability. It is said that currently one in two people in the US are fighting depression.
Expectation
According to the report depression is the cause of numerous illnesses and disabilities which can both harm and kill teenagers. Self-harm caused by mental health issues is the third cause of death among teenagers, having taken the lives of over 120,000 teens in 2012. The report was conducted on a review of health policies from 109 countries.
In India the concern is that most people do not seek help for their depression. Those who feel troubled, depressed or anxious will think ten times before accessing any kind of help or counselling. Going to the 'shrink' is reserved for crazy people and the general impression is that if someone is feeling sad and lonely, they just need to be around friends. However we have seen a rise in India's suicide rate, statistics released by the National Crime Records Bureau indicate 1,35,445 people committed suicide in the country last year. Of this 68 per cent of these were between the age of 15 and 29 surrounded by family and friends.
So clearly not all lonely people can be cheered up by being with other people, in fact feeling lonely in a crowd is a very common emotion experienced by most people. It is the inability to speak about these emotions that often lead people to commit suicide. As a state gets developed it leads to higher rate of expectations and also a higher propensity to be depressed. Also a lack of aggression, a highly sensitive nature and a high intellectual quotient often lead people towards suicide, which is why Southern and Eastern states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Bengal are leading the suicide rate statistically.
Setting up a suicide counselling helpline often provide people with the kind of anonymity that is require for sensitive people who might also be ashamed to be seen going to a counselor or being prescribed medication for their depression. Reaching out through ad campaigns like the one recently hosted by NACO that says ""It's okay to go to a psychologist,"" need to remove the stigma that currently crops up in everyone's mind, when you mention 'therapy'. This will perhaps lead to a reduced suicide rate.

96,Hooked to the Handset,[],2014-07-18 17:02:32,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"If everyone has five vital organs, she has six: brain, heart, lungs, kidneys, liver and her mobile phone. She walks, talks, even goes to the washroom with the gadget fixed to her mouth, ears or hands. ""I'm listening,” she says, every time there's a lull in conversation because she's checking her phone or laughing at a text. If told she's on it too much, she fights with the fury of a tigress: ""It's from office.” Or she tries to do it covertly, under the table. Sometimes she looks for her phone frantically, only to realise it's in her hand. And sometimes she thinks her phone's buzzing, but there's really no call or text. Good God, her friends say, she's so boring.
You may not know but you are probably having an affair with your cell phone. It's what you wake up to and fall asleep with. You look at it 150 times a day on an average: to talk, text, mail, chat, browse Twitter or Facebook. And also to play games, watch movies, consume news, change songs, take pictures, go to apps, shop online, tell the time, plug or unplug. You read, send or check text messages 23 times in your 16 waking hours. You make, receive, miss, drop or avoid calls 22 times every day. And every time, the sound of your phone floods your brain with the same chemicals that are unleashed by the proximity of a loved one. But what if you start loving your object of desire a bit too much?
That's the latest buzz among doctors. In the midst of a mobile phone explosion, India is witnessing a rising tide of 'mobile phone addicts', people who have fallen so hopelessly in love with their handsets that it's taking a profound toll on their behaviour, health and life. Psychologists and practitioners of community medicine are trying to understand the mysterious relationship between a cell phone and its owner's ardour. A raft of studies is coming out in learned journals. And India's first clinic to treat mobile phone addiction has just come up at the country's top school for mental disorders: the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) in Bangalore.
Our mobile lover might be boring, but she is not alone: She is a face among India's 900 million mobile users-the world's second-largest, after China. And one of 15 per cent Indians who spend three hours a day to view 70 per cent internet pages via mobile. If four hours is the average time Indians spend on their phones a day (compared to 2.5 hours in the US), she uses it much more, like 68 per cent users who confess to be addicted to their phones. And like 43 per cent of them, she too would try to save her plastic love first in an emergency.
Is it really akin to drug and alcohol addiction? Or is it just casual talk, an attempt to medicalise everyday behaviour? No. Experts are dead serious about this. ""Some people find it so pleasurable to use mobile phones that they keep using it. Their behaviour harms them or others and still they can't stop, just like any other addiction,” says clinical psychologist Dr Manoj Kumar Sharma, who leads the NIMHANS centre, SHUT (Clinic Service for Healthy Use of Technology.) ""MRI scans have shown that many compulsive behaviours light up the same pleasure centres in the brain in almost the same way as drug or alcohol dependencies.” Mobile phone addiction may soon get included in the Bible for psychiatric illnesses, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Right now it is listed in the appendix for further research.
Who gets hooked? Anyone: the thrill-seeker, the depressed, the stressed-out, the lonely, who feel the urge to be connected. ""For many, it's a tool to cope with bad moods,” says Dr Ritu Nehra, clinical psychologist with PGIMER, Chandigarh. ""That's what 70 per cent of 200 undergraduate students we studied in 2012 said. Nearly 50 per cent felt 'incomplete' without it.” The addiction does not cause obvious physical problems but can lead to serious psychological issues, she explains: from anxiety, sleeplessness to neglecting studies or job to drifting away from close ties.
It was first in 2011 that Sharma started getting queries from parents and schools on the excessive use of mobile phones among teenagers. He wasn't surprised. With digitally nimble teens taking to mobile phones, what used to be the rush to the school canteen to tell everyone what's going on has become the rush to the handset to spill and share secrets. In a June 2014 study by Tata Consultancy Services, 71 per cent of 12,300 students across 12 cities called it their ""favourite gadget”. The mobile phone is a key tool that determines how they live, work and play. In May this year, a Class XII student of a Gurgaon school committed suicide after she was chided by her teacher for texting messages in class. In June 2013, a 16-year-old fell off a local train in Mumbai. She was too busy speaking on her mobile phone.
Most parents approach the NIMHANS clinic either because academic grades have started to drop or sudden behaviour changes have been detected. Typically, what begins as an hour-long daily activity-internet, gaming, social media-spirals into an obsession that consumes six to seven hours a day or more. The child tries not to go to school, avoids friends, family outings, food and sleep. Anger, aggression, irritability are seen when they are forced to part with their phones. When they start avoiding conversation and eye contact, parents come running: ""I am losing my child.” ""Children like the freedom, anonymity and innovative thrills of the virtual world,” Sharma says. ""But the line between reality and its simulations can blur dangerously.”
Scientists are busy classifying the range of phone addiction they observe: from nomophobia, the fear of having no mobile phones, to textaphrenia, or thinking that a message has arrived when it hasn't, to textiety, or panic attacks over not receiving or sending text messages. When Dr Sanjay Dixit, professor and head of community medicine at the MGM Medical College in Indore, conducted a study on 200 MBBS students in 2009, he found that nine out of 10 showed some form of phone addiction: 56 per cent kept mobile phones close to their body to be in constant touch with it, 93 per cent got panic attacks when they did not get messages, 42 per cent suffered from disturbed sleep due to excessive phone use, and 19 per cent had painful thumbs due to over-texting. ""It's truly a new evolutionary twist to the gadget Alexander Graham Bell had engineered,” he says. ""The addiction comes from your fear that something enormously important will happen while you are out of reach and that you won't be able to react,” says Dixit. Needless to say, it's an exaggerated fear.
In the privacy of the mobile phone, all kinds of behavioural addictions thrive. Sample a 35-year-old Bangalore mother's case. Two years ago, she quit her job to stay at home with her four-year-old son, as her husband had a transferable job. She felt crushed by loneliness and boredom. But she did find an emotional outlet-the games on her smartphone. She couldn't seem to stay away. Soon, she was telling herself she would do it for an hour or two at the end of the day, but she would wind up gaming all night. ""When you're in that state, you're not thinking clearly,” she says. It took her son-as he started picking up her habits-to sound the alarm. ""If he gets hooked on to the phone at this age, I don't know how I'll live with myself,” she remembers thinking. She called Sharma and went through intensive therapy. She hasn't checked a gaming site since.
Her story nods to the fact that therapy can be effective. That's a relief at a time mobile phones, with ever-expanding frills and features, burrow deeper into our lives and the sceptre of addiction stalks a talkative nation. With therapy catching up with science, doctors are detailing lists of things that can be done to combat the technology disorder. One often-suggested solution is to step away from the phone for a while and connect with nature. The other is to make sure you get a full night's sleep, apart from forbidding technology at the dinner table. The bottom line is: bring in a sense of balance and be aware. Mobile phone addiction is not fatal and by using a few simple strategies to resettle your brain you can live happily ever after even with your mobile phone."
97,Royal families: The way we were,[],2014-06-06 12:28:46,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"OH, funny, awful things I remember about my childhood,"" says the attractive dark-eyed girl in blue jeans and an FU's T-shirt. She's just come down from giving her two-year-old son a bath. Pausing to reminisce over a cup of coffee she might be any housewife taking a breather after a morning of household chores. She's not, though. And her childhood, which she says was ""magical"" and ""fairytale-like"" was also full of embarrassments that she's learnt to laugh about today. ""On my first day in school,"" she says, ""the whole school came out to be photographed with me. I was three years old. For the six years I was in the convent in Srinagar I wasn't allowed to eat with the other kids. My lunch came separately, and I ate it with a cousin in a separate little parlour. My class tests were sometimes rigged: I'd get full marks even when I'd made mistakes. Once an awful thing happened on sports day. I was made to win the one-legged race, when it was certain that another boy should have won it. Apparently he was told not to. He was so furious when I got the first prize, he picked up a clump of bicchu buti and ran after me, till I was taken howling home. Things became so bad that my parents were forced to send me to a public school.""
Chauhan: 'My class tests were sometimes rigged' Chauhan: 'My class tests were sometimes rigged'
This is Jyoti Chauhan, 26, daughter of the former maharaja of Kashmir, speaking about her years at Presentation Convent, Srinagar, from 1960 to 1966.
""SCHOOL?"" asks the portly member of Parliament, dressed in a carefully-chosen combination of sky blue and white: a white Cardin belt holding up his blue trousers, a blue silk handkerchief peeping from the breast pocket of his white jacket and an expensive Cartier watch shining on his chubby wrist. ""For me going to school was like going home. When I went to Mayo aged nine, I lived in my own three-bedroomed bungalow on the campus, with its own drawing and dining, its own kitchen and large garden. I had three cars - a French Delage and two Chevrolets - and maybe a dozen polo ponies. A retinue of about 25 servants travelled to school from Gujarat with me. The comptroller of my household was my English guardian, Brig, Howson. I wore a white achkan, churidars and safa in class and was expected to dress for dinner in a black sherwani. If I wanted to invite schoolboys to eat with me, I had to write off letters weeks in advance. There were no dormitories, no common toilets or mess room. When Mayo became a public school from being a prince's school in 1943 my parents were so worried about my discomfort, they rented a house for me outside the campus. Much to my irritation, servants would leave extra chocolates and biscuits in my room.""
Everyday existence, as a result, can get sharply schizophrenic. Princely types may assume anonymity in the cosmopolitan life of New Delhi or Bombay but, back at the palace, life is slower to catch up.
Jaideep Singh: 'Going to school was like going home' Jaideep Singh: 'Going to school was like going home' This is Jaideep Singh, 54, formerly the maharaja of Baria and now a Congress(I) MP from Gujarat talking about his years at Mayo College, Ajmer, from 1939 to 1947.
OBVIOUSLY, going to school for the maharajas will never be the same again. Even between the 1940s and 1960s things had changed - no dressing for dinner under stern English eyes for the young Kashmir princess - but what has changed in the 1980s? Everything and nothing.
Twelve years after the last of their privileges was abolished by an act of Parliament, the scions of the erstwhile Indian ruling elite are trying to get their act together. They're trying to joke about the old days, forget about the raw deal the Government gave them, and get a firm, new grip on their double lives.
Some have cracked up under the pressure of change; others remain absurd social anachronisms pursuing obsolescent cultural codes; while others have adapted their inherited privileges of power and wealth to become captains of Parliament and industry. But the duality dogs them all.
Last summer, the ailing maharaja of Jaisalmer died of a brain tumour. He was about 50. His widow, a beautiful Nepali princess, went into mourning inside the palace for a year. She was required to wear cotton saris of an indigo blue. She was expected to receive no male visitors, except the closest of relations. For a year she could not stir out of her apartment inside the sprawling fortress-palace. The maharaja had once been a politician.
Not a very active one, being prone to bouts of drinking and depression. In later years he gave up Parliament, went back to the palace in Jaisalmer, and surrounded himself with his few old retainers and courtiers. ""He never moved out of Jaisalmer,"" says a close relative, ""it was as if he had regressed into the past. He just chose to slide back into the old world and die.""
Last year, the erstwhile ruler of a prominent city in Rajasthan held his birthday durbar inside the City Palace. Not a durbar in the old style - when visiting nobles would pay homage to the ruler by drowning him in gold sovereigns - but a celebration adapted to modern times. Old remaining members of the city's nobility and their wives were invited to attend.
The women were expected to dress in mandatory chiffon saris - preferably in the colour of Oxford blue. They sat apart from the men. rigid with formality on hard-backed chairs. When ""His Highness"" entered, they bowed low in greeting, hissing endless hukams and huzoors and, the more respectful among them, rapidly downed the ends of their saris in elaborate purdah.
Waiters were carrying around trays of drinks-this was, after all, a bit of a party - and being good Rajput ladies few could decline. They were soon observed knocking back the whiskies inside their purdah. ""It was the funniest sight on earth,"" chuckled a younger Rajput who refused to resort to the double standard of sinning-unseen. ""The only problem, of course, was they couldn't light cigarettes. It would have sent their saris up in smoke.""
Old traditions die hard. Especially for a group of people, some of whom claim direct descent from the Gods, who were born to rule. Transplanted into democratic India, greatness is thrust upon them. They still control large mandates in the states they come from.
With their gilded palaces and carriages, their inherent religious and social superiority and enormous private wealth, they are figures of glamour and gossip. Back in their state they still personify the symbol of authority to the peasant. In contemporary life, they continue to represent a powerful lobby in the public eye.
Everyday existence, as a result, can get sharply schizophrenic. They may assume anonymity in the cosmopolitan life of New Delhi or Bombay but life inside the palace is slower to catch up. ""What can you do if old servants still touch your feet in Jammu?"" asks Jyoti Chauhan.
Raje: 'I could never walk down a Gwalior street alone' Raje: 'I could never walk down a Gwalior street alone'
""No. I could never walk down the street in Gwalior alone,"" says Vasundhara Raje, a Gwalior princess who married the heir of the erstwhile Dholpur family. Both girls, whose respective parents are political veterans, admit that villagers prostrating themselves before their old rulers remains a common sight on constituency tours.
Gaj Singh: 'Coming home was a double shock' Gaj Singh: 'Coming home was a double shock'
Gaj Singh, the young descendant of Jodhpur maharajas who was earlier India's high commissioner to Trinidad and Tobago, says that when ""people touch my feet or prostrate themselves in villages, it's not just a personal act; they're paying homage to a symbol, to a tradition that still lingers."" Singh is affectionately called ""Bapji"", even by his close family and friends though the nickname - literally meaning ""father"" - was coined by the people of Jodhpur for their ruler.
A dapper 36, Singh divides his time between his homes in New Delhi and Jodhpur, looking after his properties and business interests which include the Umaid Bhawan Palace Hotel now managed by a leading hotel chain. Brought up in England - he was four years old when his father died and he was invested as maharaja - he had just taken his degree at Cambridge and was returning to India overland with friends when he was hurriedly summoned home to face the abolition of privy purses.
As royal tours proliferate and palace hotels become more lavishly ritzy, some have discovered that if politics won't pay, trading their name and assets might.
""It was a double shock,"" he says, ""one of assuming responsibility and another of completely restructuring my whole life-style.""
In 1971, the transition from Cambridge to Jodhpur was painful for Singh. In 1950, Jaideep Singh had made exactly the same transition - when his grandfather died suddenly - from Cambridge to Baria to face large assets, new taxation laws, settlements of properties and staff.
""But the succession was kept alive because of privy purses and privileges."" He was not a ruling maharaja but the title and power remained. Gaj Singh of Jodhpur, 20 years later, was only ruler in name. ""And my son Shivraj, now aged seven,"" he says, ""will have no official status whatsoever.""
Still, signs of the old life linger. Gaj Singh makes it a point to be back in Jodhpur for important festivals like Holi and Diwali. On his official birthday - calculated each year according to the Hindu calendar - he has a little tea party which is announced publicly. ""Not a durbar,"" he clarifies gently, ""we just put a small advertisement in the local papers.
If any of the people want to turn up, they're welcome."" But when he has a party in Delhi invitations with the Jodhpur crest and his title are sent out. Princely types of all age-groups show up in abundance. Introductions are made according to title and rank. Some semblance of protocol is observed in greeting and conversation.
Women cover their heads with their saris discreetly. Men bow low to say khamagani - the Rajput greeting. The air is thick once again with the sound of hukam and huzoor.
THE formality remains a part of life. ""I just couldn't be on first name terms with an older Rajput,"" says Vasundhara Raje, ""it would come naturally to address them as hukam or maharaj, to sit straight up before them, to mind my p's and q's in conversation. Unless they were younger or contemporaries. I would be expected to use their title when making an introduction or even when speaking of them with a third person.
""Raje, a lively 32-year-old who lives alone with her 10-year-old son, says she feels embarrassed herself if she's introduced as the ""Maharani of Dholpur"" and normally sticks to Mrs Singh when she meets new people. Adds Jodhpur: ""I frequently check in as plain Mr Singh into hotels and frankly I don't care a hoot if I'm called maharaja or not.
But I'm proud of my link with Jodhpur and would always like that to be known. Sometimes the title is used for courtesy, and sometimes for information."" But all of them admit to titles being useful, especially abroad.
Many of them have learnt, through trial, error or plain necessity, that the aura can reap rich harvests. Some may have been driven to dipsomania trying to make it work, but the more enterprising have kept the maharaja industry multiplying. Hard sell has replaced the hard luck history of the early 1970s. Books on royal India get more numerous daily.
Princely biographies are lapped up eagerly. As royal tours proliferate and palace hotels become more lavishly ritzy, some have discovered, that if politics won't pay, trading their name and assets might.
While the bigger guns among them have taken over the most prestigious segment of the hotel industry - the Kashmir, Jaipur, Udaipur, Jodhpur, Mysore and Gwalior families al; have palace hotels - and still others like the Baroda and Gwalior princes have major interests in the textile industry, it's the smaller princes who've had to flog their treasures to survive.
This has spawned an enormously successful trade in precious jewellery and antiquities which flow into the market from seemingly bottomless troves. The more illustrious among the families have converted sections of their palaces into museums and charitable trusts that enshrine their history and heirlooms. Smaller princelings have emerged as lounge-lizard wheeler-dealers who trade on behalf of their richer cousins.
Dealing in money for the princes has been the hardest reality to accept. The commercial instinct was never particularly finely honed among ruling families - in fact it was plainly despised. ""Most of the princes had no business acumen.
When some ruling princes in my grandfather's time began to speculate on the stock exchange, he used to scorn them. Rulers were expected to be above money,"" says Jaideep Singh. Financial ineptitude has been the biggest scourge among princely families. Combined with family litigation it has abruptly ended many a noble lineage. Disaster stories abound on the princely circuit.
A few years ago, Pratap Singh, the young maharaja of Alwar, shot himself through his head. Involved in a local property dispute he simply refused to permit city officials to enter with search warrants. Rounding up the horses off his stud farm, the odd remaining elephant, and letting loose his pretty wife's pet lioness and army of Great Danes, he laid siege around the Phoolbagh Palace. For three days he held out.
When the police finally infiltrated they found the young man dead. ""He really believed in visions of ancient Rajput valour,"" says a cousin of his, ""he actually thought this was the way for a true Rajput to die than give himself up.""
More recently, a younger half-brother of the Jodhpur family, stormed out of his Jodhpur home at night brandishing a sword. Apparently under the influence of alcohol his purpose was to reclaim an old property, a rest house, that he believed was rightly his. His body was later found hacked to bits in the dark by the same sword.
Such instances, argue members of the inter-related princely network are rare. Younger members of the former feudal, and sometimes feuding families, disagree. ""We're a pretty confused, mixed-up bunch,"" says a former ruler's son, born after Independence, and brought up like a plain upper class kid, with a tough grounding in business management.
""You'll hear dozens of such stories. But they will all concern the pre-Independence generation who just couldn't face the change. Many of them went bananas or retreated like ghosts into their palaces. We are trying to retrieve lost ground, in both politics and business."" Plain non-performance in politics has also terminated many a princely ruler's career. ""Previously you could have been elected on the basis of being a princely ruler,"" says Rajmata Vijaye Raje Scindia, a Rajya Sabha MP.
""Not any more, Ruler or not, you're accountable to the people."" Adds Jaideep Singh: ""Every single prince who fought the first election won it. If they fell by the wayside later it was because they didn't know what was expected of them or they had nothing to offer to the people.""
""The fact that we're princes is immaterial now,"" says Digvijay Sinh, deputy minister for environment in Mrs Gandhi's Cabinet, ""What is important is our ability to stand up to time."" Sinh won his election from Surendranagar constituency in Gujarat which encompasses the old family state of Wankaner, on the plank of creating a new Central ministry devoted to environment and ecology.
Like other successful erstwhile princes, he's got there by turning his disadvantage into advantage. But does the royal order of old border on extinction? Princes may slowly disappear, but the concept of dynasty stays. A lovely princess from Central India with flashing eyes takes up the issue of what's in a name - for that is the heart of the matter - sharply. ""Dynasties,"" she says,""never went out of fashion in India.
The architectural follies of the maharajas were no more absurd or wasteful than the Asiad edifices. Our durbars were no more ostentatious than the Non-aligned meet. Palace intrigue in an old state was never more pernicious than New Delhi's palace politics. Why crown us, then, with all the shame and jaded glory?"" So what's changed? Everything and nothing."
98,Rajneesh Foundation: The Oregon odyssey,[],2014-06-03 13:50:12,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"Almost three years after the self-styled Bhagwan Rajneesh and his free-wheeling followers quit India, the controversies that have haunted them constantly still continue to dog their footsteps, even in the scrubby desert hills of Rajneeshpuram, Oregon.
But if Rajneesh's chief aide, Ma Anand Sheela, 33, is to be believed when she drawls: ""We love publicity - good or bad"", the Rajneesh Foundation International (RFI) shouldn't worry. Right now they are getting all the publicity they could possibly want - most of it bad.
The foundation's propensity for generating negative waves surfaced almost immediately after Rajneesh, his fleet of 27 Rolls Royces and 800 of his saffron-draped acolytes halted their travelling commune in the tiny town of Antelope (population: 100) and virtually took it over. The initial resistance was only token.
The small group of around 40 elderly and outraged Antelope citizens had little chance against the tightly-controlled and aggressively acquisitive sanyasins, as they prefer to be called. Using the commune as a base, RFI systematically bought up all the commercial property in Antelope and moved some of the sanyasins into the town - just enough to give them a voting majority.
Sheela and Rajneesh entering the immigration office with attorneys: Dogged by controversy Sheela and Rajneesh entering the immigration office with attorneys: Dogged by controversy
Their strategy was obvious. Come election time in Antelope, last November, and the sanyasins steam-rolled over the local candidates, putting five of their members on the city council while their candidate for mayor, Ma Prem Karuna, was elected virtually unopposed.
The events that marked the prelude to the elections clearly showed that the RFI was determined to stay on the top ten news charts. When they arrived at their 64,229-acre ""Rancho Rajneesh"" outside Antelope in July 1981, they professed to be merely a ""friendly farming community"".
But Sheela's claim that ""we are here to build consciousness and not a city"" was rapidly belied. Flamboyantly proclaiming their capitalism with a fleet of Rolls Royces and bumper stickers which said: ""Jesus Saves, Moses Invests and Bhagwan Spends"", a head-on collision with the sleepy, conservative Oregon community was but inevitable.
Losing Battle: The Antelopians, heavily outnumbered and outgunned, took resort to every possible legal defence to try and stem the saffron tide but it was a losing battle. Prolonged and bitter court battles ended, most of which were won by the sanyasins.
Finally a large number of the original residents packed up and left, some, like Viola Wilson, selling their property to the interlopers. Those who remain, intend to keep a safe distance. Says Mona Reynolds, former city recorder for the council: ""You have to live here to really understand what we're faced with.""
They flamboyantly proclaimed their capitalism with a fleet of Rolls Royces and bumper stickers which said: ""Jesus Saves, Moses Invests, and Bhagwan Spends.""
The face of Antelope is now painted in the saffron that is Rajneesh's hallmark and a cafe called ""Zorba The Buddha"" dominates the tiny strip of houses. Quips Reynolds: ""Everytime you look out of the window you see red."" But that also signifies the constant state of war that exists between the local community and the Godman's followers.
Says Francis Dickson: ""There is no coexisting with them, no getting along."" Lately, however, the hostility level seems to have dropped a few notches. Admits Don Smith, who stood for mayor opposite Karuna: ""They call us rednecks and naive and maybe there has been some narrow-mindedness on our part."" The result is that the battle is now confined to the odd skirmish like the one over the community church which the sanyasins, typically, want to acquire for a meditation centre.
But even so, the Antelopians still sport constant reminders that the battle is not over in the form of buttons stating: ""Keep Oregon Green"" and ""Better Dead than Red"" while signboards defiantly proclaim: ""This is Jesus Country.""
They have successfully, managed to launder their image as sex-drug cultists. They still have ""encounter groups"" and as Sheela says in reply to a question: ""Sex? Sure, we have lots of it""
But there are others who are fairly impressed with the businesslike manner in which the sanyasins have developed Rajneeshpuram despite a court battle over its validity. In May 1982. the 800-odd sanyasins unanimously voted to incorporate about 2,100 acres of the ranch as a city to be called Rajneeshpuram.
The move was promptly challenged in the court of appeals by a land-use watchdog group called ""1000 Friends of Oregon"". Says Attorney Mark Greenfield: ""We feel that Rajneeshpuram is not the place to create a new city.""
Their resistance is fuelled by fears that the arid and hilly scrub land would not have enough water to support the city's projected population of 4,000. But the major apprehension is that the RFI is building an urban empire on their land under an agricultural guise. These fears are not unfounded.
The Rajneesh Investment Corporation, which handles the RFI's myriad business dealings, owns all the land that the city stands on. If RFI loses the case filed by ""1000 Friends of Oregon"", the court could declare the city unlawful and dissolve the organisational city structure which includes a mayor, Swami Krishna Deva, and a city council.
The saffron-robed settlers are well aware that their move into Antelope has been a major public relations fiasco. But it was a calculated risk, with ulterior motives. The state of Oregon has specific zoning laws which prohibit agricultural land being used for commercial purposes.
So when the commune was set up on the largely agricultural ""Rancho Rajneesh"", there remained an urgent need to acquire an urban base for the Rajneesh Foundation's vast business enterprises.
Mark Greenfield, attorney, 1000 Friends of Oregon
Model City: The pace with which the sanyasins are rapidly developing Rajneeshpuram indicates that they are supremely confident of getting a favourable judgement. Mayor Deva has presented a comprehensive 20-year plan to the Land Conservation and Development Department (LC&D) which envisions a model self-sufficient community growing in harmony with the environment.
Whether that will actually materialise remains to be seen but it is impossible to dispute the amazing achievements of the 800-odd sanyasins till now. They have turned the over-grazed low-grade ranch slopes into a flourishing farm and in the process won over local businessmen and county officials. Says Bob Rindy of the LC&D: ""It is impressive how quickly and well a group of people can build.""
In 18 months, the sanyasins have blasted roads out of rock, built a lake and dam in a desert, planted exotic trees, set up solar greenhouses and a dairy, constructed prefabricated houses and installed communication systems and utilities. Says Ma Prem Sunshine, the commune's spokeswoman: ""One must have an intense passion to build a community before one can live here.""
That passion is reflected in the cheerful commitment that the work groups display during their 12-hours-a-day seven days a week labour of love, living in groups in makeshift trailer homes, eating at a common dining hall and doubling up as cooks, construction engineers or accountants without any hierarchical hassles.
Ma Prem Sunshine, Spokeswoman for the commune
Predictably, outsiders and Antelope residents hint darkly at a core group that orchestrates the activity from the shadows. Sheela, as ranch mother and RFI president is undoubtedly the boss but apart from that the informal laid-back atmosphere makes it difficult to identify any type of hierarchichal structure.
Says Don Smith: ""The majority of them you never get to see unless they are pulled out for a demonstration."" They have also successfully managed to launder their image as sex-drug cultists. They still have ""encounter groups"" and as Sheela says in reply to a question: ""Sex? Sure, we have lots of it,"" but adding that the sheer physical involvement in building the ranch leaves little time or energy for much else.
Drugs are taboo on the ranch and alcohol intake is limited. Up front they appear to be a healthy and intelligent lot, a majority of them Americans and Europeans from obviously affluent backgrounds.
Indian Followers: Despite its deep-rooted Indian connection, there are only about 15 Indians currently on the ranch. One of them is Divyagandha who arrived recently from India to join her American sanyasin husband. She says that the ranch reminds her of Mount Abu and she is perfectly happy with her mundane job in the video library and canteen.
""I cannot express in words what Bhagwan has done for me,"" she says simply. Most of Rajneesh's Indian disciples are still at the Pune ashram which is still in operation, though the controversies and curiosity value has departed with the foreigners. Those who can afford to, fly out to Oregon for the yearly Guru Purnima festival celebrated each July at the ranch.
But inevitably, Rancho Rajneesh is no different from the Pune ashram as far as local hostility and suspicion is concerned, and it is not just confined to Antelope. Says Joan Precora, who works at a car rental agency in Portland: ""You don't wear orange or red in Oregon. People immediately think you are a Rajneeshite.""

Attorney Mark Faust, host of a popular local TV talk show feels that most Oregonians are convinced that they are weirdos. ""People are frightened by the strangeness of their religion,"" he remarks. The waves have even reached as far as the US Senate. The Rajneeshpuram newspaperrecently printed a letter written by US Senator from Oregon, Mark Hatfield to Sol West, a California millionaire and a known Republican contributor.
In the letter, Hatfield cites suggestions ""about what local jurisdiction can do to slow and stop the financial enterprises of such cults"". Such revelations have only strengthened the Rajneeshees claim that they are being subjected to religious discrimination which they compare to ""McCarthyism"".
In a recent statement, they claimed that they have been ""unjustly and unfairly branded as a dangerous cult by bigoted and fearful politicians in Washington and are now suffering because of it"".
Rapid Expansion: Suspicions regarding the group's activities have focussed on the rapid economic expansion undertaken by them. Having invested $40 million (Rs 40 crore) on the ranch last year, the group is now setting up several business enterprises. Rajneesh Investment Corporation (capital assets valued at $30 million or Rs 30 crore) a wholly-owned subsidiary of the RFI, has recently purchased a hotel, a nightclub and a bakery in Portland.
All this has put the RFI under close official scrutiny. Says Ma Prem Isabel: ""We are under a big magnifying glass. The INS (Immigration and Naturalisation Service) and the Internal Revenue Service are looking at us with much more care."" Economic expansion is not the only issue worrying Oregonians, but political expansion as well.
Many Oregonians are firmly convinced that the group's intentions are to gradually take over the entire state. Says State Representative Ted Calouri: ""There is a lot of concern about their perceived tactics - taking over a city and political system, showing that by spending money one can do what one wants to ....""
Mike Mc Craden, state representative
Mark Faust, host of local TV show
And the Rajneeshees are showing every intention of doing just that. Already they have made political forays outside Antelope and are trying for seats on the council of a city called, ironically enough. Madras. Says Rick Allen, a gas station owner in Madras who does good business with the group: ""They are a friendly lot but I cannot understand why they want a seat on the city council.""
The Rajneeshees are evidently expanding their political influence with at least one objective in mind - to try and stave off the prospect of Rajneesh being deported from America under immigration rules (see box). Meanwhile, they are rapidly increasing their numbers (Sheela claims they receive between 30 and 50 applications a day).
So far, the Rajneeshees have displayed considerable spunk and staying power in fighting the odds against them and there are definite signs that they are now being treated with far more respect and sympathy than when they first arrived. Says State Representative Mike McCraden: ""The commune's inter-government is creative and well within the law. They are exercising their constitutional rights.""
And more and more people are coming round to Faust's view that: ""As far as I'm concerned, if they have a city and it's legal and they practise their religion, so what? That's America.""
IMMIGRATION: STAYING POWER

IN addition to the many controversies generated by the Rajneeshees, they are now faced by the threat of deportation that hangs over theof their religion, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh.
Last fortnight, Owen Panner, a US district judge, dismissed the Acharya's complaint seeking intervention against the US Government's efforts to deport him. The judge ruled that court intervention at this stage would be premature as no administrative decision has yet been taken.
The fracas dates back to December 11, 1982, when the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (INS) denied two petitions from the Bhagwan's attorneys, one for a visa in the religious worker category, the other for an adjustment of his visa status from visitor to immigrant. Bhagwan's attorneys appealed the decisions, claiming that no reasons were given for their denial.
The INS, admitting a 'procedural error', reopened the cases and allowed the attorneys to file a rebuttal. Fearing, however, that matters might still be taken out of their hands, Bhagwan's lawyer, Swami Prem Niren, filed an action in the federal district court, claiming that the officials of the INS had acted ""illegally and unconstitutionally"". The federal court has still to decide whether it has jurisdiction over a case in which the INS has yet to take a decision. Meanwhile, further action by the INS has been stayed and the deportation halted.
Unpopular: The case received wide publicity and has since taken on emotional overtones, especially in Oregon. If public sentiment was the only judge, the silent guru would already have been out of the country. As it is, the INS is walking the tightrope between accusations of according special privileges to Rajneesh, and religious discrimination against him.
Says Niren: ""We do demand that Bhagwan be given his rights and that decisions be made on whatever criteria the law provides, not based on personal attitudes of the people who make those decisions.""
To him, some of the INS explanations make little or no sense. On the one hand, they claim that Bhagwan lied about his health when he obtained a tourist visa for medical treatment in this country in June 1981; on the other, they say he is too ill to work. Again, they say that he does not qualify as a religious leader because of his self-imposed silence - a silence that has now lasted two years.
Niren: Spirited defence Niren: Spirited defence
Concludes Niren in cautious legalese: ""It is true that the system is geared towards traditional and established western religion. If Jesus had come in when he was alive, with his little band of fishermen, he might have had a hard time satisfying the INS requirements.""
Can the INS define what behaviour characterises a spiritual leader? It can hardly be denied that Rajneesh has inspired many, however unusual it may be. Mark Faust, believes that ""the INS may be influenced a little by public opinion"". But the sanyasins think it is more than that. Sheela, the only official spokeswoman for the Bhagwan, flung accusations at US Senator Mark Hatfield, and other politicians.
The Rajneesh Times, Rajneeshpuram's weekly newspaper, carried a photocopy of a letter written by the senator to a Republican fund-raiser showing concern over Rajneeshee activities. The senator had said that the INS is ""pursuing carefully an investigation of irregularities"".
Adverse Reaction: Meanwhile Don Smith, a former Antelope resident openly admitted working with the INS and hopes for Bhagwan's deportation. Local newspapers have carried anonymous letters that urge a write-in campaign for the denial of his visa. The Jewish Federation Council and Board of Rabbis in California have urged the INS to deny a petition of permanent residency status to the leader of a ""cult with a history of antisemitism"".
As for the INS, its officials are not convinced that Bhagwan came to the US strictly for medical treatment. Sheela retorts: ""The man had been told that he had but a few months to live."" Rajneesh's illnesses are listed as severe allergies, Juvenile diabetes, and an intervertebral disc.
Dismissing rumours about his sudden departure from India, she ruled out the INS notion that Bhagwan had intended to emigrate: ""He is such a spontaneous person, he could not take such a decision so far ahead of time."" According to her, the only things that convinced him to seek residency were ""the tears in my eyes and the love from his disciples"".
The INS is, however, sceptical. Their statement provided to the attorneys, says: ""In conclusion, it must be determined that at the time the applicant received his visitor's visa from the American consul, he had the preconceived intent to seek permanent residence upon his arrival in the United States.""
The Rajneeshees have not been able to explain why so much money and preparation went into Rancho Rajneesh prior to Rajneesh's arrival and why some sanyasins had left India before he did.
The INS will dwell on this question, but till then, every avenue open to the attorneys is being exploited. In a show of unified strength, Rajneesh organisations worldwide, mobilised their members to demonstrate peacefully against the INS.
Mystique: How is the Acharya himself affected by the uncertainty of his future? Says Sheela: ""At this point it makes no difference to him at all."" There is no way of penetrating the mystique built around the man but Niren mentioned that in his interview with INS officials, the Bhagwan broke his vow of silence to say that he had no desire to remain here other than to be with the sanyasins who have asked him to stay on.
The sanyasins do not, however, see much of their master. Bhagwan lives in a beautifully landscaped house, which has been provided with an indoor swimming pool. His mother, Ma Saraswati Jain, lives nearby. Also in the US for medical treatment, she too has an appeal pending with the INS for permanent residency.
According to Sheela, Bhagwan has a leisurely routine, driving, sitting or swimming for a few hours, besides conversing with her for some time. ""In these sessions,"" she says, ""he discusses the problems of meditation and growth of his disciples. He is least interested in business."" Yet he is often present to inaugurate a new road or a power station on the ranch. ""He is proud that his disciples are so creative,"" says Sheela.
Elusive Pressure: The disciples claim to be ever grateful for Bhagwan's presence among them. The only time they see him, however, is when he drives out each afternoon in one of the 27 Rolls Royces provided by them. They leave their work aside and line up along the dusty roads, a blazing red trail of silent devotees with folded hands and serene faces.
The older residents of Antelope and other locals catching an occasional glimpse of him in his fancy cars hope that the eccentric foreigner will soon be gone, along with his sanyasins. Says Don Smith: ""I think that once Rajneesh goes, the ranch will deteriorate.""
This is wishful thinking indeed. With over $40 million (Rs 40 crore) invested in Rancho Rajneesh, its residents are not going to leave, whatever be the outcome of the immigration case. Ever practical, Ma Prem Sunshine, spokeswoman for the commune, said: ""If he left or died, it would not effect whether we live in Oregon or not. It is beautiful, though, for Bhagwan to see people manifesting his vision of life. Jesus was not so lucky."""
99,Kashmiri students harassed in Noida hostel,[],2014-05-06 07:22:28,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"Students from Jammu and Kashmir continue to be hauled up over the question of patriotism. It happened in a university in Meerut some two months back and then in Noida soon after when students from the Valley were suspended for rooting for Pakistan while watching a cricket match on television. In Meerut, a case of sedition too was briefly slapped on the students before it was revoked under pressure.
Despite the outrage then, little seemed to have changed on the ground! So, on Saturday night, some Kashmiri students of Noida International University (NIU) were allegedly forced to chant anti-Pakistan slogans by a group of drunken students.
The incident took place at a private hostel in Noida. Now NIU has moved over 100 Kashmiri students staying in the hostel, including those who were harassed on Saturday night, to a safe house - another private hostel in the same area. Following the incident, an enraged Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah sent the J&K Resident Commissioner in Delhi to NIU to meet the victims and ascertain the facts.
The Commissioner, Lokesh Kumar Jha, interacted with Kashmiri students on Monday. A university official said that Jha along with two other Kashmiri officials held an hour-long meeting with the students. ""He asked the students about their concerns and assured them that action will be taken as per law. He also gave his number to the students so that they can call him in case of emergency,"" Yogesh Rawat, NIU administration chief, said.
The incident happened in the early hours of Saturday when a group of students from another university, who were all drunk, barged into the room of a Kashmiri. The Kashmiri students alleged that the other group came with knife and rods and forced them to shout anti-Pakistan slogans. When they refused, they were allegedly called terrorists. ""Around 2.30 am I heard someone banging on my door. When I opened the door, they barged inside and asked me if I was a Kashmiri. They asked me and my two roommates to shout 'Hindustan zindabad', which we did.
They then asked us to shout 'Pakistan murdabad', but we refused. Why should we chant slogans against any country? They called us terrorists for this. Is it written on my head that I am a terrorist?"" one of the victims said, requesting anonymity. Hearing the commotion, other students gathered around the room and the matter was put to rest till the morning. In the morning students from Jammu and Kashmir, who alleged they have been facing such discrimination for months, requested the hostel warden to expel the accused students.
The request was reportedly turned down but the accused were made to apologise to the Kashmiris. Later, the Kashmiri students requested the NIU authorities to move them to another hostel. ""We did not feel safe there as the warden was clearly taking the other side. Alcohol is not allowed inside the hostel still the students were able to bring it inside. No action was taken against the accused,"" another Kashmiri student said."

101,Sri Lankan refugees: The Swiss dilemma,[],2014-04-17 13:25:45,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"Tamil signboard outside Casa Wyler Tamil signboard outside Casa Wyler
Their itinerary - Colombo, Moscow, East Berlin, West Berlin, Stuttgart, Zurich, Berne. Their final destination - Predigergasse 5 in Berne, the police office which deals with foreigners. Their aim political asylum in Switzerland.
They speak neither German nor English and the officials in Berne do not speak Tamil, but the hundreds of Sri Lankan Tamils who are arriving in the city every week have managed to convey their message fairly clearly - they want to live in Switzerland with refugee status.
""They come into this office and say 'political problems' and we don't have a choice but to believe them. It has become a major problem for us because we don't know what to do with them,"" said Pierre Alleman, chief, office of foreign police. ""Until recently, Berne had less than 100 asylum-seekers per year - now we have more than that number every month,"" he added.
No one seems to quite know what to do with them and the dramatic increase in their numbers following the July 1983 ethnic violence in Sri Lanka has sparked off a national debate in Switzerland. Fritz Hoffman, member of Parliament representing the state of Berne, said: ""Ten thousand Tamils are on their way to Berne."" While it is difficult to determine the exact number, officials put it at a few thousands with many more on the way. The police office has so far accepted 1,500 petitions for asylum, but the line outside their office is growing every day.
Most of the Tamil refugees are young men between the ages of 17 and 25. The police have knowledge of only one woman though there are a few families too. They arrive in Berne with no money, little luggage and a lot of courage, having crossed all international borders illegally.
They hide in bathrooms or under seats in international trains or sometimes just walk into Switzerland at some deserted stretch. Once in Berne they demand asylum and are guaranteed food and shelter. Most of them spend long hours idling at the railway station and receiving other refugees who come in. ""From East Berlin they cross over to West Berlin on a 24-hour visa and disappear only to surface in Berne. The international trains make very brief stops and often the police don't have time to run a thorough check - besides, they are not used to looking under seats,"" said Marco Albisetti, chief of police, Berne. ""But what is interesting is that these refugees know exactly where to enter Switzerland - they don't come through airports or other places where they would be easily detected,"" he added.
Refugees dine at the Casa: Uncertain future Refugees dine at the Casa: Uncertain future
In his statement Hoffman mentioned clandestine travel agencies in Colombo which were involved in sending these young men to Switzerland. ""Many of them arrive by car as there is someone in Brussels who drives them here for $200 (Rs 2,000),"" Alleman said.
When asked how they were so adept at crossing frontiers undetected, Sivasamba Muthulingam said: ""We have no other choice but to do it this way. In fact, all of us have bribed customs officials in Colombo so that they would allow us to leave the country."" Muthulingam, like the others, paid 10,000 Sri Lankan rupees for the air ticket.
A shopkeeper in Colombo, Muthulingam fled when his shop was ransacked and burnt. He considered going to Madras but decided to come to Berne instead. ""The Indian Government is not really bothered about what happens to us,"" he said.
Like all the other refugees, Muthulingam refused to be photographed and was wary about talking to journalists, especially Indian. Unlike the others who live in groups, he lives by himself in a rented room. He came to Berne hoping to get help from organisations like the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
""Four bus-loads of us went to the UNHCR in Geneva with our petition but we were turned away from the gates,"" Muthulingam said. Officials at the Geneva-based UNHCR, however, have no knowledge of this visit. ""We do not have a position on the mass legitimacy of their demands for asylum. The cases have to be examined on an individual basis,"" said Michel Barton, an official at the UNHCR.
He claims the UNHCR has advised all governments that it is unsafe for Sri Lankan refugees to be sent back, but the question of granting asylum had to be decided by the individual government. ""At this point we are watching the situation in Berne and if there is a need to intervene, we will do so. If it turns out that they are just economic migrants looking for jobs, then it is none of our business,"" Barton said.
View of the Berne barracks View of the Berne barracks
Not all of them, however, are economic migrants. K. Gururaja was a member of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF). He was hounded, arrested and tortured brutally, released for a brief period before being arrested and tortured again. The second ordeal lasted 14 days, after which he was set free. He spent four months in hiding before disguising himself and reaching Colombo from where he left for Moscow.
He arrived in Berne in January 1984. ""I have no news of my wife or children but I heard that they were being interrogated often. I would like to bring them here,"" he said. Gururaja, unlike many of the others, is willing to go wherever he is sent, but cannot return to Sri Lanka. He lives with 40 other refugees at Casa Wyler, a barrack-like construction which is home for these men till something is decided. Like other Sri Lankan Tamils, Gururaja came to Switzerland because it had many international organisations.
The ICRC has not involved itself in the present situation. ""We met some of them in Geneva but they cannot do much because the question of asylum has to be decided by the Swiss Government,"" police chief Albisetti said. The ICRC, however, did visit Sri Lanka in 1983. ""When the trouble broke out last year, we visited Sri Lanka and made an offer of our services, namely to ensure the safety of prisoners and political detainees, but the offer was turned down by the Government and we had to leave Sri Lanka,"" said Pascal Gondrand, an official at the ICRC.
The question of granting political asylum has to be decided by the Federal Council - Switzerland's highest executive body - which already has 16,000 pending applications. For its part, the city of Berne has mobilised all available resources to accommodate the refugees. But recently, citizens voted against a proposal to requisition an old hotel to house refugees .
This might make it difficult for officials to accommodate them. Meanwhile, however, they have been spread all over the city and are in groups of 40 to a camp, and four to a room. They are provided with beds and a cupboard each and the refugees bring the rest - usually cassettes with Tamil film music. The 28 Swiss francs (Rs 140) they receive per day allows them to buy a tape-recorder, among other things.

""We are doing our best for them and we wish they would cooperate. They hang around all the time at the station attracting attention and racial tension is growing - the citizens of Berne are paying for these people,"" Albisetti said. Recently the Sri Lankans were involved in a fight with a group of Pakistanis in the station and that has not helped the situation.
The refugees have their own reasons for spending all their time in the station. They enjoy the anonymity. ""On the very first day of the violence in Sri Lanka, my shop was burnt and I was hit on the head. I have been on the run for a long time and I came here in December 1983. I find the station a very secure place,"" said P. Shankaradasan.
However, it is clear that the refugees are not helping themselves. They are often not very honest with the police, thus endangering their cause. ""Some of them told us they arrived directly from Sri Lanka when we know for a fact that they had spent some years in Germany and France,"" Alleman said.
The Swiss police have now established contacts with their counterparts in Germany and France to weed out false claimants. ""We know for a fact that there are more than 10,000 Sri Lankan refugees around France and Germany and they are now making their way to Berne because they think it's easier to get asylum in Switzerland,"" Albisetti said.
The police is unable to tone up the patrolling of frontiers because it is understaffed and there is a federal order banning new recruits. The Swiss mission in Sri Lanka has been alerted to look for clandestine travel agencies. ""We are almost sure they exist because all the refugees say the same things - they all tell us they came from Milan in two hours when the journey takes much longer by train,"" Alleman said.
There is also mounting tension within the young men in the various camps. Apparently the various political factions among the Tamils is faithfully represented in the camps and there have been some very violent fights. ""And all of them have to deal with racism,"" said Emanuel Nedi, one of the caretakers at Casa Wyler.
To top it all, alcoholism is growing among the refugees. The police cannot ask the Sri Lankan embassy for any help because in the asylum rules there is a clause which prohibits any contact with the country from which the people are fleeing. A high-level meeting was held in late March to discuss the situation. One of the recommendations was to increase the patrolling of frontiers. Until now none of the demands of the refugees has been accepted, and judging from the present mood, the future does not look very promising."

Abdul Rehman Antulay, former Maharashtra chief minister, arraigned for over three years for alleged corruption and other criminal offences, will most probably hear the judicial pronouncement on him lying in bed in his cabin on the tenth floor of Bombay Hospital.
He suffered a cardiac arrest on January 8. and was rushed to the intensive care unit where he lay for 25 days. A week before that, he and his fledgling Bharatiya Congress, comprising rebels from the Congress(I), were badly mauled in the Lok Sabha polls.
And now, as his trial enters the closing chapters in the court of Justice Dinshaw Merita at room No. 13 on the ground floor of the greystone Bombay High Court building, there are all signs of the one-time 'sultan' of Bombay running up against a solid and impregnable wall.
Justice Mehta will pronounce his judgement this fortnight on a complaint filed by Ramdas Nayak, a leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which said that the former chief minister had indulged in cheating, bribery, extortion and corruption during his term in office between June 1980 and January 1982.
The crux of the complaint is that Antulay had passed off his five personal trusts as government trusts and then collected donations for them from the public in consideration of distributing official largesses, such as cement, enhanced quota of industrial alcohol, and permissions to build and transact in real estate.
An adverse judgement could mean fines and a maximum punishment of up to seven years imprisonment, though the road of appeal to the Supreme Court would still be open to both the parties.

Ram Jethmalani
As a senior counsel of the high court said: ""We've come close to a turning point in judicial history. No matter what the judge finally says, it'll be the first pronouncement by the judiciary on the honesty of a public servant following a complaint made not by the state but by a member of the public.""
Though Nayak is the main complainant in the case, it is his senior counsel. Ram Jethmalani, a former MP of the BJP and the country's ace criminal lawyer. who has stolen the show as Antulays' star adversary.
Jethmalani dug his teeth into the case as early as September 1981 - shortly after the media disclosures of Antulay's trust scandals - when he took up Nayak's brief on the criminal complaint simultaneously with the civil suit filed by Mrinal Gore, P.B. Sawant and others.
While Ashok Desai, another luminary of the Bombay bar, who was the counsel for Gore, was finally able to argue the case successfully, leading to Justice Lentin pronouncing that there was indeed a 'nexus' between the donations and the largesses, Jethmalani plodded along a more circuitous way to put Antulay in the dock for trial in the criminal case.
Jethmalani, and his suave, Oxford-educated son, Mahesh, have for the past few months slogged 14 hours a day on the case, returning all other briefs in dozens. Stacks of the files and papers related to the Antulay case have piled up on virtually every square-inch of available space in their Nariman Point office.
Though they have argued the case entirely free of cost, so high has been the public interest in it that donations amounting to nearly Rs 75,000 have come along to Nayak to meet the incidental expenses, often from anonymous contributors and in denominations as small as five rupees. Said an exhausted but unfazed Jethmalani: ""I've given my life's best in this case. I sink or swim with it.""
Antulay. on the other hand, had mostly reverses coming his way. His worries are hidden adroitly behind a screen of bluster. ""By God's grace, I shall win the case and prove that I'm the cleanest politician to take on Mr Clean,"" he says, archly referring to Rajiv Gandhi with his customary self-righteousness. But the die is clearly cast against him.
""There is very little hope left for Antulay really. All his braggadocio and rhetoric come from an illusion of power to which politicians often fall victim...""
Ashok Desai eminent lawyer
And Jethmalani feels he is getting closer to his quarry whom he has stalked all these years. He first ripped through Antulay's defence in 1982 when the Supreme Court upheld a high court judgement that the Maharashtra governor could sanction Antulay's trial without consulting the state cabinet, many of whose members were Antulay's cronies.
Thereafter. Antulay's second line of defence also came down crumbling: it was that being an MLA, he was a public servant, and therefore he could be tried only with the sanction of his 'appointing authority', the speaker of the Assembly.
The Supreme Court bluntly stated that an MLA was no public servant. Thus Antulay was up for trial by a special judge of Bombay High Court, on criminal charges, like any other ordinary accused.
Though the trial still has a long way to go - even if the charges are ordered to be framed, Antulay will have a right to cross-examine the witnesses all over again - the case has altered his quick. electric personality.
He now needs the support of a wall to shuffle up to the telephone, barely a few yards away from his bed. A connoisseur of sumptuous biryanis, he eats two frugal meals a day. There is a reiterative reference to 'God's court', as if the court on this side has already delivered its judgement. And, bereft of an inner will to battle on, his familiar smile, often found sinister by many, looks pathetically vacuous now.
The case, numbered Special Case 24 of 1982, was transferred for trial from the Supreme Court last year by the order of a five-judge bench. Since April last year, it has been heard for well over 80 days, involving 53 witnesses, and has hogged media space like no other case in recent times.
The essence of the complaint is that Antulay is guilty of having conceived a scheme of aggrandisement involving obtaining of funds from the public and then putting the funds substantially under his control. In the process, he is alleged to have committed offences of:
cheating, under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for having 'dishonestly induced' builders, sugar cooperatives capable of manufacturing industrial and potable alcohol, and property owners in making large contributions to the trusts;
extortion, under Section 384 of IPC, for having intentionally put the makers of alcohol in fear of losing business by imposing cuts on their licensed quota in order to secure donations from them:
bribery, under Section 161 and 165 of IPC, for having accepted illegal gratification by way of the donations in spite of being a public servant: and
corruption, being a public servant, as defined in Section 5 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.
The first major break in the ding-dong legal battle, however, came in the civil case when Justice Lentin of the Bombay High Court stayed the operation of the trusts' accounts in January 1982 and held that there was a quid pro quo involved in the donations made to them and favours shown to the donors. Antulay, who was at a meeting when the judgement came, drove straight to his residence, called a press conference, and announced his decision to resign.
But he was still able to block criminal proceedings on the ground that no chief minister could be tried without the governor's sanction for offences allegedly committed during his tenure in office. It took jethmalani six months. and two appeals, to get an order out of Supreme Court that the governor could indeed sanction such trial on his own, without consulting the cabinet, that is. The judgement came on July 27, 1982, and the Governor, I.H. Latif, gave his sanction the next day.
But Antulay's trial before a special judge again got interrupted by a shrewd defence argument that the assembly speaker's sanction was also necessary. After the Supreme Court also waved it aside, Justice S.N. Khatri was appointed trial judge and the trial began in right earnest in April 1984. In August. Justice Khatri resigned voluntarily following some charges levelled at him by the prosecution. and Justice Mehta stepped in.
The striking feature of the trial is that it combines the hearings with an ongoing investigation. Antulay had indeed been indicted by the press through a series of investigative reports long before the case went to court.
But the press focussed on circumstantial evidence which strongly, but obviously not conclusively. suggested that there was a link between the donations received by Antulay for the trusts and the favours shown to the donors by his government.
The thesis had to be proved in court, and what the prosecution needed were nuggets of solid documentary facts, which they could come by only if the state machinery did not stand in the way.
Ironically, the case reached its final crescendo soon after Mrs Gandhi's death on October 31 last year, when a number of state government officials, as though reassured by the fact that there would be no retribution for them if they came up with evidence, began coming forward as witnesses for the prosecution, providing crucial testimony, explaining various anomalies in the documents already placed before the court, and throwing new light on the bizarre working of the state Government under the controversial chief minister.
The most prominent among these witnesses were V.T. Chari and Vijay Singh. former secretaries in the department of food and civil supplies: L.S. Lulla, a former Maharashtra chief secretary who had officiated as officer-on-special duty (OSD) in Antulay's secretariat; additional chief secretary B.K. Halwe; D.V. Ekbote, a superintendent in the food and civil supplies department. Except Lulla, all of them are in government service now and it is the opinion of lawyers - without meaning any prejudice to the integrity of the witnesses - that the officials would have been ""inhibited"" had Vasantdada Patil. the Maharashtra chief minister and Antulay's staunch foe in the field of politics, not taken such a tough stand with regard to him.
""Who am I to encourage or discourage court witnesses?"" Patil asked India Today. But the officials in his government, one and all, sang in unison against Antulay at the court, levelling charges such as:
the written recommendations of Antulay for release of cement to builders who had donated money to his trusts were not recommendations but ""orders to be given effect to"";
Pesi D. Tata, Antulay's friend who died in 1982, was actually the link between him and the businessmen who benefited from ad hoc allotments of cement and alcohol quota;
that Antulay attempted to substitute official notes containing references to Pesi Tata by other notes, ""less embarrassing to the Government"", but also carrying his signature: and, that he indulged in overwriting on government files as the hearing on the earlier civil case began in September 1981, while he was still in office.
Also revealing are the depositions of builders, shopowners, manufacturers of industrial and potable alcohol and other private citizens who pointed accusing fingers at Antulay. Examples:
Rajan and Deepak Raheja of Rajdeep Raheja Constructions said Pesi Tata had approached them with the offer of cement against a donation of Rs 40 per bag to the trusts;
Mahesh Sadarangani of the K. Raheja group said that his company got 1,654 metric tonnes of cement after donating Rs 8,82,000 to KonkanUnnati Mitra Mandal, one of the trusts floated by Antulay;
Lalchand Rohra, Mukesh Dadiani and Ramesh Merchant of Nanubhai testified that they had donated Rs 8 lakh to the Indira Gandhi Pratibha Pratisthan (IGPP) in exchange for a no objection certificate (NOC) from Antulay to sub-let its premises to the Indo-Suez Bank at a rent of Rs 1.2 lakh per month. Merchant, who had once been Antulay's tailor, deposed that he negotiated the price with Antulay himself at Varsha, the chief minister's official residence in the Malabar Hills area, where Antulay demanded Rs 10 lakh but it was bargained down to Rs 8 lakh; and
Anilkumar S. Ruia, joint managing director of Kolhapur Sugar Mills, disclosed that his three companies paid Rs 4.25 lakh as donation to the Konkan Unnati Mitra Mandal in consideration of restoring cuts in their allotment of industrial alcohol, the figure being arrived at on the basis of ""25 paise per bulk litre"".
As against the impressive list of witnesses coming forward to depose against Antulay. those whose testimonies are regarded by the prosecution as ""hostile"" are very few: only Ajit Kerkar, managing director of India Hotel Company which owns the Taj group, and two builders, Niranjan Hiranandani and Mahendra Gala.
Both Hiranandani and Gala, who had obtained cement from Antulay's ad hoc quota and had also donated to his trusts, said the two had no interrelation, which negates the crux of the prosecution argument.
And Kerkar, who was himself a trustee on the IGPP, in addition to denying the suggestion of any quid pro quo, said that the Taj group had deposited Rs 1 crore with the Sethia Foundation Trust, yet another of Antulay's creations, not for any permission to build another Taj hotel on the premises of the National Council of Performing Arts (NCPA) at the prestigious Nariman Point but to ensure that the Taj employees, many of whom came from the Konkan area where the Sethia Trust proposed to set up a hospital, got medical facilities.
Antulay's two young counsels. Nitin Pradhan and Vidyasagar Kanade, exuding the never-say-die spirit, think there are yet some ""bright silver linings"" on the dark clouds created over the case by ""adverse media reportings on the trial"". According to Pradhan, the versions put out by Kerkar and the two other builders corroborate the defence contention that there was indeed no ""nexus"" between the donations and the official favours. He also thinks it involves stretching the Evidence Act ""a bit too far"" to prosecute his client largely on the basis of words and deeds of Tata, ""a man dead and gone long ago"".
But Mahesh Jethmalani thinks he and his father have an ""air-tight case"". Says Ashok Desai: ""There is very little hope left for Antulay really. All hisbrag-gadocio and rhetoric come from an illusion of power to which politicians often fall victim. It is ironic that even Antulay. who has a background in law, left his hoof marks all over on the files while taking decisions for which he was fit to be hauled over coals."" Desai should know, because he and Antulay did their bar-at-law in London together.
The present trial of Antulay defies all set categorisation because it is indeed difficult to say where prosecution begins and investigation ends. But, as the hearings end this fortnight, the judge may either dismiss the complaint, thus giving Antulay a clean chit, or ask the charges to be framed, which means admission of a prima facie case against him. That will leave Antulay with another opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses, and prove his innocence. But an order to frame the charges, if given, is a development serious enough because it will definitely amount to adverse judicial pronouncement on the former chief minister in a criminal case.
Though the court holds the key to Antulay's survival, it is by sheer force of habit that he is seeking election again in the assembly election from the Sriwardhan constituency in coastal Maharashtra. He may win simply because he led his nearest rival in the assembly segment by nearly 18,000 votes in the Lok Sabha elections. But full five fathoms deep lie his chances of getting immunity from law again as an mla in view of the earlier Supreme Court judgement.
Nor is there any hope that the Congress) I (leadership will extend its protective wing to him. Said Vasantdada Patil: ""I really don't know by what accident this Antulay became the chief minister of Maharashtra. His chief ministership was a disgraceful chapter anyway.""
Still, more than merely deciding the fate of Antulay, the clawing legal battle has derived its uniqueness from its unparalleled feature of combining trial with investigation. Witnesses have been called out not only to corroborate charges but to disclose new facts and unleash new evidence against the accused.
""What can I do."" asks Jethmalani, ""when the law does not permit me to seize documents firsthand and to get at the concrete facts?"" The trial has also redefined the level of public servants' immunity against law, and has broadened the scope and meaning of the word 'corruption' to include in its sweep even professedly altruistic exercises.
But, above all, and irrespective of Justice Mehta's final word on the case, it has shown the extent to which the court can go on doggedly pursuing a complaint when all other institutions of democracy seemed to have got stymied with fear and suspicion and the people had begun entertaining doubts about the fairness of the executive. The implications of the case have at last far surpassed Antulay, the man."
103,Mystery around Sunanda death not laid to rest yet,[],2014-02-25 14:16:19,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201402/sunanda-1-2_650_022514015611_0.jpg,"Sunanda Pushkar Sunanda Pushkar
The death of Union minister Shashi Tharoor's wife Sunanda Pushkar is still shrouded in mystery with the investigators still probing whether it was a case of murder or suicide. Though the police said they haven't yet ruled out the murder angle, they said none of Sunanda's family members have come forward with any complaints against Tharoor.
""She consumed poison/medicines or was injected poison or was forcefully given some medicines is still a matter of probe,"" said a Delhi Police top officer. The officer added that they can't say anything concrete as to how she was poisoned as they are still waiting for the forensic and viscera reports.
Delhi Police Commissioner B.S. Bassi said the police were carrying out necessary inquiries. ""The outcome will soon be submitted to the concerned quarters,"" the commissioner said on Monday.
Sunanda was found dead in a suite in Leela Palace hotel in Chanakyapuri area in Delhi. Two staff members and Tharoor himself were present in the suite when they found her body.
Investigators said Sunanda's last call from her mobile phone was to her son Shiv Menon. The investigators have also verified the call detail record of her phone and have questioned all the people who spoke to her during the last two days of her life. Police said they have found from the call records that she also spoke to Pakistani journalist Mehr Tarar.
Sources close to the case developments told Mail Today: ""Delhi Police have got in touch with Tharoor after the first questioning during recording his statement. This is contrary to what is being speculated in a section of media that he's being quizzed by the police in the case?Police are probing on their own.""
Regarding allegations being levelled against Tharoor by senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader Subramanian Swamy, a source told Mail Today, ""It is best to ignore his despicable attempts.""
The investigators said undoubtedly there were several injury marks across Sunanda's body and it was because of a physical fight with her husband. ""They had got into a fight,"" said an investigator adding that the fight was over Pakistani journalist Mehr Tarar whom Sunanda had suspected of having an affair with her husband.
The post-mortem report also stated that there were over a dozen of injury marks across Sunanda's body but there were superficial in nature and not severe. The report also said Sunanda had minor bruises on her left cheek.
The post-mortem report also indicated that she died of poisoning. However, the police would be able to know the nature of the poison found in her body only after receiving the viscera report.
""It is too early to conclude anything as of now since the south district police is investigating all angles in this murder mystery,"" said a senior police officer, requesting anonymity.
The officer said Sunanda had starved herself for two days and was also consuming alcohol during her stay at the posh hotel. Revelations The autopsy report also stated that no food samples were found in her stomach, indicating that she hadn't eaten anything in the last two days. A panel of three AIIMS doctors also suggested that she had not been eating.
The sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) who recorded statements in the 'mysterious death' case had also ordered the Delhi police to investigate whether it was a case of homicide, suicide or accident.
""I have ordered the Delhi Police to further probe the mysterious death of Sunanda Pushkar as she is found to have died due to poisoning,"" Alok Sharma, the SDM of Vasant Vihar, said.
The police said three empty strips of Alprax (0.5mg) medicine, apart from other medicines, including botox antiaging injections, was found in her hotel room.
Swamy claims Sunanda given 'russian poison'
Giving a fresh twist to the Sunanda Pushkar case, senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Monday claimed the wife of Union Minister Shashi Tharoor did not commit suicide and her death was a gruesome murder.
Subramanian Swamy Subramanian Swamy
Swamy questioned Tharoor nervousness regarding his wife's death, even as the Delhi Police investigation in the highprofile case is still not complete. Sunanda was found dead in a posh Delhi hotel days after she was locked in a bitter Twitter row with Pakistani journalist Mehr Tarar.
""Why is Shashi Tharoor feeling so nervous? He should be one who should be standing up and say I want a complete inquiry to be done. Why did he get rushed through the cremation of his wife within a day? This is ridiculous. There are many things which are wrong with it,"" Swamy said, adding that Sunanda had horrific injuries above her belly and ""her nostrils were squeezed to open her mouth to administer Russian poison.""
Interestingly, this is not the first time that Swamy has spoken on Sunanda's private life. Earlier, Swamy had alleged that the Union Minister had misused his office to get his son out of prison in the UAE.
""What prompted a Union minister from Kerala to use his office to get his son out of jail in UAE? Due to narcotic trafficking charges,"" Swamy had tweeted in the first week of January this year. Tharoor had responded to Swamy's charges, saying the allegations were ""a bigot's perverse political agenda"".
The Delhi Police, on its part, has flatly rejected Swamy's claim that he had got the details about Sunanda's death through his ""sources in Delhi Police''. ""I can't comment on what grounds Mr Swamy is making these allegations when the probe is not yet complete,'' a Delhi Police officer said.

Swamy claimed Tharoor wants to make his wife's death seems like a natural death but the post-mortem reports stated that it was unnatural death. ""Why is Tharoor so keen to declare the case as death due to natural causes? We want to get to the bottom of the matter. What is the need to have no photos taken of her body? Whatever photos were taken was destroyed. The Delhi police probe is not moving forward.
Police sources told me in private that it is a gruesome murder,"" he claimed. The BJP leader also gave indication that when his party-led NDA comes to power at the Centre, he will ""take the case to its conclusion.'' ""I will have to file either a public interest litigation, or when there is a government that is more responsive to the public like Narendra Modi's government. At that time, I will take it up and see that it (the case) is brought to a conclusion,"" he said."
104,"Issue Date: Dec 31, 1986",[],2014-02-21 11:05:34,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"Marriage is no longer a sacred word and divorce no longer a dirty one. A significantly growing number of Indians are flooding the divorce courts to escape from unhappy marriages and assert their new found independence. For better or for worse, divorce has become the way out. Times have changed and with them, women have changed as well. Principal Correspondent Madhu Jain investigates this new phenomenon that has overturned a rock-solid institution in the last 10 years. The paintings and drawings are from the Man-Woman series by eminent painter Jatin Das.
Couple 1: She liked Beethoven and Bach. He liked jazz, Elton John and Nat King Cole. She fed on Shakespeare and Yeats. He whiled away his Sunday afternoons with James Hadley Chase and a bottle of beer. Love, alas, did not overcome the differences and two years later dreams of conjugal bliss lay shattered in the paan-stained rooms of Delhi's Tis Hazari courts.
Earlier only the very rich or the very poor divorced, today the middle class - the last line of defence against changing manners and morals - has succumbed.
Couple 2: He, a Bengali teacher, could not tolerate food cooked in coconut oil any longer. She, born and brought up in Kerala, could not do without it. After four years, the once fairy-tale affair sizzled in the kitchen and ended in divorce.
Couple 3: She, convent educated with a Masters in English Literature, came from a small, urbane family. He, a successful businessman came from a burgeoning joint family that began to spill over from Ludhiana into her Delhi home. The wife rushed to court before the mother-in-law could establish her empire in the house.
Divorce, 1980s style, is never saying you are sorry. Marriages are falling apart at the tiniest tug. The distance between an argument and the courts is shrinking and in some cases disappearing altogether. And, divorce is no longer something that happens to other people.
The last decade has brought legal divorce home to the average Indian, painfully and fast. Earlier only the very rich or the very poor got divorced, but today the middle class - the last line of defence against changing manners and morals - has succumbed. Divorce has now, in fact, gone democratic, fashionable, mundane even.
School teachers, receptionists, petty traders, government servants, insurance agents and, of course, housewives fill the courts. They are coming out of their bedrooms, their kitchens and from under their mothers-in-law's thumbs. Says Bayeshri Parikh, one of the two marriage counsellors attached to the Bombay city courts: ""Most of the divorce cases come from the Rs 800 to Rs 1,500 income group. I have seen this pattern emerge over the last 10 years.""
As the courts overflow with quarrelling couples, many cities have had to create special matrimonial dispute courts. Delhi has five additional district and sessions judges: in 1965 there was only a sub-judge. Bombay has three city courts for divorce; three years ago it had one. Ahmedabad has two, and needs a third.
Divorce is on the increase to such an extent that an alarmed government has set up reconciliation bureaus in the major cities. Although it has not quite attained Californian proportions, divorce in India is multiplying at an ever-increasing rate. In Delhi nearly 25 divorce petitions are filed every day.
In Bombay cases have more than doubled during the last decade. Punjab and Haryana are not too far behind: divorce cases reaching the high court in Chandigarh increased 147 per cent during the last decade. Kerala in the vanguard for many things has a head start on divorce as well: the number of divorce petitions in the Trivandrum Magistrate's Court made a quantum leap of 328 per cent during the last nine years.
The number of divorce applications increased more than fourfold in the Bhopal District Court in the last seven years; and this year show a further increase. In Calcutta, there has been a marked, although gradual increase in divorce. Even in Madras, usually the bastion of tradition, there has been an annual increase of about 10 per cent in the number of divorces. Every district has a divorce court, and in Madras there were 800 cases filed this year.
Industrialisation and urbanisation are eating into the already fragile bonds of marriage. Life in the metropolises has become extremely tense and brittle.
Alarming though they may be, city court figures are merely indicators of a trend, applicable as they are only to marriages performed under the Special Marriage Act or the Hindu Marriage Act. Generally divorce amongst Christians, Parsis and Muslims is not included - as also tribal and panchayati divorces. Dowry-related or maintenance cases filed under Section 125 of the Indian Penal Code are also excluded from the court figures.
The ""court chalo"" movement in matters matrimonial is rapidly gaining wide acceptance. The middle class has shed its frail robes of decorum, and as if making up for lost time, is rushing to court at the drop of a hat. Nearly 90 per cent of the 2,000 cases which come to the Legal Aid Board in New Delhi's local courts come from this large segment.
Even villagers have begun to flock to the lower courts to get the sarkar to put a stamp on their marital problems. Says a Delhi matrimonial judge: ""Initially the panchayat would resolve matrimonial disputes, but legal aid societies, and women's groups have helped the poor get to the courts.""
Take Sundara (names of divorcees have been fictionalised to protect their identities), a maid in a Bombay flat on Marine Drive, who went to the courts to divorce her almost completely blind husband who lives in Ratnagiri. Sundara wanted a legal divorce because she feared that the village panchayat would force her to stay in Ratnagiri and look after her husband and his mother. ""I would not have done it had he not been so cruel to me. He and his mother never gave me anything to eat, never bought me any clothes, and he would drink and beat me."" Her case was taken up by Anusuya Dutt, Bombay's well-known divorce lawyer, who got her an ex-parte divorce.
Inevitably, it's boom time for lawyers. There are as many as 12,000 cases for judicial separation pending in various courts of Madhya Pradesh according to official sources. Delhi has over 2,000 pending cases. Bombay is not far behind. Until a few years ago landlord-tenant litigation was the most lucrative part of a lawyer's business, especially in Delhi.
Now it's matrimonial disputes that keep the lawyers ticking. Says Usha Mehra, registrar, Delhi High Court: ""In 1965 I had only one or two matrimonial dispute cases. In the 1970s I was handling about 15 to 20 divorce cases. In the early '80s I had over 100 cases, and since then the number is growing much faster.""
A dignified lawyer with 30 years of practice, who insists on anonymity, says he has handled ""over 200 divorce cases during the last eight years"". He claims there is a ""500 per cent increase"" in divorce cases. The story is much the same in many other metropolitan cities; the numbers might differ but the percentages of increase are comparable.
Where divorce seems a lengthy, inconvenient procedure, more and more people are even converting to Islam as the shortest, most convenient distance between two marriages. Meera, in her mid-20s and the daughter of a retired defence officer, refused her husband a divorce when he fell in love with another woman.
Unfazed, the husband went to a qazi who converted him and the other woman to Islam and then performed a nikaah. Meera had no choice but to divorce her husband. Later the husband went to an Arya Samaj Mandir and became a Hindu once again.
The pati-parmeshwar has rudely and gradually been brought down to earth; he has lost the divine right of the gods to do as he pleases.
The turning point for divorce came in 1976 with the inclusion of mutual consent in the Special Marriage Act of 1954. Divorce was not quite instant but it was quicker: one year's wait after the first motion, six months after the second. In small towns like Panipat, divorce is almost as easy as instant coffee. All it costs is Rs 5 worth of notary stamps, the fees of a glib lawyer, and couples go away thinking they are legally divorced.
Other small cities are also getting on the divorce bandwagon. In Ahmedabad, the number of divorces went up from 256 in 1978 to 319 in 1985 (50 per cent increase). Until April 1986, 270 petitions had already been filed in the civil courts. This number does not include Christians and Muslims; nor women who flock to voluntary organisations like Jyoti Sangh which in April alone had 198 new cases of matrimonial disputes.
Since divorce is no longer a dirty word, divorcees are coming out of their closets, comfortably and without shame. A barometer of the state of the conjugal affairs of the nation is matrimonial advertisements. Until recently, only the hands of homely virgins, well-versed in the art of cooking and sewing and of sweet disposition were either being asked for or proffered. Today, divorcees clearly and unambiguously announce their marital state with the qualifying ""legally divorced"".
But why are so many marriages falling apart? A major reason could be the fading stigma of divorce. It is no longer a fate worse than death. If anything, it is turning out to be an escape from it. The number of dowry deaths, bride-burnings and the huge amount of publicity generated by them have convinced many parents that a divorced daughter is better than a dead one.
The reasons for divorce are many but dowry demands predominate in both, the city and the villages. Social worker Sita Devi from Panipat puts it in one word: greed. ""This colour television is a problem for women and refrigerators an illness,"" she says. ""Some parents can't give these things and their daughters' lives are ruined. Many brides are sent back to the parents' houses if they are not burnt before.""
Interestingly enough, divorce has now found respect in communities where it was previously unthinkable. Says Ela Bhatt of sewa: ""Gujarati simplicity is no longer a virtue. Social mobility has entered the working class and some of the castes are trying to demand dowries to improve their status - even among Christians and Muslims. Divorce often follows. Parents have begun to stop forcing their daughters back because they fear suicide or murder - and afterwards their own guilt.""
Marriages are changing because women are changing - both, in the metropolis and in the smaller towns. The long-suffering woman who stoically bore indignity upon indignity in silence is now largely confined to the celluloid descendants of Nirupa Roy and company. The pati-parmeshwar has rudely been brought down to earth; he has lost the divine rights of the gods to do as he pleases. Says Nirmala, a receptionist in an office in Delhi: ""If my husband is a pati-parmeshwar, he must be so for his family. Not for me.""
Nirmala, although brought up in a very conservative family, walked out of her four-year-old marriage because she could no longer tolerate being beaten by her husband. ""Physical violence cuts across all classes - from Ph.Ds to bastis. Ninety percent of our matrimonial disputes cases involve violence,"" adds Parbeen Garewal from Saheli, an activist woman's group in Delhi. According to Indira Jaisingh, the well-known lawyer from Bombay: ""Women are no longer willing to tolerate physical or mental cruelty and indignity within the framework of marriage.""
The stigma of divorce is fading. It's no longer a fate worse than death. Dowry deaths have taught parents that a divorced daughter is better than a dead one.
Contributing in large measure to this sea-change in women and the blurring of the sati-savitri image is the fact that more and more women are getting educated. The media has also played a large role in making women aware of their legal rights. Earlier men used to file divorce petitions: today more and more women are filing them. Says Justice D.M. Vasavada of the City Civil Court in Ahmedabad: ""There is a noticeable change in women coming to the courts; they are not at all afraid of divorce anymore.""
A few years ago women would hesitate even entering court rooms. Today whether it is a small town in Madhya Pradesh or a cosmopolitan city like Bombay, the women have learnt to walk out of the protective cocoon of the home and speak up in court. Says Usha Mehra: ""I used to go to the girl's house and take her to court; even her parents would not come. These days the girls reach the court all by themselves.""
If the subject of divorce was taboo in middle class homes a few years ago, it is now openly discussed in drawing-rooms. Most offices have a few divorcees, many families a relative who is divorced. Says Ramesh, a public sector engineer: ""Divorce was something I would not have imagined in my wildest dreams. Nobody in my family knew anybody who was divorced. But my marriage had become so bad that I had to. Today even my parents have accepted it.""
The growing independence of women from all strata of society and their ability to walk out of a bad marriage is directly related to the increase in the number of working women. ""A woman has now learned that she has equal rights. She is conscious of her individual identity and has shown the ability to take the brunt of life; she can earn and look after the household. In some cases she is far more capable than her husband,"" says Chandramani Chopra, a Delhi lawyer.
But then working couples are also more likely to split. The strains are far greater. Salaries of the working women have become a bone of contention. In many of the middle class marriages, mothers-in-law, if not the husbands themselves, want the entire salary of the daughter-in-law.
Renu, a telephone operator in Jaipur, had to give her entire salary to her mother-in-law. The latter gave her Rs 2 for her bus fare every day. Prabha, a librarian in Ahmedabad, divorced her husband after 14 years. ""If I have to give all my salary to look after his family, I might as well go home and look after my own parents.""
Working couples have other factors that pull them apart. Most men actually resent their wives working: they are caught between greed (a working wife is a renewable dowry) and possessiveness. Many middle class Indian males are insanely jealous about their working wives. They feel insecure not only about the earning power of their wives, but of their fidelity as well.
Radha, a typist in a small Delhi firm, divorced her husband, a travelling salesman, three years ago. He had wanted her to work - they needed the extra income. But he soon became jealous to the point of insanity. ""He even became suspicious of the servant. When he used to come back from his tours, he would ask why there were two head impressions on the pillow. He would call my office four or five times a day to see if I was there. Once after a five-day tour he took me to a doctor for a medical check-up to make sure that I had not been with a man. Often he got drunk and beat me; he also tried to strangle me two or three times.""
Industrialisation and urbanisation are eating into the already fragile bonds of middle and lower middle class marriages. Life in the cities, particularly in metropolises like Bombay and Delhi has become extremely tense and brittle. Alcoholism and, to a growing extent, smack add to the strains of marriage. According to Freny Ponda, president of the Federation of Women Lawyers: ""Phobias, fetishes, drug addiction are more in evidence now. Drug addiction can make men impotent, which in turn leads them to beat their wives.""
Privacy is another casualty of urbanisation. Says Parikh: ""Many couples are not sexually satisfied. In one case there were three couples living in one room: three brothers and their wives. They divided the night: for two hours one brother and his wife remained inside while the other two outside.""
The burgeoning number of sex clinics for ""health and happy married life"" and street-corner aphrodisiac salesmen are testimony to another kind of sexual problem in India: impotence. Sex and sensuality divorced each other a long time ago in the middle class.
The sexual life of this class is on the whole, quite bleak and miserable. Divya, recently divorced, confessed somewhat shyly: ""There was hardly any mental relationship between my husband and me, and physical intimacy was becoming very difficult. I always had the feeling that people were listening, the walls were so thin.""
In the lower income groups, sexual contact is often hurried and furtive, to be over and done with quietly and before the others wake up. Feelings and sentiments are upper class luxuries.
Says psychoanalyst Sudhir Kakar: ""Sexual incompatibility is very rarely acknowledged: most people would not even admit it to themselves. Sexual expectations are so low that sexual reality fits in with those low expectations."" Still, it does quietly put its own strains on an already teetering marriage. Divorce is then the only safety valve for the tensions of married life.
The traditional power struggle between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law (over who wears the keys of the house) continues. Power games begin soon after the marriage. The rather intense relationship between mother and son in most parts of India has traditionally loaded the dice in favour of the mother-in-law.
Bombay psychoanalyst Udayan Patel describes a common enough phenomenon: ""I have many cases of middle-aged women who cannot let go of their sons. Some have gone along on the honeymoons. One of them even placed her bed squarely in front of the bedroom of the young couple and insisted on their leaving the door open.""
But if mothers-in-law are not changing, the daughters-in-law are. The new, young aggressive bride no longer wants a mother-in-law as a wedding gift from her husband. She wants her rights now, unlike yesterday's woman who was conditioned by her parents to love, honour and obey both, the husband and the mother-in-law.
Shiela, newly-married and freshly divorced says: ""I used to have the normal fantasies and romantic notions about marriage - blue curtains, white cupboards and lots of little cushions strewn about the place. Our house had all that fake heavy brocade and plyboard. There was nothing lacking in the house but it Was not mine.""
Nuclear families have their own special problems. There is no older, soothing voice of reason, and life for a working wife is almost impossible in big cities. She has to commute long distances, at the end of which lies a mountain load of housework Role conflicts take place. The man does not want to share the responsibility of the housework, but he does want the warm chapatis.
It is no easier in the smaller cities. Says Daksha Bhatt, an Ahmedabad lawyer: ""For a Gujarati working woman it is very difficult: our puris are tiny and chapatis almost paper thin, a man eats nearly ten, and most Gujarati men want them hot. The woman is already tired; tension is to be expected.""
But while marriage may not be every couple's cup of tea, divorce is still too bitter a brew for many. Many women would still die a thousand deaths before being divorced; they fear complete economic and social isolation. Maintenance laws often let the husband off very lightly; and even in cases where the judge has stipulated an amount to be given to the wife, it is just a pittance.
A significant and disturbing trend emerging over the last four or five years is that women have begun to give up custody of their children. Until a few years ago, both husband and wife fought to keep the child. Now a few women are leaving their children to grow up in a lonely, fragmented world.
Some lawyers actually advise their women clients not to ask for custody. Kirti Singh, a Delhi lawyer who specialises in family law, puts it quite plainly: ""I advise my clients to become detached from their children and give up custody. What future is there for a young woman with two or three children? She can marry again. Why should she not be able to begin life again?""
Many women are forced to take this heart-rending decision because they cannot look after their children - there is quite simply no place for them to live. Working women's hostels do not allow children. Women who return to their father's - and now brother's - house are usually badly, even cruelly treated.
Sunita, a typist in a government department gave up custody of her son when she went to live with her brother and his wife. ""I was helpless,"" she says. ""What tore me apart was the taunting tone of my bhabhi. She gave her son the best things to eat and treated my child very badly. He said nothing but I knew that he was inwardly crying His own father would at least treat him properly.""
Another disturbing trend is that more and more old people are getting divorced, specially among Parsis. Says Ponda, who handles many such cases: ""They want to spend the remainder of their life in peace. Some do not want their husbands or wives to inherit their property: they feel that disinheritance by will won't be enough. When approaching death many old people do not want their spouse to get their property.""
Parsis are not the only ones. Dutt has a growing number of such clients. ""Often marital problems surface when the children go away."" Parikh talks about an elderly couple who came to the stage of a divorce because of a dispute over which child should inherit the property.
The fragile state of the Indian marriage has begun to worry the legal profession and the Government. Reconciliation bureaus, Lok Adalats - Justice P.N. Bhagwati-inspired - for matrimonial disputes are being set up in desperation. The reconciliation bureaus are, however, more of a bazaar.
Social workers, lawyers, representatives of various women's groups - most of them with their target-oriented approach bear an unfortunate resemblance to social workers on population control missions - try and hurry as much as they can through reconciliations. And reconciliation might not quite be the best thing in many cases.
Meena is scared to go back to her husband. She says: ""If I go back, he will kill me. I know he meant to kill me when my chunni caught fire the other day; he was standing behind me. He even told me in the court just now: 'See what I do to you when you come back. How dare you insult me like this.' I can never go back."" Hardly 10 per cent of the cases referred to the bureaus ever get resolved.
There are no happy endings in the world of the divorced: few live happily ever after. Seven-year-old Ashok is at the Bombay City Court: the social worker is supervising the weekly meetings of Ashok and his mother, Beena. Beena dashes into the room, immaculately dressed. But within minutes, sweat begins to streak the carefully powdered face.
She is half an hour late for the appointment with her son. Her ex-husband, she cries, tricked her, gave her the wrong time. There is only half an hour before he comes to take his son back. The child, unsmiling does not look at his mother. The beautifully wrapped present lies next to him, unopened.
The mother tugs at his sleeve, then pulls him towards her with greater force. The child shrinks further away; he looks at his watch. The silence is killing. The distance between mother and child stretches with each meeting, the hatred of his parents for each other is too heavy a burden for his young shoulders. For Ashok, the journey in this broken, sad world has only just begun.
MEN: ODD MAN OUT
Life after divorce can be traumatic for a man as well. Society raises its eyebrows at him too but he does not have to wear his marital status on the forehead as is the case with women. It is much easier, too, for the male divorcee to get married and start a home again.
But divorce is never pretty nor life easy after it. The ""single father"" has to start from scratch. Pampered by his mother and spoiled further by his wife, most males have to begin with elementary lessons in child and house-keeping.
Naresh, an affable executive in his early '40s who works in Bombay, was divorced three years ago. His wife had fallen in love with another man, leaving him with their two children. Bitterness still sits around his mouth, although he often breaks into ironic smiles.
""Socially, I am still looked upon with suspicion. Friends who used to invite us as a couple now call only one of us; or they drop us all together. I am not quite considered a single man. A divorced man is supposed to have something wrong with him.""
Divorce takes a lot out of a man. For women it is much easier to adapt to a new life. A professional woman is far more resilient than the male; a man cannot absorb the shocks as well. Divorce shakes a man's confidence in himself. He cannot approach another woman without apprehension. Some even begin to doubt their manliness.
""Of course, I feel lonely. I try and return home as late as possible from work. I make sure that I travel a great deal.""
The 'single father' starts from scratch. Pampered by mother and spoilt by wife, most males begin with the elementary lessons in child and house-keeping.
""To be a single parent father is terrible. My sons go to my wife over the weekends and she showers them with presents while I have to dish out the discipline.""
Mohan, a timid-looking government official whose wife left him because she refused to live with his parents, has been on his own for the last three years. His children come and visit him occasionally. But he has not been able to face life. Says he: ""I feel like a fool when I go to a party. I feel people look at me differently. Now they shrink away. I feel like an untouchable, a tresspasser.""
To overcome my loneliness I have kept a dog. The dog loves me but it is not enough. My children do come to see me but I feel they no longer respect me. Their mother has taught them to dislike me. They behave awkwardly with me and I no longer know what to say to them. I feel the odd-man out with my brother's family. One just becomes an extra wherever one goes.
""My most difficult hour is between evening and nightfall. All kinds of depressing thoughts go through my mind. Today everything is in a mess. My loneliness has become acute but I am afraid to marry again.""
WOMEN: BITTER REBIRTH
Divorce is no longer such a dirty word in India: there is life after divorce for an Indian woman. But it is as painful as birth; it is, in fact, rebirth. She has to pick up the pieces of her shattered lite and self-confidence and reassemble them to face an insensitive world where the laws of Manu, dictate that a woman's locus standi is through her father to begin with, then her husband and finally her son.
The divorcee is always wrong. Whether she belongs to the upper classes or to the basti.
For Kamani, it was exceptionally difficult. Ten years ago, she ran away and married against her parents' wishes. Her family, upper middle class and conservative, broke with her completely. And it was to them that she had-to return, penniless, with two small children, eating her words.
""My first problems were with the family. I was an embarrassment to them. I was a second-class citizen in my parents' home. I had to fight; I had to become hard. It was my independent nature which finally won me respect. I refused to become a burden on my parents, either financially or emotionally.""
Next came the world. As far as men go, it has been terrible. A widow or a divorcee is like a bitch on heat and all the dogs on the street, stray or pedigree come along and sniff. I will never forget the time I first went to a dinner alone.
A man sitting next to me, well-known and admired in Delhi's social circles, casually asked me where my husband was. When I told him that I was divorced, the polite manner changed. 'How could you have done without sex for so long?' He actually propositioned me right there.
""But women are even worse. Their hackles rise if you go near their husbands. Suddenly, my closest friends became cold and distant towards me.""
Leela, 34, had never worked until after her divorce. She worshipped her husband and thought she had a blissful marriage which followed a wine and roses romance. Delicate, but with a fragile intensity, she has finally shed the old self-doubts after three hard years:
The new aggressive bride no longer wants a mother-in-law as a wedding gift from her husband. She wants her rights now, unlike the woman of yesterday.
""Until a few months ago I used to feel vulnerable walking into a party. I'd silently pray that I would not drink and break down. The question always asked was what does your husband do. This would leave me speechless until finally one day my mumbles started to become coherent. I would force myself to say that I was divorced. When I first discovered that my husband was seeing another woman I began to think that there was something terribly wrong with me. My husband tried to assuage his own guilt by telling me how mentally inadequate and sexually zilsch I was.""
""Yes, there was physical violence. Shortly after our marriage, he hit me because he thought I was disrespectful to his parents. The breakdown of a marriage is like death. It may not be the death of a husband but it is the death of a marriage and you must mourn it.""
Further down the social ladder, the vulnerabilities of a divorced woman change. Men may not proposition her at parties but only because she does not go to them. But colleagues in the office consider her an easy target. And relatives can be cruel, as indeed can society at large.
Sushma, in her mid-20s, returned home to her parents in west Delhi 10 days after an arranged marriage. Her husband was impotent, had no job, and had studied no further than the fifth class.
The pundit who had arranged the marriage had described him as a graduate who ran his own printing press and owned the house he lived in. Sushma is lively and an extrovert. She has bright eyes, but she broke down three times during the interview. Now with a woman's organisation, she helps women like herself get to grips with life.
""When I first went back home, I wanted to kill myself. I kept telling my parents to sell the house and move to a place where nobody would know about my marriage. I could then marry again. My mother and I went underground, to Bombay.""
The neighbours were told that I had gone back to my sasural. On my return to Delhi I changed the market I went to, my doctor. The same questions worried me: what would the mohalla say? Who would marry my two sisters?...
""Very few people accept divorce. Whenever there was a function in the house, I was looked upon as inauspicious. Most people believe something is wrong with the girl.""
""I have made my life but I do feel lonely. Who can I turn to?""
""Yes, I would like to marry again. But who will marry a divorcee?""
CHILDREN: CRUEL CUT
Sarita, fragile for her four years, is quite literally in no-man's land. Her parents divorced recently. Neither now wants her. ""She will interfere with my life,"" says the mother. ""I can't keep her,'' declares the father. The grandfather sadly shakes his head: ""How long have I to live. What happens after I go?"" For Urmil Kapur, a Delhi lawyer, this is the most heart-rending of her divorce cases. Finally, she persuades the reluctant young father to take back his little daughter.
Most children of divorced parents lead a volleyball existence: thrown from one side to the other without a safety net for their emotions. On the surface of it, a divorced child - divorced from parents as a unit - looks like any other. But the loss of a home can be more traumatic than the death of a parent, more so when the child is a battleground for the parents.
Sheena, with large eyes that seem to take in the whole world, is six. Her parents divorced two years ago after an ugly court battle. Soon after, her father married another woman. For a year she got bad attacks of asthma and constantly sucks her thumb. She lives with her mother in South Delhi.
The mother: ""My sadness has travelled to Sheena. Particularly when I see her looking at other children and their parents. It took me a long time to tell my child why her father did not live with us. She is curious, always asking questions but never about her father's new wife.
""She misses her father. She used to try and get us together in the most touching ways. She would ask her father to bring something for me and then say: 'See, he loves you more.'
""She is more mature than most children her age. But she has these uncontrollable bouts of crying, as if she wants to take out something from within her.""
Most children of divorced parents lead a volleyball existence: they are thrown from one side to the other without a safety net for their emotions.
""School was a problem. Children can be so cruel. Often, she retreats into a world of make-believe: she makes up a story about all of us going out together for her friends.""
Roopesh, 8, has circles under his eyes. He is fretful and has trouble concentrating on his studies. He lives with his father who owns a small provisions shop in Jaipur. Rani, his mother is an employee in an insurance company and lives in her brother's house in west Delhi.
Rani gave up custody of her child two years after her divorce because of the step-child treatment given to him there. Her son, witness to his parents' fights, did not speak until he was four. Says Rani: ""When my husband used to beat me, Roopesh would just sit in a corner without uttering a word. One day when my husband was violent, my son tried to stop him from beating me.""
""I miss my son. I have often thought of getting him back. But I have to work. What if nobody goes to the bus stand to pick him up? I am so nervous, wondering whether he crossed the road safely.""
Abha and Raman: Abha, wise beyond her nine years and slow to warm to people and Raman, 6, babyish and given to tantrums, live with their mother, Gita in New Delhi. Gita works in a publicity firm. Her story:
""Abha never asked me about her father. Life had become unsettled a few months before I left my husband. She had seen a few nasty scenes between us. She would say nothing; but, those nights she would have bad dreams or wet her bed. She was three when I left Calcutta. Raman was only six months.""
The problems began to surface when Abha turned six. It first hit her in nursery - during a lesson on the family: the mother, the father, the son and the daughter and their roles. And the questions began. Abha would fret about not having a mother who stayed at home, why no anniversaries were celebrated, why was their father's name never mentioned?
""I first began to tell them the truth through bedtime stories. They clung to every word: how we had met, what the problems were. They understood but life has not been easy. I had to be both mother and father. Sometimes I had to be much tougher. A woman would never dream of boxing. It hurts like hell but I have to do it.""
''Most difficult of all has been getting them into schools. I was grilled about the hows and whys of my divorce. Homework is another problem. The children are not doing as well as they should. My children are still vulnerable. When people ask my daughter where her father is, she says, 'Calcutta'. She never uses the word divorce.""
DIVORCE LAW: NEW NEEDS
Divorce has become easier and quicker now but not less ugly. The courts are still draconian, lawyers tricky. Also it is beyond the pale for the poor.
Divorce under Hindu law was not recognised until the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 which provides for both judicial separation and divorce. The major simplification came in 1976 with the introduction of divorce by mutual consent into both the Hindu Marriage Act and the Special Marriage Act.
Section 13 B of the Act maintains that if the couple have lived apart for a year and file a decree for judicial separation, the court can grant one. The court may at the same time specify an amount to be paid lumpsum or at regular intervals.
Under Muslim law men have a unilateral right of divorce. The Muslim male can by pronouncing talak three times in front of his wife divorce her. A Muslim woman on the other hand can only divorce her husband if he permits her to or if she goes to court.
The Muslim Marriage Act of 1939 gave women additional rights for divorce: if the husband has not been heard of for four years, if he has not given maintenance for over two years, imprisonment, impotency, insanity, leprosy, cruelty, or if the woman has been married before puberty.
The distance between an argument and the courts is shrinking and in some cases disappearing. Divorce is no longer something that happens to other people.
Under the Indian Divorce Act which pertains to Christians, women can sue for divorce on grounds of adultery only if it is in addition to either rape, bestiality, cruelty or desertion. For a man adultery alone is grounds enough for divorce.
However, the institution of Section 498 A last year under cruelty to women and Section 406 in 1984 which relates to the criminal misappropriation of property have made it easier for women to file for divorce.
Many women, however, do not want to give up their marital status because they believe that they will be left alone and bereft of any economic stability. Maintenance and property laws are not in favour of women. Only a third of the man's income is to be given to his wife. Moreover, most men do not declare their entire income and it is difficult for the lawyers to prove their real income.
Most lawyers feel that more changes in legislation are required. Says Kirti Singh, a specialist in family law in Delhi: ""Irretrievable breakdown of marriage should be introduced into the legislation but simultaneously it should cast the duty on the court to see that the women and the children are financially able to sustain themselves. Before granting a divorce the court should ask the man how his wife and children will be able to live."""

Alcoholism is sometimes a response to an intolerable situation which can be made more bearable by drinking. Hence the right cure would be to find the root of the problem instead of fighting it with drugs or aversion therapy.
Shimla Vivek Mohan
I am a self-confessed alcoholic. Alcoholism is no respector of any human being. I took my first drink thinking it would bring me more pleasure, more friends, more status but this was only a pleasant delusion. The last five years of my sojourn with alcohol were terrible. I pawned and sold everything to buy more alcohol. I made countless resolutions, broke every one, was hospitalised thrice and underwent psychiatric treatment. Nothing made a difference. Only Alcoholics Anonymous did. Their one day at a time rule is indeed a golden rule.
Bombay Ganesh
Drinking has become a social necessity and man's social status seems to rise or fall with the quality and quantity of liquor he is able to hand out. A non-drinker finds himself isolated at any function and to be accepted as a civilised individual he begins to drink. Even more distressing is the fact that youngsters have taken to it in a big way simply because it is equated with manliness.
Chandrapur Prakash Prabharat
I believe that Hindi films contribute largely to the growing popular appeal of drinking in this country. Nearly every film has the hero guzzling booze (generally a bottle of Vat 69) and looking very pleased with himself. The same man is shown young and carefree, dancing with the heroine, righting all manner of people in the most outrageous situations for his self-respect. And finally comes tragedy. The audience identifies with him and imitates him completely, even throwing back drinks like he did, not bothering to see the bottle for its evil.
Rajkot D.P. Bhatt
The cover story did not shock, it only surprised. It is only expected that alcoholism will increase with population. This means that there is more frustration and deterioration of morals. Eradication is impossible.

An alcoholic is not just the problem of his family but should also be the concern of the society in general. As he is a public nuisance, neighbours should join together to humiliate him. This method has been successful in Manipur, where the women have got together to deal with the problem.

Alcoholism is a socially accepted evil which has assumed insidious dimensions. Only a mass-based movement, which by its very nature enjoys wide popular backing, can help the people in their battle against the bottle.
Pathankot Ravi Kant Bhatia
Your intention to educate people about alcoholism is well-timed. Arrack sale legalised a few years back in Tamil Nadu has unfortunately increased the number of its consumers. Alcoholics, many of them in a highly inebriated state, can now be seen drinking till the wee hours in arrack shops. The income generated is enormous and all this at the expense of the working class whose women and children suffer.
Nandanam Franklyn Stanley
Considering the climate in this country, alcohol is injurious to drinkers. But the state governments will not bring in total prohibition. The lobby of vested interests argues that prohibition will only be an incentive to illicit distilling and bootlegging, which is a loss to the Government. This is a fallacious argument for the brewing of raw drink is common and uncontrolled. Illicit distillation is mainly on economic grounds and has nothing to do with prohibition.
Bombay D.P. Birla
In north-eastern India alcohol has become the root cause of all evil in society. Country liquor is cheaply and freely available and has devastating effects. Facilities for de-addiction should be provided in this part of the country too.

As far as I am concerned, I have never visited Alcoholics Anonymous anywhere any time.As a grateful and recovering member of the wonderful fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous, I wish to express my appreciation for your lead story on alcoholism. AA has perhaps one of the most successful programmes for treating addicts. I would also like to add that we at AA have no desire to dry up the world. Our purpose is to stay sober and help alcoholics achieve sobriety.The only hope for Punjab (""Upsurge of Violence"", April 15) lies in weaning the mass of Sikhs away from the militants. Those who believe that the militants can be suppressed by physical force are living in a world of illusion. Heinous as their crimes are the reactions of the press, government and political parties only help the militants cause. The people wonder why these same groups did not condemn as vociferously the murder of innocent Sikhs in June and October 1984. Why were those guilty of murder then let off, while those picked up as extremists are still kept in custody. Tackling militancy in Punjab is a delicate task requiring an understanding of the Sikh psyche.and othersThe unending crisis in the state is a pointer to the inefficiency and apathy of the Punjab Government, both the present and the erstwhile ones, in dealing with the fissiparous forces who are out to sunder the country. Determination has been the hallmark of the terrorists, and by their well-planned attacks on innocent people, they have time and again proved that they have the support of alien forces.The communal vein in the terrorist violence is disturbing. The divide between the two major communities in the state seems to be total. The police is totally demoralised and communal. Ribeiro's appointment should boost the sagging morale of the police.Punjab has become another pawn on the political chess-board. Moves are made without consulting the people and the Government's decision is forcing people to make moves that they don't want to. The state needs to tread carefully.The Government's policy of interfering and not allowing the police or those responsible for maintaining law and order to concentrate on one task has meant the weakening of defences. The state is bowing down to the terrorists' sinister designs by not ensuring communal harmony. It's an 'Upsurge of Super-Violence'.Sometimes the Punjab problem seems quite hopeless. I can't understand why people feel Hindus and Sikhs are not brothers. Sikhism is as much a part of the Hindu religion as Shaivism and Vaishnavism.Peace can only be brought back to Punjab by force. If we want peace we must prepare ourselves for war against the terrorists acting at the behest of foreign powers. Every party should unite and work jointly, fired by a spirit of national solidarity. National integration is the weapon for our survival.If the people unite to resist the growing communalism, the terrorists will be demoralised and return to the mainstream. The Akali Government should not be so weak-kneed.In your Special Report (""Operation Disarm"" April 15), you did not emphasise the fact that the verification procedure for the issue of gun licences is hardly likely to improve the efficiency of the understaffed Uttar Pradesh police. If the Government had the foresight to consider an armed people as a deterrent to crime, such senseless projects would never see the light of day.At a time when law and order is practically non-existent and the police ineffective, people must be allowed to make arrangements for their own protection. Gun licences must be abolished. History is with us in this regard. It was the British who first introduced the arms licence in India, to disarm the Indian people, after suppressing the 1857 mutiny.Your article faithfully echoes the sarkari tune regarding reducing the number of licensed weapons with citizens. Licensed weapons are rarely used in committing crimes - a fact which even the Lucknow SSP could have corroborated if he knew his facts. What needs to be curbed is the menace of illegal firearms which outnumber the former 10:1.""The Dues of Death"" (April 15) on the Dom Raja is poignant and moving. Choudhury's pathetic statement, ""If I open a shop who will come""? is a telling comment on our society. It is a pity that the scourge of untouchability is yet to free our hearts and minds.It is regrettable that a magazine of your stature has seen it to publish such bizarre and nightmarish photographs. They are nauseous, to say the least. I have hidden the issue from my children lest they get scared.Your article (""Poaching Problems"" April 15) has left out the fact that the IAS rules the roost in all departments. Rules are tailor-made to suit them. For instance. a deputation to the public sector means permanent absorption to all except IAS officers, who are free to jump from post to post. They refuse to work in the districts, except as very junior officers and the IAS is the only service where everybody rises to the level of additional secretary irrespective of competence.Tamil Nadu's chief minister (""The Fading Star"" April 15) has become a black hole! MGR is a spent force. He should gracefully retire when he is still widely admired and respected. After all, how long can Tamil Nadu tolerate this Rip Van Winkle?Your story (""Vulnerable Targets"" April 15) raises one question. When the banks do not take adequate security measures, why do the insurance companies compensate them? Is it because the compensation is paid out of public money and not out of their pockets? Also, insurance companies must insist on some security norms that all banks have to follow.Your article quotes Police Commissioner Soman as saying that ""nobody knows the procedure to be followed when there is a robbery"". But he conveniently forgot the police who issue gun licences indiscriminately, endangering innocent citizens.Your report on Sobh raj (""The Escape Scandal"" April 15) raises a very disturbing thought. If Ved Prakash Garg had not been sacked for leaking his letter to the press, and his suggestions accepted and implemented, Tihar jail would not be in the soup it is today. It also brings to mind President Zail Singh's statement about the prison: ""It is shocking, shameful and unbelievable.""(Retd)The Doordarshan article (""The Money Machine"" April 15) made shocking revelations about high-level corruption. Will 'Corruption in TV' figure as the next episode inOn the day I was reading your article, Doordarshan screened the telefilm Hum Nahin Sudhrmge, which centred on corruption. Perhaps by showing this film, which was suddenly brought in place of another film, Doordarshan wanted the viewers to know that things just won't improve.Your exposure of Air-India's manner of leasing freighter aircraft (""Double Dealing"", March 31) has put the airline's officials on the mat. Instead of setting their house in order, the Maharajah's men have inserted a quarter page advertisement in leading newspapers in defence. There is nothing new in their denials, which could have been made through a press release as is the practice.Your article (""Bad Taste"" March 31) ridicules our efforts in exporting fresh fruits and vegetables. On the contrary, Air-India should be congratulated for not cutting its freight rates since now there will be more going round for the common man at reasonable prices.D.B.N. Murthy"
107,'Alcohol has ruined my life',[],2014-01-27 16:20:01,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"Maben: back from the brink Maben: back from the brink
49, a machine operator in a Bangalore factory, began drinking heavily 15 years ago after he was superseded at work and his youngest son, Dinakar, died the same year. Maben recalls: ""At work I had no peace and at home I was unhappy. Booze was the only way I could forget my sorrows."" Instead it brought him more.
Maben became a chronic alcoholic and began sleeping with a bottle under his pillow. He started absenting himself from work regularly. His increments and promotions were stopped.
With liquor burning up all his money, Maben was invariably broke. His favourite clarinet, guitar and camera found their way to the local pawn shop, as did his wife Evelyn's jewellery, including her mangalsutra. The worst came when he was evicted from his rented two-bedroom house. Arun, his son, remembers that incident with a shudder and says: ""I can never forget how ashamed I was. All our furniture and clothes were lying on the footpath. I just ran to my friend's house and hid.""
Someone suggested that he send Rs 50 to St Francis Xavier's tomb in Goa, but that did not help. Nor did money sent to Tirupati Temple, or consulting a Mantravadi, who made him wear a charm around his waist and charged him Rs 1,000 for his pains. He was admitted to NIMHANS as many as 18 times for treatment, and the doctors refused to admit him any more.
Frustration and desperation drove him to drink a bottle of varnish last year, which nearly killed him. After that he vowed to give up drinking and over a period of one year, Maben's transformation has been dramatic. He has started doing yoga, which helps him sleep well. He goes to work regularly.
At home things have improved considerably, and Evelyn now goes shopping with him - something they had not done for years. Every Sunday all of them sing bhajans at a nearby spiritual centre. Daughter Chandrika says: ""There is so much peace at home now.""
Narayan, 44, a peon in a bank in Madurai is not so happy. An alcoholic for the past 10 years, Narayan was brought in a delirious state to the TTRC for treatment last month. His office had suspended him for coming drunk to work and warned him that unless he gave up drinking they would dismiss him.
While Narayan is still unable to speak coherently about his addiction, his wife Malini, who faced the brunt of his drunken bouts, has a sorry tale to narrate. She remembers that initially when Narayan drank she thought he was just trying to forget his worries. But soon he was coming home drunk every day, beating her regularly, and always in a foul mood. He threw away the food she made for him, he was nasty with the children and prevented them from studying at night. He did not give her money and pawned all her jewellery.
She was forced to take up work as domestic help to feed the children. And when her children worried her for money to see films, she told them sharply: ""Your father is taking my life out of me, now you don't start."" The office suspended Narayan several times, but Malini used to go and fall at the bank manager's feet and beg for mercy. Meanwhile Narayan became so weak that according to Malini ""he is now only eyes and stomach. I don't know how much longer he would live.""
Anand, 33, unlike Narayan who has not yet lost his job, finds his life has been completely shattered and is only now beginning to pick up the pieces. Anand has been an alcoholic for the past 13 years. Last year his wife walked out on him, taking their two children with her. Immediately after that he lost his job as a sales executive in a Delhi travel agency.
Anand, the son of an air force officer, started drinking when in his second year at college in Nagpur. Since his father was in the armed forces, drinking was considered normal. Anand found himself increasingly attending parties where liquor was served and he says: ""I used to be the first to start drinking and the last to leave. I had a tremendous capacity, and even if I had five large pegs I would never get drunk."" After graduation, his job as a sales executive offered even more opportunities to drink and, as he puts it: ""It was an ideal job for an alcoholic, became a 24-hour drinker.""
For a while he thought he could handle his liquor and he made sure that his work was not affected. When his wife, a doctor, told him to give up drinking, he said: ""I thought she was a bloody nag and I used to get the feeling that the whole world was after my blood."" Soon he became irregular at work and extremely irritable at home, hitting his wife once in anger.
That's when she left him. He was forced to give up his job because, as he says: ""I couldn't handle two careers at one time: my drinking and my job."" Last year he touched rock bottom:' 'I had become like a caged tiger. I didn't know how to escape and all I did was hide myself in the bottle."" He finally joined an Alcoholics Anonymous group in Delhi, and now he says: ""My obsession is gone. But I'm not going to take up a job till I'm fully recovered.""
David: groping for help David: groping for help
32, a packer in a Bombay firm, has had equally traumatic experiences with alcohol. Living in a dirty slum in Ghatkopar, David, who looks older than his age, is slowly recovering from the damaging effects of alcohol. His speech is still slurred and he gropes for words. His hands tremble uncontrollably. Doctors attending on him say his brain has suffered some damage and it may be a year before he is able to recover.David, who is married and has two children, remembers that he started drinking when he was around 15 years old: ""At that time we drank because after a hard day's work we had nothing to do and we wanted to forget the strain of living."" Initially he drank only on week-ends, but: ""After some time all I did was to drink, drink and sleep.''
He refused to go to work, and last year was absent for 140 days. His office sent him a charge-sheet, which he ignored. His entire pay packet of Rs 1,000 went towards liquor:' 'I used to be so desperate that I even sold my shoes and shirt."" His wife left him twice to go and live with her father.
David was admitted last month to the KEM Hospital for severe withdrawal symptoms of alcohol like hallucinations and shakes. Says David: ""Alcohol has ruined my life."""

When Shanthi Ranganathan, a Madras housewife, decided to set up an exclusive centre for the treatment and rehabilitation of alcoholics five years ago, many people dismissed her efforts as the desperate actions of a grief-stricken wife. Her husband, an industrialist, had just died from alcoholism and Shanthi recalls: ""People thought I was crazy. They could not accept that alcoholism could be cured, and doctors warned me that it was a disease of only relapses and remissions."" But Shanthi was determined. She did a course in the US on the treatment of alcoholics and started a centre in her sprawling home on the quiet Santhome High Road in Madras.Today the T.T. Ranganathan Clinical Research Centre (TTRC) has grown into an institute of national repute and is the only one of its kind for treating alcoholics. Given the excellent cure rate of almost 60 per cent, the annual inflow of patients has gone up from 62 in 1981 to 320 last year.Before the centre was established, there were hardly any treatment facilities for the country's three million alcoholics, most of whom were admitted to the general wards of hospitals and treated for symptoms like jaundice or hallucinations. The centre's success lies in the fact that it offers treatment for the basic problem of alcoholism. It first admits patients to a nursing home for withdrawal symptoms like hallucinations, vomiting and severe shakes.Once the ""detoxification programme"" is over, patients undergo intensive individual and group therapy sessions. Surprisingly, most patients blame their problems on others. A bank manager undergoing treatment blamed his son who dropped out of college as the reason for his heavy drinking.The group therapy sessions help patients to confront their problems head on. In these sessions, recovering alcoholics narrate their problems, providing hope and making it easy for new patients to identify with them. Says psychologist Christina Chakravarthy: ""Group therapy helps in assuaging their guilt and releases their bottled-up feelings."" The patient is able to admit both to himself and others that he is an alcoholic.But to ensure that he does not yield to fresh temptation, the patient is put on a drug called Antabuse which causes a violent reaction if he consumes alcohol while on the course. The reactions could even result in death unless an antidote is administered within 24 hours.However, getting an alcoholic to admit that he is one and keeping him off liquor for a month is, as psychiatrist J.V. Devar puts it, ""only half the battle won"". The more difficult part is rehabilitating him so that he can start living a normal life. Most alcoholics have snapped ties with their family and friends and have probably lost their jobs too. One of the major hurdles psychiatrists face is in getting the family to be more understanding towards recovering alcoholics. This is easier said than done as the wife of a salesman-turned-alcoholic narrates. Her husband found that he hardly had any role to play at home because she did all the work and the children held back from him. To overcome these problems, the centre holds regular family counselling sessions where the families are taught how to cope with recovering alcoholics.While centres like TTRC may be difficult to replicate in the country, elsewhere, hospitals which have set up de-addiction clinics (and there are very few) have also been reporting encouraging results. One of them is the de-addiction centre run by the KEM Hospital in Bombay. Using a judicious combination of group therapy, individual counselling and an Antabuse course, the clinic reports that in the past two years it has been able to achieve a cure rate of 46 per cent. And in Bangalore, NIMHANS psychologists using aversion have reported an encouraging 45 per cent cure rate. Says psychologist V. Kumaraiah: ""We found that married people responded to treatment better than the rest, and the recovery rate was the highest among the older groups.But probably one of the most successful ways of treating addicts is the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) programme which is fast gaining popularity in the country. AA is a non-profit world-wide organisation of recovered alcoholics trying to help others in the same plight. There are already 100 such groups in the country, with Bombay alone boasting 55. Other cities with AA groups are Bangalore, Goa, Madras, Secunderabad, New Delhi, Cochin, Mangalore, Nagpur, Pune and Mysore.
AA members find that the group sessions help alcoholics to come to terms with their problems. In fact the first step for all AA members is to admit that ""we were powerless over alcohol, that our lives had become unmanageable"". The sessions also help other recovering alcoholics by constantly reminding them of their earlier plight. Said an a a member: ""By trying to help others we are actually motivating ourselves to keep away from liquor.""
For the families of alcoholics, the AA has a separate group called Al-Anon where members hold similar group therapy sessions. Rather than impose a set period of abstinence, the AA's golden rule for its members is: Get up every morning and tell yourself that you will remain sober for the next 24 hours. It seems to work."
109,Alcoholism: The growing malaise,[],2014-01-27 15:52:09,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"Pour yourself your favourite drink. Sit down, loosen your shoe laces and relax. Take a large swig. Feel the warmth flow into your system. Let the surge of confidence envelope you. Then answer these questions:
Do you prefer to drink alone?
Do you drink daily? Does drinking spoil your sleep?
Do you drink to bolster your confidence?
Is drinking affecting your work?
Is your family affected by it?
Have you ever had a black-out?
If you have answered yes to any three of these questions then it's bad news. You are either an alcoholic or well on your way to becoming one. Worried? Then push your glass firmly away and listen. You are not the only one.
A tidal wave of alcoholism is engulfing the country. While in the sixties one in 300 drinkers were alcoholics now become addicts.
At exactly 7 p.m. every Saturday in the annexe building of a church on the busy Parliament Street in New Delhi, 20-odd people sit around a hexagonal table lit by candles.
Among them are salesmen, businessmen, armed forces officers, government officials, factory workers and even a doctor. As the meeting progresses each one narrates how alcohol has destroyed his life. Choking with emotion, Mathew, a copy-writer in an advertising agency, says: ""After a drunken bout I was like an animal. I messed my pants, vomited on the floor and crawled on the floor, unable to pick myself up.""
A tremendous feeling of empathy builds as the session ends, because each understands the others' sorrows, and many of those present weep openly. The meeting is typical of those held regularly across the country by 100 such Alcoholics Anonymous groups, a rapidly growing organisation of ex-drinkers trying to reform addicts.
A different kind of scene is being enacted in a white-tiled room at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore. Krishnappa, a 38-year-old coffee planter, has his left arm strapped to a 40-volt transformer and is given a glass of whisky. As soon as he takes a sip he is given a mild shock that makes him grimace in pain. This aversion therapy is designed to make Krishnappa's psyche reject alcohol. Krishnappa started drinking when he was 16 and today he does little other than drink. His disgusted wife brought him for treatment last month.
Police test driver for drinking: Police test driver for drinking:
In more homely surroundings inside a sprawling house in Madras, Swaminathan, a 55-year-old former bank manager, struggles with a picture puzzle given to him by psychologists at the T.T. Ranganathan Clinical Research Centre (TTRC) in Madras. The puzzle is designed to test how badly Swaminathan's brain has been damaged by alcohol. Swaminathan never drank when he was young, and was introduced to liquor after he was promoted as regional manager in the bank and forced to attend 'wet' parties. Soon he was hooked. At home he became irritable and constantly abused his wife, throwing the food she served and breaking crockery. His drinking affected his son so badly that he dropped out of college.Mathew, Krishnappa and Swaminathan are only the froth on a tidal wave of alcoholism engulfing the country. And there is a cask-full of statistics to prove the point. In the '60s only one in 300 drinkers was considered an alcoholic. Then the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported that by 1980 an estimated three million - or one in 25 - of the 80 million Indians who consume alcohol had become severely addicted.Last year the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) surveyed the problem in four regions - Bangalore, Delhi. Dibrugarh and Ranchi. lt found that 20 per cent of urban consumers had become totally dependent on it, while in villages the figure went as high as 30 to 40 per cent. Davinder Mohan, who coordinated the ICMR survey and heads the Department of Psychiatry at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi, says: ""Alcohol is already taking a heavy toll in the country. It's soon going to be evident even to a blind person.""The toll, in fact, has already become starkly evident: In major hospitals alcoholics now form 20 to 30 per cent of the patients in psychiatric wards when five years ago they constituted only 0.2 per cent. In Bombay's KEM Hospital, which treated 309 patients in the past two years, sociologist Hema Shah says: ""Initially we got people only from the slum areas. But soon bank officers, managers, factory workers and even government officers started coming for treatment. The middle class too seems to be affected in a big way.""

Last year's ICMR study indicated that half the industrial workers surveyed drink regularly, and companies report that alcoholism has become one of the major causes of absenteeism and falling productivity. At Ashok Leyland in Madras, for instance, managers estimate that atleast 500 of the company's 7,500 workers are problem drinkers. Says Executive Director J. Joseph: ""We used to have 10 per cent absenteeism, but now we find it going up to 22 per cent and we think alcoholism has a great deal to do with it.""Alcohol is a major cause of broken marriages. Relationships with wives were seriously disrupted in 64 per cent of the alcoholics. In Bombay, Bagashri Parikh, a marriage counsellor at the city court, says that one out of 10 divorces is because of alcoholic husbands and adds:' 'Most of the alcoholics beat their wives regularly.""The country's road research institutes estimate that 25 per cent of road accidents are alcohol-related and that a third of the drivers on the highway are under the influence of alcohol. In Delhi, when the AIIMS did a study of accident victims suffering from head injuries, it found that 20 per cent had consumed alcohol.Surveying the damage Hira Singh, director. National Institute of Social Defence (NISD), the Union Welfare Ministry's striking arm against drug abuse, says: ' 'There is no doubt that alcohol is the most widely abused drug in the country."" That's certainly true. Alcoholism has traditionally been associated with the tribal areas in the country, where people brew their own liquor.
Then the problem spread to the hilly areas and the northeast, and to industrial townships and the coalfields. Now other areas too have got ensnared, hitting people from all walks of life: professionals, businessmen, industrial workers, government servants, armed forces officers and farmers.
The statistics reveal that most of the patients (98 per cent) are predominantly male, and usually in the prime of their lives at 25 years and above. A majority are married and have children. In most cases they are the only bread-winners in the family. ""It's hitting the most productive section of our society and is creating havoc,"" says psychiatrist J.V. Devar in Madras.
Researchers are hard put to explain the dramatic rise in alcoholism in a country that has prohibition enshrined as a Directive Principle of the Constitution. But prohibition as a policy has been steadily given up by one state after another, and liquor is now as easily available as tea leaves in most parts of the country. Alcohol consumption, inevitably, has gone up quite dramatically. In 1976, liquor manufacturers used up 169.4 million litres of pure alcohol, enough to manufacture 350 million bottles of rum.
Alcoholics Anonymous meeting Alcoholics Anonymous meeting
But despite tough measures by the puritanical Janata government and the Congress(I)'s resolve to hold production at the 1981 level of 207.9 million litres, the consumption of pure alcohol climbed to 331 million litres last year - sufficient to produce 1,134 million bottles of rum!Indians now have more than 200 brands of whisky, 50 brands of rum, 30 kinds of brandy, 10 brands of gin, 15 of wine, 50 beers and a couple of hundred varieties of country liquor to choose from. ""People have become more brand conscious and are willing to pay more for better quality liquor these days,"" says Ravi Jain, general manager of McDowells, a subsidiary of United Breweries, which is among the big five in the liquor business. McDowells has registered a 10 per cent growth every year.That Indians are drinking more than ever before is evident by their revolutionary change in attitudes towards drinking. The traditional taboo against liquor is rapidly vanishing. More and more homes serve liquor to guests, 'dry' parties are considered boring, and traditional festivals like Ganesh Chaturthi, Diwali and Holi are used as excuses to go on drinking bouts.
Salesmen and businessmen prefer to do business over lunch lined with liquor. Among youngsters, to drink is to be manly. ""We are becoming more of an alcoholised society,"" says psychiatrist Rajat Ray of NIMHANS. And in Lucknow, psychiatrist B.B. Sethi says: ""A house not serving liquor is now an exception.""
Drinking in bars, once the haunt of only the hardened alcoholic, has gained increasing acceptance. In the outskirts of Patna. for instance, roadside bhattis, the poor man's bars, have become popular drinking places. One of them on the bypass road to Patna is a huge, sprawling dimly-lit shack reeking with the stench of liquor, rotten fish and frying eggs. Around 250 people, among them teenagers, sit around in groups chatting and shouting. They come from all social groups - rickshaw-pullers, factory workers, professionals and even police constables in civilian dress. Babu Lalrai, 35, a tailor, chirps up:' 'Yes, I drink daily and go to the Ganga for a holy dip daily.""
The wave of alcoholism is by no means confined to the cities. While the sale of country liquor in most states has risen slowly, this masks the fact that people have increasingly moved to cheaper, illicit liquor because even country liquor costs as much as Rs 8 for a bottle. In Bangalore, arrack king H.R. Basavaraj estimates that ""illicit liquor sales equal that of country liquor"". The repetitive liquor tragedies testify to this. In Bangalore more than 300 people died of liquor poisoning in 1981. The next year in the island of Vypeen in Kerala, 72 people were killed. On an average more than 200 people are killed in the country from liquor poisoning every year.
Youngsters drinking: vulnerable age Youngsters drinking: vulnerable age
What worries many psychiatrists is the widespread acceptance of beer and the current boom in beer sales. In Maharashtra, beer sales have jumped from 14 million bottles to 24 million bottles in the last five years. And in West Bengal, more beer is consumed than whisky, rum and brandy put together; last year's beer sales totalled 12 million bottles.
But if people regard beer as some kind of milk product, the harsh truth is that one bottle of beer has about the same alcohol content as a peg of whisky, and psychiatrists say that beer drinking not only opens the floodgates for more potent liquor but is addictive and in the long run can do as much damage as whisky or rum.
The splurge in drinking is reflected in the high per capita consumption of liquor. While the annual per capita consumption of alcohol by adults in India hovers around one litre of pure alcohol (equivalent to two-and-a-half bottles of rum), a little lower than Australia's 1.5 and a lot less than the US's 4.1, this figure is misleading. Unlike Australia and the US, women in India hardly drink.
So if only the male population's consumption is calculated, the figure jumps to around two litres of pure alcohol. And if only the drinking male population is taken into account, the figure is as high as 4.1, or 10 bottles of rum per head annually: high enough for the alarm bells to be ringing. Even this excludes the millions of litres of illicit liquor that goes down parched gullets. And in states like Punjab, the per capita consumption is 6.5 litres of pure alcohol, or 16 bottles of rum.
All drinkers are not drunkards. So when does a normal drinker turn alcoholic? The popular concept of the drunk is one who falls into gutters or staggers around on streets mouthing obscenities. But that, say psychiatrists, is only the last stages of alcoholism. A social drinker becomes a problem one when, according to Shanthi Ranganathan of TTRC: ""His drinking starts affecting on a continuous basis his health, his job efficiency and his relations with his family and friends."" The who estimates that one out of 10 drinkers turns alcoholic.
Most drinkers do not realise when they have crossed the thin red line between social drinking and alcoholism. In Madras, Udayakumar, 37, a former packing manufacturer, thought he had his drinking well under control till one day he realised that ""a quarter of a bottle of rum was a mosquito bite"". In Bangalore, a salesman remembers that while initially he could hardly hold a peg of whisky he suddenly found himself going on long drinking bouts.
Says he: ""Every cell in my body craved for alcohol and when I took a drink it was like setting off a nuclear reaction. I didn't stop drinking till I became unconscious."" And in Bombay, a factory supervisor initially started drinking during week-ends with friends. Then, as he says, ""after a while I drank once in three days, then every alternate day, then every day and then every hour"".
Researchers now agree that alcoholism is a disease, because alcoholics exhibit predictable symptoms and suffer the same physical and mental trauma: severe shakes, damage to vital organs like the heart and liver, and psychological breakdown. Society, which always dismissed alcoholics as weak-willed or immoral people, is only now reluctantly beginning to accept this home truth.
In Bangalore, Malavika, a 30-year-old management consultant married to a lawyer, confesses: ""I thought all drunkards were bums till my husband became an alcoholic. Initially I was bewildered and thought he drank because he was not happy with me. But I soon realised that although he desperately wanted to give up alcohol he couldn't. It was as though he had caught a disease.""
Once the disease catches on it moves with terrifying rapidity, reducing its victims to physical, mental and moral wrecks. Try as they will, they find it impossible to kick the habit even though they know that it is steadily destroying their lives. A Bombay naval officer remembers with tears how he tied his favourite Labrador and whipped it mercilessly in a drunken fit.
The next morning the dog seemed to forget the beating and wagged its tail, but he was so insane that he whipped it again. Mathew, the Delhi copy-writer, remembers how he threw up a Rs 5,000 job in a leading advertising agency when he quarrelled with his employer over a trivial matter.
Probably the most damaging effect of this wave of alcoholism, according to a doctor, is that ""not only the drinker but everyone in the family suffers. Alcoholism is a family disease."" As the alcoholic becomes more and more obnoxious, the wife and children get seriously affected. Malavika, the lawyer's wife, recalls the traumatic experience when guests dropped in one morning and found her husband lying on the floor dead drunk.
The naval commander's wife once tried to jump out of a fourth floor window after he slapped her in a drunken rage. Children too are badly affected. In a typical case in Bangalore, Arun, 17, whose father has been a chronic alcoholic, dropped out of school and took to drugs and alcohol. In fact studies abroad indicate that alcoholism could also be a familial disease, with children of alcoholics being more prone to becoming alcoholics themselves.
If more families have not broken up, it is because most Indian wives fear the stigma attached to divorce. Last fortnight Malathi, 38, the wife of a former supervisor in a printing press and mother of five children, came to social workers at the Maharashtra State Women's Council for help. Her husband had beaten her so badly that her cheek and shoulder were blue-black.
She said her husband had lost his job because of his drinking, and when she wanted to take up a job her husband refused to allow her and suspected her fidelity. Her eldest son had become a vagrant and a petty thief. But when the council suggested she divorce her husband. she flatly refused. Says the council's social worker Anila Merchant: ""For most sufferers marriage provides some form of security.""
A just-published study of workers at the Madras Port Trust, done by sociologist Saraswathi Sankaran, shows how damaging alcohol can be. Of the 162 workers surveyed, more than half of them drank heavily, and a third were addicts.
Sankaran compared the work performance of the drinkers and non-drinkers and was stunned to find that the heavy drinkers were absent every sixth working day. As a result, the non-drinkers took home 50 per cent more money than the drinkers, spent8 per cent more on food, 30 per cent more on clothing, 168 per cent more on health care and a whopping 300 per cent more on children's education. Says Sankaran: ""Whether it is poverty, malnutrition, marital disharmony or delinquent children, alcohol seems to have been the major cause of all their miseries.'' While alcoholism and its related problems increase alarmingly, progress on the treatment of sufferers has been tardy.
Most alcoholics find that doctors treat the problem as a moral issue. Said one alcoholic: ""My whole world had crumbled, and here was this doctor telling me I must develop the will power to stop drinking."" Only now are hospitals recognising alcoholism as a major problem and setting up specialised clinics for treatment (see box). As a consequence, there are facilities for treating hardly 3,000 of the estimated three million alcoholics in the country.
But even hospitals that have clinics are faced with problems like the lack of professionally trained staff.
The problem is compounded by the fact that most alcoholics do not get themselves treated till at a very late stage, because most people do not like to admit they have an alcoholic in their family and try to conceal the fact as long as possible. A factory supervisor in Bombay, who had been an alcoholic for five years, first tried to give up drinking himself.
When that failed his wife sent him to the local mantravadi to exorcise the spirit that seemed to have possessed him. It was only when he was admitted to the KEM Hospital with an attack of jaundice that he learnt the hospital had a de-addiction programme. Infact, most of the patients usually go to hospital when they have serious health problems such as cirrhosis of the liver or fits of delirium.
If the psychiatrists find it difficult to cope with the problem, the Government seems equally helpless. The state governments, which control alcohol supply and distribution, indirectly encourage people to drink more because revenue from excise forms a major part of the income of most states. In Karnataka liquor is the second biggest money-spinner for the state, netting Rs 50 crore last year, while in Tamil Nadu it accounts for a good 8 per cent of the revenue. Total liquor sales in the country would amount to something like Rs 3,000 crore, and liquor companies form a powerful lobby group.
Ironically, although the Constitution has made prohibition a Directive Principle, the states have made only feeble attempts to make prohibition effective policy. Most governments in fact have given up prohibition altogether. Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, which had imposed prohibition at different times, ran into trouble and were forced to relax their rules.
Tamil Nadu needed the excise revenue to run its midday meal scheme. Maharashtra, which strangely enough has placed prohibition and excise under the same department, is quite happy counting the take from liquor sales while running a prohibition programme to educate people on the evils of drinking. Bihar was forced to lift prohibition after a large number of people died in of illicit liquor in the Dhanbad coalfields. Right now Gujarat is the only state where prohibition is enforced, but liquor is still easily available and the policy is commonly seen as a farce.
Wiser from these experiences. many states have set up temperance boards in the fond hope that if they cannot prevent people from drinking they can convince them to drink moderately. But most of these boards do little more than release advertisements in newspapers showing a bottle marked with the familiar skull and crossbones.
With governments unable to curb the menace, people have taken matters into their own hands. In distant Imphal in Manipur, women were so disgusted with their men folk's excessive drinking that they formed themselves into an association against drunkards and kept vigil at nights in front of liquor shops and bars. Any drunkard they catch is publicly humiliated by making him walk with a string of bottles tied around his neck, and then handed over to the police. In the hills of Uttar Pradesh and tribal areas of Bihar similar people's movements have met with notable success in an area where drunkenness has become a major social problem.
Mean while, to formulate fresh strategies against drinking and drug abuse, the Welfare Ministry two years ago set up a working group chaired by its joint secretary. This is likely to stress education programmes on the evils of drinking. As Rajendra Kumari Bajpai, minister of state for welfare says: ""A stroke of the pen, like imposing a total ban, is not going to help. If we have to bring alcoholism under control we need to use persuasion, create awareness and show a strong determination to implement our programmes.""
But with both the Central and state governments failing to make a serious dent in the two vital factors that the who says leads to an increase in alcoholism - easy availability and increasing demand for alcohol - the battle of the bottle may be well and truly lost."
110,Chandigarh: The house of horror,[],2014-01-08 11:49:33,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"Datla's body in his room: macabre events Datla's body in his room: macabre events
From the outside, the palatial, pink-washed house in Chandigarh's Sector 8 looked no different from its neighbours. But inside, was a world even more macabre than a Stephen King horror story.
The body of a man dead for the last two years. A family whose blind faith caused them to believe he was still alive. A tantrik who succeeded in fuelling that faith, and has now been charged with the man's murder. It was a world of shadows and superstition and only last week was the outside world allowed a glimpse into the bizarre happenings at the Datta household.
Thick pink curtains kept out the sunlight and prying eyes in the sprawling drawing-room in which the family clung to each other, and its faith. A strange cloying smell - death mingled with incense - hung over everything. The dead man's wife, Kamlesh Datta, surrounded by her five children, spoke as if she were in a kind of trance and seemed unable to answer questions that were not related to the 22 months she had lived believing her husband to be alive.
The day before, her husband's body had been forcibly taken away by the police and cremated. But nobody mourned, nobody grieved and nobody had lost faith. ""He was alive. I know that. I felt his pulse and his heartbeat. I was with him every night. I know. They took him away without asking for my permission,"" says Kamlesh.
The children recalled how they used to come back from school or college in the evenings and sit and talk to their father about what had happened. The eldest, Mohita, 20, said: ""He seemed to listen, although he never responded, and we believed that he was alive."" The same view was shared by Datta's mother. Shanti Devi, who said the Government had no right to interfere.
But in the pink drawing-room, there were some non-believers too and prominent among them was Kamlesh's mother, Bimla Devi, who shrieked at her daughter and grandchildren every time they said anything about the guru. Amir Chand Kaushal, who had convinced them that Datta was alive. ""This man has destroyed our family. He knew that my son-in-law was dead. He told me this himself. I don't know what he has done to my daughter, who was so intelligent, so educated. He has destroyed these children,"" she said.
The bizarre story of the death and after life of Shri Ram Datta, assistant conservator of forests in Himachal Pradesh, began on June 18, 1985. Datta had come to Chandigarh to visit his wife and children who were staying with a former colleague and close friend, Baldev Singh and his wife Daljit Kaur. Daljit had become 'pregnant' after several miscarriages at the age of 45 and needed someone to run the house.
Since she kept poor health so the Dattas moved in. Datta had also developed a painful boil on the back of his neck and had done nothing to treat it. He had been, for nearly two years, under the spiritual influence of guru Amir Chand Kaushal and had foresworn all medication, putting his faith instead in the power of the guru to cure anything. Kaushal's believers are not allowed to touch any medicine.
Kaushal, Baldev and Daljit being arrested Kaushal, Baldev and Daljit being arrested
The boil, however, refused to heal and that night (June 18, 1985) he collapsed into what appeared to be a coma. Said Kamlesh: ""He stopped breathing and there was no pulse. So I telephoned guruji and he said have faith in god and all will be well."" Baldev says that he thought at first that Datta was dead. The boil had caused his back to swell and tauten so that all his veins seemed to be sticking out.
According to Kamlesh, her husband's skin then turned black in the next few days and swellings came up all over the body. After that, what she describes as 'blood', but what doctors feel was fluid flowed out of Datta's body for three or four days. Then, she says, the skin returned to its normal colour and there were few changes for the next two years, other than the lengthening of his hair and nails.
Life in the house in Sector 8 continued pretty much as normal with Datta lying 'sick' in his bedroom adjoining the large drawing-room. Twice a day his wife would sponge him with water and at night she and the children slept in the same room as him without once feeling that he was dead. Although Datta did not seem to be getting any better he did not seem to get any worse either and their guru continued to reassure them that all would be well one day.
Now the guru, in an interview after his arrest last week for murder, claims that he knew the truth but could not destroy the family's faith. Says Kaushal: ""I never examined him closely. It was Mrs Datta who told me that she could still feel his pulse and his heartbeat and I just couldn't shatter their faith."" Apart from the guru, Kaushal, Chandigarh police have also arrested Baldev Singh and Daljit Kaur on charges of murder and conspiracy to murder on a complaint filed by Datta's brother, Anil.
Kaushal's followers, however, believe that their guru was capable of bringing Datta back to life. The followers, who requested anonymity, claim that Kaushal has cured over a thousand victims of the Bhopal gas tragedy and that he has submitted a list of 160 people whom he has cured of fatal diseases.
It was Kaushal's alleged healing powers that first drew Baldev and Daljit, who has been miraculously 'pregnant' now for 64 months, into Kaushal's innermost circle. Singh claims that his alcoholism was cured instantly when he met Kaushal eight years ago and so was a disease of the lungs, which doctors said would kill him in six months.
Then, there is his wife, who has also been charged with murder. When she became 'pregnant' and there were no signs of a baby after nine months. Kaushal told her that her husband would have to gain control over his temper for the baby to be born. Further, the baby would only come when his mission was complete and that this would be the day when Datta would also be cured.
Interviewed on the day she was due to be produced in court, she said wearily: ""I don't know anything any more. Everything has gone wrong. Guruji used to say I didn't have enough faith. For my part, I have done all I could. Now it is up to god.''
The man at the centre of this macabre nightmare looks more like an overweight attendant in a ration shop than a spiritualist or a healer. By profession, Kaushal is a schoolteacher, who till two years ago taught English and Social Studies at a school just outside Chandigarh. The cult that he created centres around the belief that one should not believe in any religion.
He denies being a tantrik but admits that he performed moonlit ceremonies in which hundreds of candles would be lit (""just for decoration"") and prayers would be chanted to the parmatama (god). His followers obey his every word, as if they were under some form of hypnosis. According to Baldev, the inner circle consists of only about 50 people but there are thousands of other followers, mainly the rich and the powerful.
The authorities only discovered the Datta case on May 1 when Deputy Superintendent of Police Desraj Sharma arrived at the house to enquire into the health of Datta, who had been absent from work on the basis of a series of leave applications submitted regularly by his wife. He reported what he had seen but the police took nearly six days to finally remove Datta's body.
Family around the empty bed: blind faith Family around the empty bed: blind faith
When a team of doctors from Chandigarh's Post-Graduate Institute examined Datta's remains they found that a process of 'natural mummification' had taken place. All his organs were intact inside his body but they had shrivelled and dried up. According to a senior doctor involved in the post-mortem examination: ""There is nothing miraculous about what happened. Such cases have been recorded in medical science, although they are extremely rare. We think this could have happened because he died in June when the weather is hot and dry and lends itself to mummification.""When asked to comment on the family's contention that his hair and nails grew and that his pulse could be felt, he said it was virtually impossible for laymen to distinguish a pulse that was faint and there was no question of nails growing, but hair could have grown when the skin shrank. It was not possible to ascertain what had actually caused Datta's death but doctors believe that the pus that had collected in the boil could have spread through the body and killed him.
He could have been saved had he been given proper medical aid. So what remains to be decided, in what could turn into as bizarre a legal case as it is a medical one, is whether guru Kaushal and his friends did indirectly cause Datta's death."

Or, your chances of developing heart disease? It is easy; just 10 ml of your spittle sent to the nearest genetic test centre can reveal your entire DNA make- up and the health conditions awaiting you. Wouldn't you just want to know?The field of genomics ( study of genomes) is picking up in the country after an almost 6 year stint in the West. The idea of getting one's health horoscope has indeed caught up with many.With increased levels of health consciousness, many of us are indeed in anticipation of what lies ahead. And if we could prevent it, what better than that? Cashing in on preventive care, an increasing number of private companies are offering to read people's DNA and provide insight on their health. Genetic profile of each person varies and it can help find if you are predisposed to cancer, obesity, diabetes, or any other medical condition."" It is typical in India to attend to health only when we start seeing symptoms as opposed to being preventive. In fact health checks have gained attention only over the last decade. And believe it or not, this can be a life saving decision.Genomic testing is now finding importance in both primary as well as secondary and tertiary care,"" says Saleem Mohammed, CEO and Co- Founder, X- Code Life Sciences, Chennai. Once your DNA is decoded, genetic counselors and nutritional experts come to your aid to help prevent problems.If you believe knowledge is power, it is time to embrace these genetic tests, say experts.There are two types of genetic risks that are calculated - some are single gene ones and others are multiple genes ones. Single gene ones are relatively easier to check. Most diseases however, have multiple genes making risk assessment harder."" Genetics is only a portion of the risk as environment and epigenetics also matter a lot for a disorder to really express. Genetic testing won't prevent it, a lifestyle intervention is likely to,"" says Anuradha Acharya, CEO of Mapmygenome, Hyderabad."" Most of the ailments like heart disease and diabetes can be retarded in their tracks by suitable lifestyle measures. For example, smoking and alcohol activate the genes for heart diseases in those who are susceptible.So the advice given to them is to stay off both. Considering the expense of treatments and the fact that some conditions might be irreversible, people prefer to opt for a preventive approach,"" says Dr B R Das, president, research and innovation, SRL Diagnostics. It all comes down to lifestyle changes."" It depends on their family health background and also their current lifestyle and the risk for particular diseases. In most cases, there would be specific suggestions given for better diet and exercise but these are customised based on their current status,"" says Anuradha.In November last year, the US Food and Drugs Administration banned the personal genomic firm23andme from sending out any more of its saliva tests until it could provide evidence that they were accurate. Back in India, the field is still in its nascent stage but the players seem to promise both privacy and accuracy."" It is extremely important to ensure that the DNA for an individual is protected. We double anonymize the samples and take consent to use de- identified samples for research use,"" states Anuradha. When it comes to DNA make- up, Indians are more similar to Caucasians compared to Asians, adds Saleem.Can you imagine visiting the doctor with your genetic pool information in the disk? This wave of personalised medicine is bound to be a great add- on to conventional medicine, feel experts. "" While genomics may not be the coolest thing in healthcare in 2050, most of healthcare would be based on genomics. There are hundreds of diagnostics tests in the pipeline.The industry has grown. While in 2001, it cost $ 100 million to sequence a human genome, now the cost has come down to $ 5000,"" says Anuradha. For now, the aim is to go about accurate predictions for these gene testing centres."" For long term effect, ICMR should give priority focus to genomics; failing which India will not only lag behind but may never be able to catch up in the field,"" points out Saleem."
112,Here's the man who invented tuna pizza,[],2013-12-19 08:27:47,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201312/column-1-3_650_121913081236.jpg,"A couple of months back, Ankur Chawla, ex-Taj staffer and author of 14 Hours, a gripping first-person account of the 26/11 terror attacks, was remembering Masaharu Morimoto from the preopening days of Wasabi, the Japanese-American chef's signature restaurant at the Taj Mahal Hotel in New Delhi. Chawla said he was taken by surprise to see an internationally renowned chef with a ponytail moving around anonymously in a Tshirt, shorts and sneakers.So, you can imagine my surprise when I sat down to interview Morimoto, looking just the way Chawla had described him, shielded by a neat pile of tempting petit fours on the layered dish that hoteliers call a 'charlie'. I started by asking him if he remembered his 'acolyte' Akira Back, the Korean-American who has just opened his eponymous restaurant at the J.W. Marriott in the Aerocity, and that was enough to draw the normally reserved chef into an animated conversation.He said he had not seen Akira Back till he went to dine at his restaurant Yellowtail in Las Vegas and that the chef-restaurateur who insists he's Morimoto's protege is not the inventor of the tuna pizza. Of course, he said with an impish smile, he did not mind being flattered by imitators.""I am not a celebrity, but the media has made me into one,"" Morimoto declared, adding that now it seemed all he had to do was ""just talk, talk, talk"". Well, he shouldn't be complaining about being a celebrity, for he owes his worldwide fame to the Fuji TV reality show, Iron Chef, and its U.S. spinoff, Iron Chef America.A shoulder injury had made Morimoto opt out of Major League baseball and start training as a sushi and kaiseki (Japanese haute cuisine) chef, before he got to own a restaurant in Hiroshima. He first wanted to go to America, to cash in on what he now calls the ""sushi boom"", during the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984. He had to postpone his plan by a year because he took that long to find a buyer for his restaurant.When he finally left for the U.S. in 1985, he had with him ""the cheapest"" roundtrip ticket and his flight from Hiroshima to New York had three stopovers -Osaka, Seoul and Anchorage.He had booked a roundtrip ticket because he was certain he would have to go back home, but he never got to use it for the return flight. After working at different restaurants in his adopted city, the as-yet-unknown chef took charge of the Japanese kitchen at the Sony Club, which was the private dining room of top directors of the Sony Corporation, and was hired by Nobu Matsuhisa, the man who's synonymous with modern Japanese cuisine, to open the first Nobu in New York as executive chef in 1994.Having worked and trained under the master, Morimoto launched his own restaurant in Philadelphia in 2001. It became as famous for its Japanese cuisine with western touches as for its exuberant decor. ""Food is only 30 per cent,"" Morimoto said to me, underlining the salience of ""design, decor, music, atmosphere,"" and then quickly added the caveat: ""But it is my 100 per cent. I can't control your mood, but I can make the taste of my food change it.""Since 2001, awards, accolades and new restaurant openings have been Morimoto's constant companions. Morimoto opened Wasabi at the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower in Mumbai when it was still early days for his restaurant empire, which now stretches from Philly to Hawaii, via Napa Valley and Tokyo, but the move worked. ""If we have been successful, it is not because we are lucky,"" he said. ""The timing of our entry may have been right, but we also have done a good job."" People who've dined at Wasabi, although the meal may have set them back substantially, would agree with the Iron Chef.Hemant Oberoi can justifiably claim to have logged more frequent flyer miles than any other Indian chef. His celebrity status dates back to the late 1990s, when he first attracted media notice with his Californian Indian (Cal-Indian) cuisine topped by the famous 'naanzza' (naan baked like a pizza with butter chicken sauce, mozzarella and tandoori chicken).Fame comes at a price - in Oberoi's case, it has meant he lives out of airports, hotels and suitcases on most days as he goes around the world serving heads of state and showcasing Indian food at international festivals. In return, the Ferozepur-born corporate chef of Taj Hotels has had the privilege of getting Bill Clinton to eat dahi vada at the Ambani residence and of inspiring the former Conservative prime minister of Great Britain, John Major, to depart from state banquet protocol and asking for a second helping.I had always wondered why Oberoi hadn't put his recipes, including those of his modernist interpretations of traditional Indian dishes, together in one book. Arvind Saraswat, another Taj veteran, did it before him, but his work, The Gourmet Indian Cookbook, where he floated the idea of fruit-based sauces, did not find many takers. Oberoi has finally taken the plunge and he unveiled The Masala Art: Indian Haute Cuisine (Roli Books) last week at the Taj Palace restaurant after which the book is named.My first take-away from the book was Oberoi's long working day. How does a man manage to look so happy and not seem to age when he reports for work at 9 a.m. and calls it a day at 11:30 p.m.. What I like about the recipes is that though they come with a twist (Beetroot Lassi, Lemongrass Rasam, Crab Samosas and Masala Chai Kulfi, for instance), and the dishes look like works of art, they are easy to follow.It is a privilege to be born with a surname revered in 165 countries and a fixture in the recipes of more than 300 cocktails. Alfred Cointreau represents the sixth generation of a drink that was born when Edouard Cointreau (not to be confused with the man who founded the Gourmand World Cookbook Awards) perfected the recipe for it in 1875. Unsurprisingly, Alfred, 26, who believes in travelling out of his home city, Angers in the Loire Valley, after every two weeks, is passionate about his official role: Cointreau Heritage Manager. He showed it on his recent visit to New Delhi, where he was a star at the popular speakeasy, PCO at Vasant Vihar.""At the beginning you have an orange peel and at the end the 'heart',"" Alfred said, describing the production process of Cointreau. The orange liqueur, or triple sec, depends entirely on what Alfred calls the ""perfect balance"" of the four ingredients - sweet and bitter peels sourced from Brazil, Ghana, Haiti and Spain, and selected by the master distiller, Bernadette Langleis; alcohol derived from beetroots; and sugar. Peels of three oranges go into each bottle of Cointreau (and 15 million of them are produced every year) and these are macerated in alcohol and water for six months before sugar is added during the distillation process. It's amazing how the world's best things have the simplest origins."

Getting drugs in the Capital is not very difficult if one is willing to spend 'some money'. Sources say Delhi is the latest 'drug destination' where all kinds of narcotics that were previously unheard of in the party circuits are available.
Many of the drugs, including LSD, meth and cocaine, were there for a long time but in recent years, ecstasy, MDMA, speed, magic mushrooms and DMT have also made their name in the market.
Rave parties, organised mainly in farmhouses of South Delhi, are the most common place to find the cocktail of all these drugs. The details of how these parties are organised and who organise them are not out in the open. These people contact each other through phones or online.
Mail Today spoke to a man who had organised one such party for his close friends. ""It is very difficult to organise a rave party, mainly because there is a risk of being caught by the police. But if you have enough money, you can easily pull it off. When I organised a party for 60 of my friends in a Mehrauli last year, I had to shell out Rs 1.7 lakh,"" he said on the condition of anonymity.
Another 20-year-old said: ""In our circuit, the party is never complete without hash and hookah. Then there are these latest happy drugs that my friends indulge in. Through contacts, I did manage to get magic mushrooms and ecstacy pills. Combine them with alcohol and you are all set for the evening.""
An officer with the narcotics department said, ""Whenever we get information that a rave party is taking place, we conduct a raid there. However, making sure that these parties do not happen at all is very difficult."""

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav suspended 10 people, including the district excise inspector Om Prakash Singh. The state government also ordered a magisterial probe into the incident.
Vishvanath Yadav, the station house officer (SHO) of Mubarakpur, where the incidents took place, was suspended along with beat sub-inspector Rajdev Yadav, constables Pradeep Kumar Yadav, Ramesh Chandra Upadhyaya, Parmanand Yadav and Banke Lal.
Most of the deceased come from lower sections and labour class, officials said.
District Magistrate, Neena Sharma said prima facie the case appeared to be related to the consumption of rectified spirit.
Officials on condition of anonymity said at many local shops, rectified spirit mixed with water was being sold unchecked and at cheap rates.
While moonshine has 42 per cent of alcohol, the rectified spirit has intensity varying between 90-95 per cent.
""This is a killer concoction,"" an official said.

Remember Shweta Katti? The 18-year-old who was living in Kamathipura, Mumbai's red light district, is now pursuing a course in Psychology at Bard University in the US. Katti lived most of her life in Kamathipura and braved sexual assaults and other discrimination to go to the US simply because NGOs like Indian Association for Promotion and Adoption of child welfare (IAPA), Kranti and many other organisations were involved in giving her the guidance like providing education, counseling and guidance and financial help.
Katti could however be the last girl at least from Mumbai to benefit simply because the BMC in its most shameless display of abuse of power has now decided to throw out more than 200 such NGOs that operate from its civic schools. So the Helen Keller Institute for Deaf and Deaf blind, IAPA and Alcoholics Anonymous all would have to vacate civic schools in the next few months. All these NGOs do not interfere in the functioning of the civic schools in Mumbai, and in fact occupy just a few classrooms that are anyway unused simply because most were anyway lying vacant. These trusts and NGO's have been working since almost the 1980's however now with space being a premium in Mumbai, the BMC however now has woken up and has decided that these NGO's are to be evicted. Officially the Civic body's reasoning is this- The NGO';s pay less rent, and the NGO' s are not engaged in the business of education. The BMC wants the class rooms because then they could set up more English medium class rooms, and in others they would hold libraries and laboratories for civic schools.
The BMC's claim is is anything but hilarious: the civic body talks of opening more English medium classrooms but, over the years, the standard of education has fallen to such an extent that parents are simply not sending their children to civic schools. In fact even parents from the lower social strata prefer to send their kids to private schools, even though the fees are high and it is a strain on their monthly budget. So while the civic body talks of upgrading the English medium schools, the fact remains that the civic body's dismal education standard has fallen to such an extent that there are many parents who are just not putting their children in civic run Marathi medium schools, forcing many of them to shut down.
Make no mistake after having these NGOs vacate these schools, the BMC is not going to open more English medium schools or labs or libraries but will be letting it out to educational institutes who charge a bomb for education children and coaching classes.
We are supposed to trust the same BMC that year after year allots the same road contractors money to build roads that don't last even till the first monsoon showers. The BMC that ignores structural changes done in a building, even though it knows that it would lead to the building collapsing and killing people residing in it.
It is clear that the NGOs and other social organisations are being evicted simply because a few in the BMC have realised that these properties could be exploited to make another fast buck. So far the many Shweta Kattis out there, tough luck, if you manage to stay in the same rut and get exploited or worse, turn into sex workers, you can blame your fate or the BMC.

Actor Ranveer Singh just got released from a hospital after suffering from dengue. The disease that is spread through mosquitoes has reached such alarming levels that more than a thousand have been affected. The BMC however claims only 615 people in the city have been affected and only six have died - basing this on figures of only those who were admitted in civic hospitals.

A sweet scam in Mumbai's mills
Social activists Anna Hazare and Medha Patkar have alleged a Rs 10,000 crore scam in the sale of sugar mills in Mumbai. Hazare and Patkar have alleged that the sugar mills, all of which were sick, were sold off for just Rs 12 crores to Rs 108 crores. While the mills were sick, there does appear to be a hint of a scam as the sugar cooperatives have hundreds of acres of land which meant that they should have been sold for a higher price.
Incidentally most of these sugar mills have been bought by politicians or controlled by them. From NCP leader and Deputy CM Ajit Pawar, PWD Minister Chagggan Bhujbal to Rural Development Minister Jayant Patil, all got the mills at a cheap rate than their actual valuation allege Hazare and co.
Interestingly the Congress, which usually gloats on allegations against the NCP, is silent because even some of its own leaders have allegedly benefited. The BJP too is silent because its former National Chief Nitin Gadkari is also an alleged beneficiary.

A day in the life of a Mumbai constable
Last week a video went viral of a model-cum-actress who was caught on camera abusing the Mumbai police and the police commissioner, all because the cops had gone to her residence asking her to lower her volume in the night as her neighbours had complained.
What was interesting in the video was the old constable who stood stone-faced without even as much as saying shut up to the belligerent girl. Many felt sorry for the constable, who kept all his anger on check because there was a woman in front of him. Since they could not detain the girl without a lady constable, the model kept on abusing and humiliating the constable who stood like the Buddha.
While the Mumbai police are a much maligned lot, the above incident illustrates the challenges that the lower rung of the police - derogatorily called 'pandus' - have to face almost daily. Most of the life of a constable in Mumbai is spent either in the police station or on bandobast duty. He is seldom at home, all his Dusseheras, Diwalis and New years are spent ensuring that people do not drunken drive, kill people or molest women.
In fact since they are severely short staffed the constables many times end up working for more than 30 hours non stop. In spite of all of this if there is a untoward incident in their jurisdiction then these constables and their seniors like Inspectors and Senior Inspectors get abused by their superiors, not unlike the treatment meted out by the model."
117,"Issue Date: Feb 28, 1991",[],2013-09-24 16:44:13,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"The moment her exam results came out, Sujata, a Bombay school girl, became introspective and withdrew into a shell. Her poor marks meant that she stood no hope of ever getting into medical college. A psychiatrist recommended electric shock treatment. Horrified at the idea, Sujata's father decided to counsel her himself.
As she responded, her family began to breathe more easily. But one day Sujata handed around over two dozen free cinema tickets to her family and relatives. She asked them to go ahead and reach the cinema. She would catch up with them later, she promised. Having ensured she was alone in the house, Sujata doused herself with kerosene and set fire to herself. She was only 16.
Although no up-to-date figures have been collected on the number of youngsters who kill themselves every year, psychiatrists are alarmed at the unmistakable trend. In 1986, 7,545 persons below the age of 18 killed themselves - 13.9 per cent of the total for that year. It's all part of the rising tide of suicides throughout the country as people struggle to cope with the endless pressures of modern existence.
Schoolchildren can find the rat race of exam results and competition too much to bear. They know the chances of happiness and prosperity are doomed without good marks. The pressure starts so early that the police come across cases of children as young as 10 or 11 committing suicide. Suicide is one of life's great enigmas. No one can say with certainty what ""type"" of person will do it, how, when or why. The friends and family of a suicide case are invariably surprised when it happens. A shroud of mystery surrounds the act. The only certitude is in the figures. Every two minutes someone in India attempts suicide. Every 10 minutes someone succeeds.
Sujata was just one of the 60,000 people who killed themselves last year. Nearly half of them were aged between 18 and 35, generally considered the best years of a person's life. The real figure, though, is much higher because many families prefer to pass off a suicide as an accident to avoid the stigma it carries.
Psychiatrists say they're confronted by a colossal challenge. While the number of suicides is shooting up, the country has only 200 psychiatrists to cope with it. Five years ago, K.E.M. Hospital in Bombay used to receive around 10 cases of suicide attempts a week. Now it's over 25. Other hospitals have noted a similar rise. Behind the cold figures lies the endless variety of human misery. The reason why a person chooses to end his or her life can be enumerated ad inflnitum: poverty, unemployment, a miserable marriage, debt, incurable disease, dowry harassment, alcoholism, depression or broken love affairs.
Over 2,500 adolescents killed themselves over unhappy love affairs last year. Others suffer agonies over their attractiveness to the opposite sex. A suicide prevention centre in Bombay dealt with a young man obsessed with his poorly developed genitals. His doctor's attempts at reassurance failed. He killed himself.
Twenty-five-year-old Suparna, also from Bombay, suffered agonies over her small breasts. She was sent to an endocrinologist to see if anything could be done. The answer was no. Suparna threw herself out of a third-floor window.
To the outsider, such suicides appear mystifying because the finality of the solution seems disproportionate to the cause. Ashish, for example, had grown six feet tall by the time he was 15. His classmates teased him about it mercilessly. So he started hunching his shoulders and walking with a droop. This provoked even more ridicule. So he killed himself. An excessive reaction, perhaps, but such anxieties, when they come on top of the normal turmoil of adolescence, can consume the young mind.
The rat race nowadays starts in the classroom where the pressure to succeed can break a child's will to live.
Dr S. G. Dastoor, director of the Samaritans, a counselling centre in Bombay, has seen thousands of adolescents on the brink of suicide in the past 26 years of her professional life. As the numbers increase, she feels frustrated with the families: ""If only parents bothered to spend more time with their children and found out what was troubling them, their lives could be saved. I often think it's the parents who need counselling.""Psychiatrists believe the breakdown of the joint family has a lot to do with the distress and loneliness which can spark off suicidal feelings. It used to provide an emotional safety net. At any given moment, members could be certain of finding a sympathetic ear, a gentle voice, a quiet word of reassurance from within the large unit.
But the collapse - at least in the cities - of the extended family system and the emergence of the nuclear family have meant that tensions have increased. Couples find themselves on their own. This is fine as long as the going is good. But when things go sour and problems arise, the absence of anyone to share the burden or give a word of advice serves to intensify the distress.
When their parents were quarrelling, for example, children could always escape into the cosy arms of their grandmother, aunt or cousin. Now it seems institutions are taking over the functions formerly fulfilled by the family-baby care centres, boarding schools and old people's homes. Says K.N. George, director of the Madras School of Social Work: ""Our present day society has become so intolerant and self-obsessed that it just doesn't care enough for people in need.""
The changes in the family, combined with the stresses of big city life, have given places such as Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Kanpur and Hyderabad record figures for suicide. Madras leads with 21.65 suicides per every lakh of people. This works out roughly to about 850 suicides a year. Bangalore, the fastest-growing city in Asia, has over 600 cases a year, and about 15,000 attempts. As K.B. Valsalakumari, director of the social welfare department in Kerala, says: ""Stress is an international phenomenon but in India most of us don't know how to relax even at week-ends.""
Some don't know how to cope with the pressure of studies and deadlines. A Kanpur medical couple, Dr Manoj Kathura and his wife Bibha, felt that they were being harassed by their professors. Dr Kathura was a post-graduate orthopaedic student. The couple made a death pact and took an overdose. They both died. Bibha was pregnant at the time.
Tolstoy once said that while all happy families were alike, unhappy families were all unhappy in their own way. So are suicidal people. Every person's life circumstances are so different that it's difficult to find any common ground among suicides. But some of the reasons why unhappy people can end up pursuing a death wish to its ultimate conclusion are rooted in Indian culture. Such as the attitude towards women. A childless woman, for example, is made to feel worthless and inadequate. Which might be why Bangalore Doordarshan newsreader, Vandana Suresh, drowned herself by jumping into a pool because she was still childless after four years of marriage.
Dowry, of course, is a social evil which shows no sign of disappearing. In fact, it appears to be spreading south from the north. There were 130 dowry deaths reported in Kerala between 1987 and 1990. Says Valsalakumari: ""Psychiatrists say that more than half of the women lying in the burns wards of our hospitals are suicide attempts because life had become a living hell.""
A poignant example of the trail of destruction that the dowry practice can leave was the recent group suicide of four sisters who lived in the Palghat district of Kerala. Shanti, Sumati, Kanakalatha and Sasikala were totally convinced that their father - a police constable - would never be able to raise the money for their dowries. So they hanged themselves. The youngest was 17. The eldest 25.
Psychiatrists are notorious for not agreeing amongst themselves but on one thing they concur: that the fundamental cause of most suicides is rapid social change. When a society is in flux, when old social structures are disintegrating but new ones haven't yet replaced them, the toll on a person's emotional well-being can be heavy.
Suicide is often the only way out for a lonely wife who realises that her adulterous liaison is about to be exposed and she faces public ostracism.
Some people are well-equipped mentally to deal with the stress of living in a permanently changing society. Others, who find themselves adrift in a swirling maelstrom with none of the usual support systems to anchor them, succumb to frustration. As they feel increasingly left behind and out of control, frustration gives way to despair.
Kerala is a graphic example of a wider phenomenon. Of a society struggling to retain an element of continuity even as change is altering every aspect of daily life. It is perhaps for this reason that it enjoys the dubious distinction of leading the rest of the country. Its suicide rate of 21.06 per every lakh of citizens is three times the national average of 7.03. That is one suicide every hour.
The flood of petro dollars from workers in the Gulf brought prosperity to Kerala but it also left behind a detritus of lonely wives separated from their husbands, maladjusted children who often found solace in drugs or alcohol and the weakening of traditional values. Newly-married Sharda, 23, saw her husband off on a flight to the Gulf a fortnight after their wedding day. He promised her he would return in three months' time and take her with him. Three years later Sharda was still waiting. To ease her loneliness, she developed a liaison with a servant boy. Everything was fine until her mother-in-law discovered the sexual nature of the relationship. Fear seized her. Two days before her husband was to fly into Trivandrum, Sharda hanged herself.
As for those who were unable to migrate and benefit from work in the Gulf, resentment at being left behind set in. Matters were made worse by the fact that education and high literacy rates had generated high expectations of what life should provide. When the good life failed to materialise, it led to a drop in self-esteem. A large number of suicides in Kerala are by the educated unemployed.
P.J. Alexander, former inspector general (crime) in the state observes: ""The inflated ego of the average Malayalee just cannot accept defeat or even life as it is. Since he is educated, he believes he must get the best in life.""
The friends and families of suicides normally blame themselves after the event for not preventing it. Sometimes they're being harsh on themselves but there's a grain of truth in their self-reproaches because the last few weeks in the lives of suicides are usually littered with the clues they dropped. The remarks could range from ""no one understands me"" through to ""I'm only living because of my children."" Psychiatrists say serious attention should be paid to such remarks. They are a desperate cry for help and attention.
But even people who pride themselves on being sensitive and perceptive can be shocked when a friend commits suicide. Like the friends of T.P. Gopinathan, a deputy inspector general of police in Kerala. No one suspected anything was wrong. But he put a revolver to his head one day and fired.
Some unhappy people will succeed in killing themselves no matter what. They set about it with the efficiency and deadly intensity of a Cruise missile looking for its target. It's merely a matter of time before they succeed. A doctor in Kerala who suffered from depression tried to kill himself four times. On the fifth attempt he succeeded. A schizophrenic in Madras threw himself in front of oncoming cars three times but escaped by the skin of his teeth. He succeeded on the fourth attempt by lying underneath an ambulance which crushed him as it reversed.
The highly mysterious nature of suicide has spawned innumerable myths: that people who talk about killing themselves never will; that suicides give no warning signals; that once a person has come through a suicidal phase the danger is over; that suicidal people are mad.
Experts dismiss these lay views as totally fallacious: 75 per cent of people who kill themselves talk about it beforehand; potential suicides give countless clues; a large proportion of people who seem to be making a successful recovery from a suicidal phase go on to kill themselves within three months; and finally, suicidal people may be emotionally disturbed but they are not necessarily mentally ill.
Most suicidal people are depressed. They simply need someone to talk to about what the ""slings and arrows of outrageous fortune"" have done to them. Those who are in mental agony over the state of their lives but don't really want to end it all are the most amenable to treatment. Psychiatric help can often save these people - known as para-suicides (see box) - because they want to be saved.
It is crucial to catch these people before they take the ultimate step, which is why suicide prevention centres are being set up in many of India's big cities. All of them find themselves inundated with callers. Crash courses, seminars and workshops on how to prevent suicide are being organised for volunteers to help them cope with the sheer magnitude of the problem.
The Medico Pastoral Association in Bangalore, a rehabilitation centre for mentally disturbed people, has started a new training course to help volunteers identify a suicidal person. ""Help - lines"" are being set up in cities like Madras and manned by volunteers in their spare time, (see box).
Bangalore psychotherapists Sarojini and Carlos Welch say the treatment for depression is effective, provided the sufferers are caught in time. Some of their patients need only one session to improve their outlook. Others need a dozen. Still others months of intensive psychotherapy. They believe that someone like Sujata could have been saved had she been treated.
How they would treat some of the more bizarre cases of suicide which seem to be peculiar to India would be interesting to find out. Such as the case of Illyansingham Anbunathan, a fan of MGR, who set fire to himself when an anonymous letter accused his wife of being MGR's mistress. As he recovered in hospital, he explained his motives: ""Someone made an insinuation about MGR's character. I couldn't bear to live after that.""
The scorn and sneers heaped by a family-oriented society on a childless woman can force her to choose the oblivion of death.
When student protests over the Mandal Commission report erupted last year, the whole nation was traumatised by the spectacle of a new form of political protest - over two hundred young men and women attemped suicide by either immolating themselves or swallowing insecticide.
Psychiatrists who may otherwise differ on the explanations for such drastic behaviour, agree that one common feature was adolescence. It is a time of volatile emotions and extreme reactions. Mandal simply sparked off already pent-up feelings. Says Kiran Bhatia, a Delhi-based counsellor: ''In addition to the intense frustration and adolescent energy that are let loose, came the blow that opportunities for the future were on the verge of disappearing.""
Another motive was publicity. The self-aggrandisement and martyrdom gave frustrated youngsters a rare opportunity (a classic case of Andy Warhol's 15-minute fame for everyone) to become national figures. Dr D. Mohan, head of psychiatry at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, remarks: ""Otherwise lost souls started finding themselves mentioned in newspapers. In an epidemic, the degree of exposure you get overtakes the pain, the thought of death or even rational thinking.""
On a much smaller scale, the same embrace of death as a form of political action has been taking place in Tamil Nadu since the dismissal of the dmk government and the imposition of President's Rule on January 30. Seven people, mainly dmk workers, immolated themselves in anger at the treatment meted out to the two-year-old ministry.
These suicide attempts are exceptional and it's difficult to see how they could be prevented in future. But professionals who work with more ""typical"" cases of depressed and suicidal individuals know that something as simple as a phone call and a sympathetic voice at the other end of the line can help to convince a desperate person to choose life over death.
But help-lines are rare. Resources are scarce. There are only 200 psychiatrists in the whole of India to take on the pain and heartache of the suicidal. Until such time as more help is available, the unfolding of countless little tragedies will continue.
SNEHA CLINIC: Counselling at the Blink
The phone-line at Sneha clinic in Madras is always busy. Over 7,000 people have called in since it opened two years ago. Housed in a ramshackle building, the suicide prevention clinic and its volunteers have helped many desperate individuals to turn their minds away from thoughts of suicide.
The clinic promises complete confidentiality. The volunteers listen; they do not dispense advice. Nor are they trained psychiatrists. Says Saroja, a volunteer: ""All they need is someone to talk to. Once they've had a chance to talk, their thoughts become clearer and they're better able to take control of their lives."" The only trained psychiatrist in the clinic, Laxmi Vijay Kumar, helped to found it. She says it is vital that volunteers reach a suicidal person in the first three weeks of the crisis if they are to be helped. This is the most dangerous period because most people find it difficult to sustain such a stressful and disturbing emotion for much longer.
Most people ring Sneha. Others, who are more confident, walk in and introduce themselves. Some return time and again, prompting volunteers to observe that it's a lonely world out there. Most people have no one to talk to. Some volunteers break down after hearing a particularly harrowing account of someone's sorrows. At other times they have to control their anger when rapists and perpetrators of incest ring them to ease their guilty consciences.
The 50 volunteers come from a range of backgrounds. They are interviewed by Dr Kumar to ensure that they are committed and caring individuals before they start work. The only thing they have in common is very busy working lives. But all of them devote five to six hours a week to listen to people who are in danger of imploding if they don't find someone to whom they can pour out their emotional troubles.
The clinic survives on donations from the public. The volunteers provide their services free. The method appears to be working. Statistics on success are obviously impossible to collate because of the strict anonymity. None is ever asked for his or her address. Madras is a big city but volunteers have been known to bump into some of the visitors to the clinic. They are under strict instructions to feign complete ignorance.
Despite the lack of statistics, the reaction on the phone can be gauged, particularly if the same person rings again and again. And many people - perhaps long after the crisis - come to the clinic to give a quiet word of thanks to the person whose voice at the other end of the line pulled them back from the brink."

Local police sources claimed on Monday night that they had cracked the case involving the Friday night murder of a young American citizen of Indian descent in Kalkaji area of the city after a drug-fuelled party.Police sources said two security guards, Surender Bali of Madangir (46) and Naresh Mishra of Sangam Vihar (60), had been arrested under IPC Section 302 (murder).Four ""friends"" of Anmol, the boy who was killed, have also been arrested, but under Sec. 27 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, the police sources claimed. The arrested friends are Pranil Shah, to whose South Park, Kalkaji house the victim had gone for a party; Shivank Ghambir, ala Chikki, a resident of Pamposh Enclave; Madhav Bhandari of GK-I and Ridham Girhotra of Govindpuri Extension. All four are in their 20s. The police is looking for the supplier of the drugs they believe were consumed that night.However, the police did not say on what evidence they had made the arrests.Neighbours claimed earlier on Monday that Flat No. 95 (Pranil's home), was a ""drug party destination"". The neighbours alleged that youth would come to the house on a regular basis and get high on drugs and that it was not entirely impossible that a boy was attacked by his friends when they were high on drugs and alcohol.Anmol was a friend of only Shivank, ala Chikki, and met Madhav and Ridham at the party for the first time. Though he had met Pranil (the boy at whose house the party took place) earlier, he had never visited his house in South Park Apartment. It was Chikki who convinced him to come to Pranil's house. The kin of Anmol suspect that he was killed as a part of a conspiracy by Chikki and others.""Anmol had never visited Pranil's house. Before the incident, none of us knew who Pranil was. He had gone to Chikki's house in Pamposh Enclave and from there they decided to go to this party.

On the night of the incident, we heard a commotion in the locality and saw the youth staggering in an inebriated condition. He was bleeding profusely and was trying to find his way out of the locality. He tried to stand against the cars parked here and finally fell to the ground. Finally a guard saw him and made a call to the PCR after which he was taken to hospital."" He added that a forensic team that visited the site found bloodstains on 15 cars in the immediate area.The post-mortem report showed Anmol died due to deep cuts on his head. The police were working on the lines that LSD was supplied at the party and all the youth were high on the drug.According to police sources, they found the wall of Flat No. 95 and the LCD TV inside the house broken and on the basis of this had assumed that Anmol harmed himself while on drugs. When Anmol came to Delhi, he started hanging out with Chikki who introduced him to Pranil and then to Madhav and Ridham.20: Hotel mgmt in LondonAnmol Sarna was born in New York to a businessman father.His father has a transport business in New York and a dry cleaning business in Delhi.Three years after his birth, his family came to Delhi and he stayed here till he was 7 years old, after which he went to New York and lived there with his relatives.Anmol was pursuing a hotel management course from Bristol University in London and was in Delhi with his parents in their Greater Kailash-I house.

Then they killed her dog, tried to set the house on fire after leaving the gas stove on to destroy evidence and decamped with valuables worth Rs 2.5 lakh. All were under 16, from rich, respectable families and had done a professional job of the murder. The reason: they had run up debts of thousands of rupees through a lavish life-style, visiting brothels and five-star hotels.
Manoj Fafri, son of a senior Delhi administration official; Gaurav Kumar, son of a director of a research institute; and Somesh Tripathi, grandson of the late Kamlapati Tripathi; took Robin, a close friend for a drive. On a lonely stretch, they stabbed him to death. Reason: he was carrying Rs 45,000.
Bored during their vacations, four rich boys who had just appeared for their high school exams in Delhi raided a house hoping to get jewellery and cash. Failing to find any, they cold-bloodedly tortured and killed owner Prem Gopal Nair by repeatedly ducking his head into a bucket of insecticide. Ten days later, they attempted another robbery, but were caught. They told the police that they wanted money to go to Mussoorie with their girlfriends.
Sweeping social changes and new role models have combined to fuel a dramatic rise in teenage crime, causing concern to the police, sociologists and, above all bewildered parents.
Sudipa Pal, 17, a ninth standard student in Calcutta, fed her parents and grandparents sweets mixed with poison after testing them on a pig. When they were dead, she tied all of them with electric wire and connected it to the mains to make it look like mass suicide. She eliminated them in the expectation that they would hinder her relationship with her tutor Randhir Bose, 51. She showed no sign of remorse. Appearing for her tenth standard exams shortly after, she scored distinction marks.
Robbery. Murder. Rape. Car thefts. Kidnapping for ransom. These are crimes expected of hardened criminals. Not of your respectable neighbour's 17-year-old son, or your mild-spoken college-going nephew.
Or even your own daughter. Youngsters you trusted and knew), But with more and more teenagers from well-to-do families turning to crime, tremors of shock are rippling through Indian society, tor some youngsters, it is a shortcut to riches.
Others, already rich, are bored teenagers looking for kicks. Whatever their motives, the facts are alarming enough to leave police and psychologists perplexed, parents anguished and schoolmates mystified.
After his schoolmates killed Vora, Kapil Anand, 19, went into a state of depression and shock as he could not believe they could do it: ""I wondered if I could trust my friends because I just could not fathom how these cool rich guys could do this. No one suspected them.""
Crack police teams in Calcutta did not suspect the nubile, but innocent-looking Pal of having the audacity to murder her parents and grandparents either.
Says a police officer: ""Even after arresting her, we kept wondering if we had gone wrong somewhere."" Adds Neeraj Kumar, senior superintendent of police in Delhi: ""We can crack down on crime and criminals. But how do we control a sociological phenomenon driving teenagers to crime?""
He is referring to the fact that youngsters are more violent than ever before. They are in the forefront of riots and political violence. Campus crime has become too commonplace to shock. Their role models are Arun Gawli and Dawood Ibrahim. Many of these young criminals are not lumpen elements but bright youngsters looking for quick money to finance flashy life-styles.
Out of 61.2 7 lakh officially registered crimes throughout the country in 1990, over 32.87 lakh were committed by those under 30. In metros like Delhi and Bombay as many as 70 per cent of those arrested for various crimes are under 25.
In Bombay, 71 per cent of dacoities, 77 per cent of robberies and 74 per cent of murders were perpetrated by those under 25.
Five years ago, there were just two or three teenagers involved in dacoities in Calcutta every year. Now it is more than ten times that figure. Points out Ajit Ghosh, Calcutta's deputy commissioner of police: ""Today's major criminals are aged between 18 and 22.""
Even smaller places are seeing the trend. Eric Ekka, jailor at Sajiwa, Imphal, observes: ""Ruthless youngsters are seeing crime as a new way of life."" Of the 610 prisoners at his jail, 80 per cent are in their 20s.
Criminologists and sociologists are worried that it can only get worse. Why are normal teenagers taking to crime? Experts offer a host of reasons but generalisations are often too superficial.
Criminologist Shubral Sanyal of the National Institute of Criminology and Forensic Science (NICFS) in Delhi believes that most affluent teenagers are lapsing into crime as a way of wreaking revenge on uncaring parents.
""Youth with incomplete lives fall into deviant behaviour to gratify themselves. The danger of crime makes them feel alive.""
Dayal Mirchandani Bombay Psychiatrist
Indifference and abuse instead of attention and affection can make emotional cripples of children. This cycle then culminates in deviant behaviour. Bombay psychiatrist Dayal Mirchandani says: ""Youngsters leading dissatisfied and incomplete lives get into deviant behaviour to gratify themselves. The excitement derived gives them a feeling of being alive.""
Others blame it on social changes. Criminologist James Vadackumchery who works in Trivandrum believes: ""When society itself is becoming criminal and escapist, how can we expect our youngsters to behave differently?""
In a way, the teenager is only reflecting the chaos and aggression in society, its acquisitive urges, and the degeneration of values.
The youth see cheats triumphing in exams, degrees being auctioned and jobs not necessarily going to the best candidate. This was best exemplified by the Mandal agitation during which scores of students in Delhi took to the streets and indulged in wanton violence.
Many made human torches of themselves, frustrated that their merit and hard work were no longer valid criteria for college admissions and jobs.
Today's youngster is cynical, angry, desperate. He sees gangster politicians, smugglers and underworld dons - even parents - getting rich and powerful through dubious means. Points out T.K. Oommen of the Centre for the Study of Social Systems at the Jawaharlal Nehru University: ""Before Independence, youngsters had a sense of purpose, fighting for freedom.

But after that, values crumbled, corruption became institutionalised and anti-social elements grew in stature with illegitimate money. Catapulted into powerful positions, they commanded respect. The message sent out to the young was that this was the way of the world.""
Says eminent sociologist M.N. Srinivas: ""We have not really taken the trouble to understand the teenage mind. How can we just blame them? Society itself has become violent and materialistic. Parents rarely empathise with their children, talk to them, help them out with their confusion or neutralise their frustrations.""
Nuclear families are increasingly characterised by working parents who are treading a tightrope between home and work. While they spend lavishly on their children, they can end up denying them the care and the time they need, not to mention the discipline which has to be inculcated in the early years. Children who feel emotionally abandoned look elsewhere for companionship and acceptance.
Take the case of three rich college girls from Shertallai in Kerala. Anju Joseph, 17, Sindhu Thomas, 18, and Safeena, 19, left home feeling lonely and angry. They wanted companionship and excitement.
When the police caught up with them, they were part of an underworld gang in Goa. ""They were so mild-mannered. I still can't understand why they did it,"" says a friend of the trio.
Wealthy Sirhan Shah, 19, who lives on Peddar Road in Bombay, stole three motorcycles and a Maruti car. Sirhan told the police that though his family had a car, he wanted his own, like his peers.
For parents, seeing their children take to crime is traumatic. Teacher Shetram Mishra was stunned when his son, Siddhivinayak, 20, was arrested for forging a Rs 30,000-cheque: ""I have lost self-respect. But how can I disown him?""
""Fear of the law has gone. Some trials take place after years. With the collapse of the judicial system, youth believe crime pays.""
Subramaniam Ramamurthy
Bombay Police Commissioner
Divorce and separation add to the problem. Studies at Nirmala Niketan show that 60 per cent of juvenile delinquents come from broken families. Says Mohan Issac, assistant professor of psychiatry at nimhans: ""Squabbling parents are poor role models. Invariably, teenage criminals reflect the sorry situation at home.""
Akram, 14, is a perfect example. His nights were often spent on Bombay's pavements to escape abuse from his alcoholic father. Eventually, he fell into the company of teenage criminals who stole car carburettors. ""My father drove me to crime,"" he says.
Abdul Sajid, 17, caught for house-breaking, hates his father who left when he was 10: ""I don't even want to see him."" Psychiatrist Shoba Srinath believes the only solution is for families to devote quality time to children and play an intimate role in their emotional growth.
Police agree that most teenage criminals have emotional problems at home, primarily a communication problem with their parents. In New Delhi, police found that the millionaire parents of four school students involved in car stereo thefts had never bothered to find out why they stayed out late.
They accused the police of framing their sons till the evidence was produced: stacks of car stereos in their children's rooms which they were unaware of. The students said they did it ""for fun and adventure"".
Police brutality hardens the young ones Police brutality hardens the young ones
In today's parlance, fun for a teenager could mean anything. For Nakul Wahi, Dhruv Goyal, Sanjeev Jacob and Amar Upadhyaya, all from rich Delhi families, it meant driving a Maruti to Agra, wearing masks, and entering the house of ophthalmologist N.N. Aggarwal. They held him at gunpoint and looted cash and jewellery worth Rs 2.5 lakh while one of them sat in the car with a walkie-talkie set.
When the police caught them, they discovered that the gang was well equipped and very well organised. The bottle of chloroform, the nylon ropes, the surgical gloves, the face masks and the pistol showed only too depressingly that their crimes were committed in cold blood and with total calculation.
Says Pune-based lawyer-activist Aroona Nafday Goswami: ""Trying to be westernised, many parents keep away from their children's rooms to give them 'space'. So they have no idea what their children are seeing on the video or doing in their spare time. With modern-day pressures and values, parents find little time to instill discipline or respect for the law.""
In Delhi, minors often drive cars to school. When the police hauled up dozens of such children outside Modern School, they nonchalantly paid the fines. Says Sub-Inspector Laxman Wagh in Bombay: ""Rich children feel everything can be bought. Even acquittal.""
In the first half of March, Delhi Police cracked down on 323 children below 18. Traffic Commissioner Maxwell Pereira says criminally indulgent parents encourage such acts which symbolise how rich children are encouraged to fool around with the law.
Says Madhava Menon, director of the National Law School of India University at Bangalore: ""Parents should be penalised as they should be responsible for what their children do.""
""Young criminals can be reformed by social workers rather than the police as their circumstances need to be investigated, not the crime.""

Today, the formative years of a child are frittered away in a fast-moving world. While scholastic performance grabs the limelight, the emotional development is ignored. Personality profiles done by Bombay counsellor Shenaz Elavia on teenagers with criminal tendencies indicated poorly developed personalities.
When children internalise their anxieties, they suffer emotional disorders. When they externalise them, they become anti-social - stubborn, aggressive and violent.
Fuelling this trend is the breakdown of the system of criminal justice. Convictions take an eternity. When a case finally comes to trial, witnesses are untraceable.
Teenagers arrested 20 years ago in Calcutta are yet to be convicted. Bombay Commissioner of Police Subramaniam Ramamurthy echoes a common concern: ""With the collapse of the criminal justice system, the message now is that crime pays.""
Teacher Rukmani Srinivas in Bangalore says that students ridicule her when she talks of honesty as a value. They ask why they can't think of striking it rich when Harshad Mehta can make his millions and politicians get kickbacks. ""Twenty years ago, we wanted to work hard and build a career. Today, teenagers are looking for quick wealth,"" says K. Srinivas, inspector-general of police, Bangalore.
Adolescence can often be a tremendously traumatic phase, with its agonies, frustrations, rages and uncertainties too easily underestimated by parents and laughed off by society.
Peer pressure is overpowering and unless parents exert their own influence, youngsters whose characters are yet to crystalise can be swayed by friends' values in their desperation to win approval.
Tongminthang, 20, from Churachandpur, Manipur, broke away from drug addiction during a jail term in a drug-related case. But once free, he was dragged back into it by peer pressure. He found himself part of a gang stealing to finance their addiction, and is in jail again.

If drugs are inflating juvenile crime figures, so is terrorism. Terrorists have always found it easy to lure teenagers in Punjab, Kashmir and the North-east. As Peter Ngahanyui, dig Crime, at Imphal, points out: ""Being between the ages of 16 and22, they are easy to indoctrinate.""
Frankee Sema, 19, was lured from Kohima into a banned insurgent organisation. Carried away by ideological fervour at a camp in Burma, he was more than happy to rob a Shillong bank at gunpoint.
But most criminologists argue that the prime motive for teenage crime is quick and easy money. Says B.N. Chattoraj, a professor at NICFS: ""Nowadays, the accent is on money and no one cares how it is acquired. So teenagers opt for the easiest way out as working hard is no longer the way to get it.""
Crime files in every city have hundreds of examples: Mohanraj ,19, thought his hosiery unit job at Tirupur in Tamil Nadu would never make him rich. So he wrote an anonymous note to five-year-old actress Shyamlee saying that he had been paid Rs 50,000 to kill her and if she paid him Rs 1 lakh, he would eliminate her enemy. As he walked into a police trap, he confessed: ""I wanted to get rich quick.""
The brutality involved can be chilling. Viswajeet, Vajpayee, Neeraj and Pawan had yet to turn 18 when they took a friend Arun Thapa, 16, to a secluded area in Delhi, hit him on the head with an iron rod till he died and threw him into a well. They did this as Thapa was demanding part of the money they had made from selling his mother's jewellery - itself stolen.
Or consider the case of an army officer in Delhi numbed by the horror of his dynamic, popular young son taking to murder. At school, girls doted on him, cajoling him to take them out for coffee at the nearby Oberoi.
Entertaining was expensive, Vikram Ramphal soon realised. He was drawn into the easiest way to make a fast buck - crime. Beginning with stealing video cassette recorders, he graduated to robberies carried out at knife-point.
""Teenagers with criminal tendencies are merely reflecting the increasingly violent and materialistic side of society.""
M.N. Srinivas Bangalore Sociologist
But when he cleaned up jewellery and cash worth Rs 3 lakh from his family doctor's house, the police caught up with him. A jail sentence at Tihar merely hardened him. Soon after his release, he knifed to death R.P. Tuli, a rich New Delhi businessman, while robbing his house. When he was jailed again, he had yet to celebrate his 20th birthday. His parents have yet to recover from the shock.
Parents agree that children today demand huge sums of pocket money. They take pride in discussing how their school-going children need over Rs 100 a day. Points out Kumar: ""The idea of entertainment has changed. We used to go to the theatre, listen to music or read. But today the youngster wants to be seen eating and shopping at upmarket places.""
When the high-profile Vasavi Vidya Niketan School in Bangalore warned the parents of Balaji and Suraj, both 16, that they should not give their sons over a thousand rupees as pocket money, they were ignored. Balaji reportedly asked schoolmates Lathendra, 20, Bhaskar, 19 and Mahesh, 18, to kill Suraj after paying them Rs 3,500 and promising them more.
The three did just that. Balaji, the son of a grain merchant, said he wanted to take revenge on Suraj's parents for squabbling with his parents. For his classmates and teachers, this was almost unconceivable for they never thought the frail, bespectacled Balaji could be so vicious.
In fact, the most troubling aspect of teenage crime is the senseless brutality. When Madhavi, 5, was kidnapped from Shakarpur in Delhi, her family found comfort only in close friend Ramesh, 22.
He came every day to console the family and plead that they pay the Rs-4,000 ransom. But when he offered to talk to the kidnappers and got Madhavi's clothes as evidence, the family informed the police.

By then, he had killed her. Jhula, a 16-year-old orphan, was given all he wanted by his grandfather Bipin Sen. But when he demanded a motorcycle, Sen refused, arguing it was dangerous to drive in Calcutta. Jhula beat him to death. In Kanpur, two teenagers battered a cobbler because he didn't repair their chappals on time.
Why has the teenager imbibed so much violence? Sociologists cite the overdose in films and on satellite television as the main reason. By the time the Indian child is in his teens, he has seen thousands of brutal acts on television and video.
When Chandan, a Bangalore medical student, strangled his uncle to death in a car for the Rs 1 lakh he carried, he did it exactly the way he had seen it in The Godfather.
Social workers and counsellors feel jailing and institutionalising youngsters are not the solutions. Families should be helped to establish a rapport with them, rebuilding a sense of values and purpose. Jails only corrupt them further. Calcutta's Deputy Commissioner of Police Prasun Mukherjee, is trying counselling.
When Arvind Sen, a 10th standard student from a well-placed family in Calcutta was picked up by the police for stealing eight two-wheelers, Mukherjee did not arrest him. Instead, he counselled him and his parents who, all too predictably, could not believe it. They realised they had lost touch with their son as they were too busy with their careers.
The real challenge lies in the years ahead. Little can be gained from pointing an accusing finger at the teenager alone. Society needs to take a hard, careful look at itself and the values it is promoting.
""With modern day pressures and values, parents have little time to instill discipline or respect for the law in their children.""
Aroona Nafday Goswami Pune Lawyer
As Srinivas points out tartly, we cannot sit back and pride ourselves on being a religious and spiritually-inclined society unless we take on the burden of instilling the right values in our children and taking concrete steps to stem the flood of materialism.
It is too easy to disclaim responsibility for the crimes and misdemeanours of the next generation. Unless society believes these young criminals are inherently wicked, it should respond to their cries for help."
120,"Issue Date: Apr 15, 1993",[],2013-08-12 19:10:50,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"An alarming chain of events that unfolded last month has caused considerable embarrassment and convulsions in the higher command levels of the army.
Top level courts of inquiry have opened up a Pandora's box, involving misuse of funds and command failure in the sensitive Eastern Command that plays a strategic role in defending the border against China and in containing insurgency in the North-east.
Key professional reputations have been tarnished. The services of a Lt General, N.P.S. Bal, have been terminated. Two major-generals and several officers face inquiries. One brigadier has been dismissed from service and two others face trial.
The details have been pieced together by india today with access to reports of courts of inquiry and high-level official correspondence.
The disturbing story began soon after Major-General Vinod Saighal, an armoured corps officer and former military attache to France, took over command of 27 Mountain Division on March 17,1991. Differences arose with Lt General Bal, then GOC of 33 Corps, a Param Vishisht Seva Medal recipient with considerable combat experience.
Bal's career had a brush with controversy in 1984 when he was accused of being 'soft' towards Sikh army deserters. He was later exonerated. Within 17 days of taking over, Saighal sent a signal to HQ 33 Corps expressing reservations about the ""strategies for the '90s and proposed redeployment and dual tasking of formations"".
The plan called for thinning out the army in the Himalayas in view of the receding threat from China. To Bal's chagrin, Saighal sent a copy of his dissenting note to the Command HQ in Calcutta. Bal asked him not to bypass the Corps HQ. Saighal ignored this: ""The national interest requires that those directly charged with preserving the sanctity of the country's frontiers communicate their misgivings to their military superiors.""
""The termination of Bal's services was unprecedented and came as a great shock to me."" LT General (RETD) K.S. Brar
Former GOC-in-C, Eastern Command
Finally, Lt General K.S. Brar, then GOC-IN-C, Eastern Command, had to warn Saighal: ""I've found in you a consistent tendency to question orders..in an effort to project yourself as an 'independent thinker'."" The strategy was nonetheless implemented.
Differences between Saighal and Bal surfaced again when Major Rajiv Khanduri, posted in HQ 27 Mountain Division, died from gunshot injuries in mysterious circumstances on May 25, 1991. An inquiry ruled out foul play. But Saighal was not satisfied.
He appointed an 'evaluation committee' which recommended a CBI inquiry. Saighal wrote to the Army HQ, alleging foul play and referred to rumours about an alleged extra-marital affair involving a senior officer. But Bal and Brar decided to go by the inquiry report. Saighal was again reprimanded for overstepping himself.
From then on, it was an undeclared war between Saighal and Bal. One instance was the inquiry into the canteen of HQ 123 Mountain Brigade, commanded by Brigadier G.S. Kahlon. Saighal alleged that Kahlon had been provided 'immunity' by his predecessor, Major-General Kulwant Singh, and Bal. But Bal maintained that Saighal was blowing the whole thing out of proportion.
As the top commanders locked horns, several other units of 27 Mountain Division got into trouble. According to inquiries, an engineers' regiment was alleged to have misappropriated operational funds; a battalion of the Bihar Regiment (2 Bihar) was accused of selling coal dust illegally; and a battalion of the Garhwal Rifles (19 Garhwal) was allegedly running an unauthorised soda water factory. Allegations surfaced against the ordnance unit of the division and the ordnance set-up in HQ 33 Corps.
Meanwhile, there was a dispute between Saighal and Bal over an adverse evaluation given by Saighal to Brigadier M.P.S. Kondal, commander, 166 Mountain Brigade. Instead of accepting Saighal's dim view of his brigadier, Bal decided to organise an exercise in October 1991 to test Kondal's proficiency.
Saighal complained that Bal was interfering in his command. But Bal maintained that he chose to test Kondal personally to ensure that he was not being treated unfairly.
The shenanigans continued. A battalion of the Sikh Regiment (19 Sikh) - a part of 27 Mountain Division-became the centre of controversy when two of its officers were roughed up by jawans. Bal ordered another officer, an alcoholic, to be hospitalised and had the commandant replaced.
Saighal complained against Bal's interference. But Bal's response was: since Saighal never visited the unit, he, as the regiment's ceremonial colonel-commandant had to ensure things did not get out of hand.
The constant skirmishes were bound to escalate into a full-blown battle and the involvement of the Army HQ and Defence Ministry was inevitable. Saighal wrote several letters to the ministry.
One contained insinuations of a ""communal nexus"" between various senior officers in the Command, others spoke of the presence of 'anti-national elements' in the Corps. Some of the communications were anonymous.
That led to the Military Secretary's branch at Army HQ scrutinising the annual confidential reports initiated by the concerned officers. In an unusual move, the Army HQ appointed a court of inquiry in October 1991 headed by the then vice-chief of army staff, Lt General V.K. Sood.
Eventually, Bal was removed from the command of 33 Corps and appointed director-general, Rashtriya Rifles, at New Delhi. Saighal too was removed and appointed deputy commandant, College of Combat, Mhow.
Sood is reported to have expressed dismay at the state of affairs in 33 Corps. Following this, Kulwant Singh was removed from a pivotal appointment in the HQ Western Command and posted as deputy commandant, Infantry School, Belgaum.
He was issued a show cause notice for the award of the army chiefs 'displeasure', and action is yet to be taken.
But that was not the end of the story. The sorry saga, in fact, took a strange twist. Saighal, the cause of much of the controversy, suddenly saw a change in his professional fortunes. He was given command of 24 Rapid Division in the Western Sector, a more sensitive command than his earlier command of the Mountain Division.
His rehabilitation is still steeped in mystery and is viewed by many officers of the Eastern Command as being another example of the imbalance and inconsistency in decisions taken by the Defence Ministry. However, Army HQ sources said Saighal was given a 'second command' in view of his representation against the adverse report filed against him.
The unusual turnaround in Saighal's case is more surprising considering the action taken against others. On the basis of separate inquiries, several other officers are to face court martial. Kahlon has been sentenced to dismissal.
Eight officers of 123 Mountain Brigade are facing action. And the 33 Corps deputy director of ordnance, a brigadier, who has since retired, continues to be 'attached' for court martial proceedings.
Bal, meanwhile, was given a show cause notice last October on the basis of Sood's inquiry, for award of 'severe displeasure' of the army chief on four counts. The charges included misuse of manpower and army transport, failing to report property returns satisfactorily, failing to accommodate views different from his own, interference in the command of subordinates and exhibiting lack of firmness in dealing with Saighal.
But then, instead of inviting the army chief s displeasure, Bal was dismissed by the Government on January 25 under Section 18 of the Army Act, 1950, and his decorations withdrawn.
""The termination of Bal's services in this manner was not only unprecedented but came as a great shock to me,"" said Brar, adding that while Saighal's conduct was unbecoming of an officer, he had no complaints against Bal.
Regretting that the action against Bal and the rehabilitation of Saighal were done within days of his retirement on October 1, 1992 as GOC-IN-C, Eastern Command, Brar observed: ""What value is an army commander if his views are to be undermined.""
Sood is unwilling to talk: ""I completed the inquiry in November 1991 and retired in February 1992. The action against Bal may be related to something that happened after that.""
Full details of the episode may never be known. But it raises many disturbing questions about key areas of the army's functioning. Ego clashes and disagreements are nothing new among senior officers in professional armies.
But the way these undermined the Eastern Command and the fact that charges and countercharges of incompetence and even a communal nexus were allowed to be tossed around as if it were routine bureaucratic warfare in a government department, is extremely disturbing.
While refusing to comment on the episode, the Army HQ says steps have been taken to prevent a recurrence. But judging by the curious twists and turns in the recent happenings in the crucial Eastern Command, that is unlikely to be taken seriously by the officers whose careers depend on the whims of the military bureaucracy."

- Bangalore, K.S. RAO
I am anguished by the immorality of means and the crude tactics adopted by the Rao Government to defeat the no-confidence motion sponsored by the combined opposition (""A Battered PM"", August 15). Never in the past had a government at the Centre stooped to ignoble means like using money and indulging in horse-trading to remain in power. While the Congress(I) has only served to further erode morality in public life, the moral authority of the Government to rule the country has been undermined.
- Hyderabad, S.B. Singh
The role played by Mulayam Singh Yadav in the survival of the Congress(I) Government cannot be easily dismissed. He nurtures dreams of becoming chief minister of Uttar Pradesh by riding on Narasimha Rao's shoulders. But are these weak shoulders capable of carrying him?
- Dehra Dun, Shailendra Seinger
Rao Is Irreplaceable
The opinion poll (""Three Way Split"", August 15) reveals two very interesting aspects of the public mood. They are: the emerging consensus on the Ram Mandir and Rao's lead in comparison to other prime ministerial hopefuls. Isn't it ironical that Rao still commands confidence in spite of the scandals besieging him? This only highlights the sad fact that there is an absolute lack of credible leaders in the country.
- Pune, Vijayan B.
Your electoral prediction does not take into account political parties other than the main three - Congress(I), BJP, National Front-Left Front combine. The smaller, regional parties play a crucial role in determining the result in a general election.
- Madras, C.T. Vairavan
The opinion poll only highlights how short public memory is and the ease with which politicians manipulate the minds of the people. This is reflected in the way political equations have undergone a complete change within a short span of six months. But the sad part is that we Indians are caught between the devil and the deep sea. Even if there is a mid-term poll, there isn't much to choose from.
- Indore, Ananth Srinivas
Your story based on the MARG poll seems to have been cooked up within the four walls of your office. If you think there is no BJP wave, all you need to do is hold a mid-term poll to find out the truth.The way the BJP has grown in the past few years is only because of the personality of L.K. Advani. I do not believe that he comes fourth in the race for prime minister. Next time you publish a so-called opinion poll, make sure that you present it in such a way that it does not look or sound so made-up.
- New Delhi, Asha Prabha
A surefire way to escape any kind of punishment for committing crimes in India is to become a politician.
Criminal Farce
This is a case of grotesque juxtaposition (""Gunning for Cover"", August 15). Men who are facing criminal charges are being protected by the state while it is society which needs protection from them. And the very same state is, on the other hand, fighting these men in the courts.
- Bhopal, Khalid Al Hasan
The Time Crunch
It is hard to believe that bereft of its Air Time Committee (ATC), Doordarshan was unable to evolve reasonable criteria for allotting time slots on its satellite channels (""Air Time Inanities"", August 15). If that was really the case, one is hard put to explain DD's success on its two channels. Besides, it will be grossly underestimating the Indian bureaucracy's sophistication to blame it on plain incompetence. The real reason perhaps was the time crunch.
Hyderabad, Dr Codadu Pratap
Still Smoky
One can't be certain even now whether the CBI will be able, or allowed, to produce clinching evidence linking Rajiv Gandhi with the Bofors pay-off (""The Smoke Clears, August 15). But it doesn't really matter. Anyone who believes that the late prime minister was not one of the beneficiaries must be naive or a fool. Or Mani Shankar Aiyar.

With the politicians busy nurturing their, can anyone stop Delhi from turning into a Transylvanian City ofConcrete?
Let Reason Reign
Your story on the rationalist movement (""The Triumph of Reason"", August 15) was refreshing. People need to emerge from the shadows of astrology and superstition. They need to discover that success depends on the work of their hands and not on the lines on their palms. On the other hand, it is necessary to realise that science too is not infallible. When I was at school we were taught that neutrons were the smallest particles. Now we have discovered neutrinos and quarks.

Big Busybody
By forcing Russia to backtrack on its deal with India to supply cryogenic rocket technology (""Misguided Muscle"", August 15), Uncle Sam has clearly proved that in addition to its many faults, it is also the biggest busybody in the world. By his abject surrender to US blackmail, Boris Yeltsin has damaged his own stature and credibility. I'm certain the Russian President would even roll over and play dead if his American masters asked him to.
- New Delhi, Samir Mahajan
The US has once again established its credentials as a 'world policeman' by forcing Russia to break its agreement with India. Obviously the US is concerned about our success in space technology and wants to protect its own multimillion-dollar arms market. The Government must provide adequate funds, necessary facilities and moral support to our technocrats and scientists to undertake a space research programme to devise an indigenous substitute for the cryogenic engine technology.
- Solan, Pramod Sharma
Why do the Americans call their foreign minister Secretary of State? Judging by their meddling, it's possible that they consider all countries in the world to be their own states.
Cleaning the Capital
The most important thing is to control the menace of air pollution (""Capital Punishment"", August 15). The main culprit is the ever increasing number of vehicles on the road. It is, therefore, imperative that air pollution control legislation be strictly implemented immediately. The authorities should be equipped with modern gadgets to check the levels of emission and must be empowered to file cases against the defaulters. Above all, the courts should decide cases promptly in order to deter offenders.
- New Delhi, K.K. Bajaj
The problems of Delhi, so professionally summed up by you, are really well known. What is lacking is any long-term plan to tackle them with sincerity and determination. The greatest need at the moment is to set up an efficient transport system by implementing the Metropolitan Rapid Transport System through public and private funding. A few zones in the city could be declared out of bounds for private vehicles. Pedestrian plazas will cut down traffic snarls in the congested areas. If none of these plans work and things continue to deteriorate, we could shift the capital elsewhere and hope that history does not repeat itself.
- Bangalore, D.B.N. Murthy
In a typically Indian way we will all complain about our suffering, vehemently discuss Delhi's problems till we tire ourselves and then continue life as before. Nobody will take the initiative and take the necessary decisions. Ideas and proposals will be written down and then be lost in the bureaucratic jungle.

Stress on Quantity
Your special survey on housing (""Building on Shortages"", August 15) was enlightening and relevant. However, you have not stressed the necessity of building large-scale low-cost housing. For most people interested in just finding a roof over their heads, fancy flats and bungalows are out of reach. There must be emphasis on the construction of inexpensive dwellings and importance should be given to utility and comfort rather than merely style and decor.
- Panchkula, Haryana, Alok Gupta
Denigrating Ourselves
Your tribute to A.K. Ramanujan (""Without Obituary"", August 15) cites the MacArthur prize as ""the highest critical accolade in the US"", while the Sahitya Akademi is called ""puny"". The former, established by an insurance tycoon, is nothing more than a monetary award given to dozens every year - well known and obscure, accomplished and potentially outstanding - merely to relieve them of the need to chase money. Do we still need to drool over any little recognition abroad while denigrating our own institutions?
- Madras, S. Ashok
Miraculous Mata
Let us not make any generalisations about godmen. There are things which supersede and triumph over logic and these are also worth contemplating.
The sarcasm and tone of your story on Mata Amritanandamayi, is intolerable (""The Gurus For the '90s"". July 31). My wife and I were deemed by doctors to be infertile but we were blessed with a child only by her divine grace and love. Amma's children shed tears of joy and relief lying in her lap. We offer these tears to our Mata. What qualification, what spiritual authority do you possess to write about one who is the divine mother of the universe?
- Madras, T.N. Krishnachandran
Mata Amritanandamayi, who you have written so harshly about, is the ambrosia that saved my husband's life and restored our domestic harmony. He was an alcoholic and smoking for over a decade. Then, just one confession to the Mata brought about a transformation which neither the Alcoholics Anonymous nor a clinical psychologist was able to bring about. I will be eternally grateful to her.

A Question of Trust
Lt-General A.S. Bhullar, director-general, Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), is right in saying in his letter that the BIS is the first organisation to issue quality system certificates. But Indian Register Quality Systems (IRQS), a department of Indian Register of Shipping, is the first duly accredited Indian organisation for certification of quality systems (""Certified Fit"", Trade Winds, May 31).
The certification system of the BIS has not been independently verified as meeting internationally accepted criteria for certification bodies, unlike IRQS which has been accredited by Raad voor de Certificatie of the Netherlands. Consequently, the BIS certificate may not be easily accepted by importers abroad. This is not to say that the BIS system is inferior. What is urgently needed is a national accreditation system and organisation - like the UK's National Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies - as recommended by the EC experts' group.

Who is Mahesh Chand Sharma? He is a 52-year-old man from Jaipur, with balding pate and hawk eyes. He started his career as a humble compounder at the tuberculosis clinic of Sawai Man Singh Hospital. In the last nine years, he has swiftly moved up the ladder of success: From storekeeper to nurse to lecturer to observer of the Indian Nursing Council (INC). Along the way, he has amassed wealth that would turn politicians green with envy: Rs 200 crore. He has 10 bank accounts, 30 properties and ownership stake in 25 nursing colleges.How did he do it? Well, as his colleagues would testify, he is very good at ""managing"". He 'managed' to win the Florence Nightingale nursing award in 2008, for his ""dedication to sufferers"", much to the surprise of those who have never seen him in hospital wards. He 'managed' the top bosses of INC so well that he became the 'single-window approver' of government clearance for all nursing colleges in Rajasthan. He has 'managed' healthcare promoters beautifully-withholding paperwork till they greased his palms with the desired sum. And he has 'managed' ministers and bureaucrats so effectively that when the Rajasthan Anti-Corruption Bureau caught him red-handed for pocketing a bribe of Rs 5 lakh on June 30, threatening phone calls started pouring in.Welcome to the Republic of Bribe, where nothing gets done until the right palm is greased with the right amount. One in two Indians regularly pays bribes when dealing with public institutions, estimates Transparency International's (TI) July 2013 survey, Global Corruption Barometer. ""It has turned almost into an art form,"" says sociologist Dipankar Gupta. Someone pays-to speed up paperwork, avoid trouble with authorities, access basic services-and someone is paid off. The job is done. Everyone smiles. In the TI report, two out of three people believe personal contacts help to get things done in the public sector. More than one in two think governments are run by groups acting in their own interests rather than for the benefit of the citizens. ""Bribe thrives when there is a pervasive belief that the powerful are able to get away with it,"" says Gupta. ""People lose trust in institutions and in those entrusted with power.""Big-ticket bribes make big news. And this year, with multi-crore bribery cases blowing up every month, the market price of big-league bribery is out there: July promises to reveal the bribe rate for solar panel rip-offs brewing in Kerala now; in June, CBI revealed Rs 2.25 crore as the going rate for allocating coal blocks; in May, it was Rs 10 crore for cadging a plum post on the Railway Board. Speculation ran rife in May: If retail giant Walmart paid $230 million to get access in a small country like Mexico, what did it pay in India? Three cricketers were arrested in May and Rs 40-Rs 60 lakh seemed to be the pay-off for giving away a pre-fixed number of runs in a given over. In April, Bengal millionaire Sudipta Sen's confessions to CBI exposed Rs 1 crore to be the monthly facilitation fee to politicians, police and tax officials for running a chit fund. In February, it was Rs 362 crore for buying VVIP choppers. In January, Rs 60 crore emerged as the sum a revenue officer could demand to conduct a 'favourable' investigation in the multi-crore Stock Guru swindle.How much does India pay to navigate through everyday life? I Paid a Bribe, a website run by Bangalore think tank Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy, gives some clue unique to that puzzle. An exclusive sharing of data with India Today reveals an invisible economy spanning across the country. It vibrates with thousands of angry complainants forced to pay bribe under duress: ""Angry but helpless,"" ""I'm so angry that I paid the bribe."" To Swati Ramanathan, co-founder of Janaagraha who runs the website, ""With wholesale bribery at the top levels of the nation, we are losing sight of what is right and what is wrong. To me, anyone who is angry enough to report a bribe is an agent of change."" Complainants urge each other to shrug off the burden of bribery on the website: ""Change will come,"" ""May God save this country.""I Paid A Bribe records a whopping Rs 1,86,57,20,642 shelled out as bribe by 23,091 Indians from 544 cities, over a period of three years (see graphic). That makes Rs 26,932 the average bribe paid by a regular Indian in a year. Of the metros, if Delhi is the hub of big-ticket kickbacks, the culture of steep under-the-table pay-offs pervades civic life the most in Chennai, followed by Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Kolkata (see chart). But who do you bribe the most? The biggest slice goes to the police, for passport verification (30 per cent) and traffic violations (25 per cent). Proficient at the art of sponging secret money at the bottom of the pyramid are lower level government officials: 15 per cent of bribes are spent on property registration; 10 per cent on securing a driving licence.Police bribes make for maximum nuisance, minimum value. ""I paid Rs 50 to a police constable. Reason? My car was parked for less than one minute,"" says a Mumbai complainant. ""I know FIR is free but they charged me Rs 200 as,"" comments another from Amritsar. ""I was told that the going bribe rate for passport verification was Rs 500,"" puts in a Kolkata man. ""Does the government pay them a salary or not?"" asks an irate Delhi man. ""He was worse than a beggar."" College students are easy prey. ""They force us to withdraw money from the ATM, put us in their suv, scare us in the police station, unless they are satisfied with the money,"" says Bangalore student Zeeshan Ali, who has had to pay Rs 500 for sitting with a girl, a classmate, in a public place.Abhinay Joshi, 30, a Bangalore accountant, was driving back home with his wife after dinner at a friend's place in March. Around midnight, he was stopped on Inner Ring Road for a breath test. He was stunned when told that the meter showed high alcohol content. He had conscientiously stayed off alcohol. When he wanted to see the reading, the police curtly refused, confiscated his registration certificate, licence and threatened to issue a notice. It could even mean a jail term for six months. A young plain-clothed officer 'solved' Joshi's problem by asking him, very politely, if he wanted to avoid all the hassle by paying Rs 2,500-without receipt, of course.In contrast, lower level government officials angle for bigger stakes. In February, Atul Mhatre, a clerk with Mumbai's City and Industrial Development Corporation, was killed by real estate agents for demanding too steep a bribe, Rs 20 lakh, to regularise an unauthorised construction. The same month, the Madhya Pradesh Lokayukta police caught Arjun Singh Lalwani, a grade II clerk with the electricity board, with disproportionate assets worth Rs 40 crore. In June, the Rajasthan Police arrested municipality commissioner Pankaj Prabhakar, along with a grade four employee, for fleecing a man continuously over six months to approve the construction of each floor of his house. Yograj Borkar, 59, of Nagpur had just six months to retire. But the official of the agriculture department walked into a trap set by CBI and was caught early this month while accepting a bribe of Rs 10,000. His forte was withholding certificates for import of agricultural goods.Much of the action in Chennai is in and around the scenic East Coast Road (ECR), with its special economic zones, malls, resorts, art studios, beaches and hotels. It is where the police regularly unleash 'anti-criminal' drives on weekends, rounding up drunken drivers, sellers of pirated movies and general revellers. College student Ravi Kumar complains that this is where he and his girlfriend were stopped one evening. ""The policeman threatened to call our parents if we did not pay Rs 20,000."" To others like architect R. Seshadri, the rising demand for swanky apartments on ECR, among the executives of multinational companies, has further made it a den of bribery. ""To approve a house plan, officials of the Stamps and Registration department regularly demand Rs 35,000-50,000 as bribe,"" she says.For every life event-death, birth, marriage, illness, travel, retirement-there is an outstretched palm waiting to be topped up. In April this year, an NRI youth was cut down in the bloom of life by a road accident in Kochi, Kerala. As his grieving parents struggled to make sense of their loss, a free-for-all frenzy of greed caught up with them: The police demanded Rs 15,000 to speed up the death certificate. The hospital staff asked for Rs 5,000 for alleged extra attention, without receipt, of course. Even the crematorium refused to accept the body without a facilitation fee of Rs 5,000. After paying smaller bribes for numerous other formalities, the parents finally went back home to Dubai, with the suspicion that corruption in India was a way of life-and death.The complainants of I Paid A Bribe reveal the undercover rate chart: If you want a birth certificate for your newborn, be ready to be 'congratulated' by municipal officers. But once they start asking you for celebratory sweets, take it as the cue to hand over Rs 500 (daughters often get a discount). For a marriage certificate, the officers are likely to be more brusque. The agents sitting nearby are likely to facilitate the job, for anything between Rs 200-Rs 1,000, depending on how fast you want it. The going rate for some items and services is as follows: Rs 100 for traffic violation, Rs 200-500 for passport verification, Rs 500 for LPG gas connection, Rs 600 for a driving licence, Rs 200 for parking, Rs 50-Rs 200 for lodging an FIR, Rs 2,000 for drunken driving, Rs 5,000 for property registration, Rs 5 lakh for enrolling in a medical college, Rs 1 lakh for a public sector job.India Today launched its own investigations into how to grease a palm: Chock-a-block with people and stalls, selling everything from pins to number plates, it's an effort to walk up the lane to the red Victorian building on Beltala Road in south Calcutta, the office of Public Vehicles Department. Friendly 'agents' crowd in: ""What are you looking for?"" One follows you inside, till you reach the room where the officers sit. Wait for one to look up. You are finally told that a new licence would cost Rs 1,280: ""Just buy the forms from outside or download Form 124."" The trip next day proves fruitful, armed as you are with documents, photographs. (There is no such thing as Form 124 on the official website but you have figured that out and downloaded Forms 1 and 4 instead.) An impromptu medical certificate is arranged. Finally, you get a receipt of Rs 600. But haven't you just paid Rs 1,280? ""Oh, that,"" says the agent. ""The licence costs Rs 600, I get Rs 200 and the rest goes to the officer.""Who bears the cost of bribery? The World Bank ranks it as one of the biggest barriers to a country's growth, bringing it down by 0.5 to 10 percentage points a year. ""Even in street-level bribery, where one gets things moving by shedding a little money here and there, the state loses substantial revenue,"" says economist Amiya Bagchi, director, Institute of Development Studies in Kolkata. ""Instead of going into government coffers, the money goes into the pockets of policeman."" But without rooting out big-time bribery at the top, in bureaucracy and political parties, nothing will change: ""Our democracy has become a democracy that money can buy.""To jurist Ram Jethmalani, bribery has adverse consequences for law and order. ""It is so pervasive that the whole society accepts the unacceptable as normal,"" he says. It is not just about the police or officials abusing power. ""Bribery eventually makes ordinary people get used to a certain lawless way of life."" In India, the main law concerning bribery is the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, which makes bribe-taking and giving punishable. ""But there is confusion in the law,"" says Jethmalani. By section 24 of the Act, if paid unwillingly and with the intent to expose, a bribe-giver will not be prosecuted. ""But how do you prove you were unwilling,"" he says.""This corruption is the most corrosive.Ask anyone, and they will rank it among the top three daily harassments in India,""says Swati.At I Paid a Bribe, a user can access the website, file reports,celebrate honest officials, seek advice.In the last three years, with nearly 30,000 complaints, it is fast becoming the citizen's tool to fight bribery. Not just in India but across 12 countries, from Kenya to Ukraine. ""The ultimate goal is for citizens to influence policy.What's the road ahead? Former chief economic adviser Kaushik Basu argues for a clear immunity of the bribe-giver, with the bribe money being returned, in a 2011 Ministry of Finance working paper (Why, for a Class of Bribes, the Act of Giving a Bribe should be Treated as Legal). ""It will be in the interest of the bribe-giver to expose this act of corruption. And the bribe-taker will not want to take the bribe."" But not everyone is convinced. To Gupta, a modern democracy runs on trust. ""The big pay-off from institutional as well as interpersonal trust leads to better governance. Bribe has no room in such a society.""Ramanathan has the last word. The Karnataka transport commissioner has used the data collected on I Paid A Bribe to reform its motor vehicle department, one of the most abused on the website till then. New technology has been introduced to whittle down transactions and make the business transparent. ""Urban middle classes, who are exposed to piecemeal bribery the most, are angry,"" she says. ""They are actively making choices about the future,"" she says. It's the beginning of a journey with a clear destination.It was over a coffee-table chat one evening in Berkeley, US, that the idea took root. Social entrepreneurs Swati Ramanathan, 49, and husband Ramesh had left cushy careers in the US in search of an Indian Dream.But it was the all-pervasive, petty bribery, what they call 'retail' bribe, that was tiring them out: What does one do as a citizen? Is there a silver bullet that could work? Swati came up with the idea of starting a 'platform' for the common man: ""Why not a website where people can anonymously report their experience?"" Friend and corporate boss, Sridar Ayengar, instantly promised the first investment. On August 15, 2010, I Paid A Bribe took off, under Janaagraha, the NGO Ramanathans had started in 2001 in Bangalore."
123,Naina Sahni murder: Act of barbarism,[],2013-06-25 15:02:02,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"Sushil Sharma: The accused Sushil Sharma: The accused
Ashoka Road at night is eerie in its uncommon quiet. Part of the capital's bustling city centre during the day, the tree-lined road is deserted by night, traffic reduced to a trickle, the streetlights adding a sinister touch to the shadows. And so, a plume of smoke spiralling out of a fenced-off hotel area at 11 p.m. attracts little attention.
Yet, as if on cue, an anonymous woman screams. A police constable hears her and decides to investigate the cause of the smoke and leaping flames. What he finds would rock the capital the next morning. A body being burnt in a restaurant tandoor. Murder most foul.
The tandoor at Bagia restaurant: The scene The tandoor at Bagia restaurant: The scene
The macabre story of how 29-year-old Naina Sahni was murdered and then burnt in a restaurant's tandoor has, in the week following the murder, acquired a bizarre texture as it scraped off the seamier side of Delhi politics. What deepened the mystery were the conflicting autopsy reports.
A massive manhunt was launched to find Naina's husband, the former Delhi Youth Congress(I) president and the prime accused - Sushil Sharma. Finally, surrendering in Bangalore nine days later, his head shaved, he would say he knew nothing about the murder as he had left Delhi on a ""pilgrimage"". And later, when he called it a ""political conspiracy"" inspired by his most bitter rival, Indian Youth Congress(I) chief Maninderjit Singh Bitta, it was clear that there was a lot more to come.
Once brought back to Delhi, Sushil, according to reports, began to sing to the police. ""He categorically told us that he had in fact murdered his wife,"" says a senior police officer investigating the crime. From Bitta and a political conspiracy, he shifted his stand to say that he was infuriated with Naina because of her ""affairs"".
He has reportedly named two persons - one a young Central minister, the other an older former minister who was relieved of his charge a while ago. Yet police officers are sceptical. As one of them said: ""He will be spinning a lot of such stories the next few days to confuse us or change the charge from murder to manslaughter.""
Whether Sushil does so or not, many questions remain unanswered. Was he the one who committed the crime? Or was he the victim of a larger political conspiracy as he alleges? There is evidence to indicate that the couple had a strained relationship. Did Sushil fly into a fit when he discovered that Naina was planning to leave him and migrate to Australia?
From the start, the case was never going to be easy for the police. The charred body, with both legs severed below the knee and arms cut below the elbow, was first identified by Matloob Karim, Naina's former lover and a Youth Congress(I) activist. ""I identified it by the structure of the nose and the way she did her hair,"" he said.
The first post-mortem report said that Naina had died of ""excessive bleeding"" and was probably unconscious when she was cut up. The autopsy also found alcohol in her stomach. Dissatisfied with the first post-mortem - it failed to establish whether her body was dismembered before or after her death - the Delhi Police asked for a more detailed second autopsy.
Dramatically, the second autopsy report completely negated the first one by saying that Naina was shot twice. Crucially, doctors conducting the second autopsy performed an X-ray. ""We found evidence of two bullet wounds-one in the skull and one in the neck,"" says Dr Bharat Singh, one of the experts who carried out the autopsy. This fits in with the discovery of a. 32 shell by the police in the couple's Gole Market flat. Sushil's licenced revolver has been seized and ballistic tests are on to determine whether this is the murder weapon.
The police believe that the murder took place in the Gole Market flat, following which Sushil took her body to the tandoor. There are telltale signs of the body being dragged down from the second-floor flat, the police claim. Besides other things, a blood-soaked men's underwear was also recovered from the bathroom. Police are now trying to determine whether the body was chopped or if the intensity of the flames in the tandoor severed her limbs. ""Severe heat can dismember the body,"" adds Dr Singh.
The grotesque murder really came to light with the scream of a woman - an elderly vegetable vendor. Constable Ahmad Nazir Kunju, walking his beat, had already investigated the fire. Trying to enter the open-air Bagia restaurant in the low-budget ITDC-run Ashok Yatri Niwas hotel, he was intercepted, according to the police, by Sushil who told him they were burning old election posters.
Kunju left, but decided to check again when he heard the vendor scream ""Fire!"". This time, he jumped the hotel wall and saw two men fanning an unusually large fire over a tandoor with scraps of paper and wood. Edging closer, he saw what appeared to be a human torso sticking out of the tandoor. ""I felt my hair stand on end,"" says Kunju. Quickly dousing the flames, he found it was a charred body with the skin on the lower part all melted away.
The victim: Naina Sahni: scraping the seamier side of Delhi politics The victim: Naina Sahni: scraping the seamier side of Delhi politics
The police say that by the time more personnel arrived, Sushil had escaped. The person who helped burn Naina's body, Bagia manager Keshav Kumar, was immediately arrested. According to the police reconstruction - based largely on Keshav's confession - Sushil, a partner in Bagia, drove up to the restaurant in his white Maruti car at 10.15 p.m. on Sunday, July 2. He rolled down his tinted car window a little, summoned Keshav and directed him to close the restaurant immediately and send the customers and staff away.
Then, Sushil asked Keshav to get a gunny bag. But Naina's body, wrapped in a bed-sheet and lying on the collapsed back seat of the car, would not fit into the bag and had to be taken inside in a tarpaulin. While Keshav stood guard, Sushil put the corpse into the tandoor. Since he ran out of ghee, Sushil sent Keshav to buy butter - Keshav returned with 500 gm. But it was not enough, and when the body was half shoved into the tandoor, Sushil added paper to help it burn.
In contrast with the first autopsy report, the second says Naina was shot twice; the police have seized Sushil's licenced revolver.
When INDIA TODAY confronted Sushil with these allegations, he denied everything, maintaining that he had left home on a ""pilgrimage"" on Sunday morning at 11 in a DLY taxi summoned by Naina. He drove to Ajmer and then to Jaipur. He says he doesn't know which temple he visited in Ajmer because it was ""late in the night"".
From Jaipur, he flew to Bombay on a Modi Luft flight and has a ticket counterfoil to prove it. From Bombay he travelled to Madras on a Jet Airways flight. It was here, he explains, that he first heard about being implicated in Naina's murder.
He immediately hired S. Anantanarayanan as his lawyer, who moved for an interim bail. After this, the lawyer and he travelled to Tirupati by car to visit the Venkateswara temple. As proof of this, Sushil has some 'prasad' and a 'prasad' ticket with him. He got his head tonsured and his moustache shaved off. By the time the two returned to Madras, a higher court had struck down the bail granted to him. Sushil and Anantanarayanan then came to Vellore and reached Bangalore to surrender before the police.
The marriage, kept under wraps by Sushil, was volatile, with rumours of extra-marital affairs and habitual domestic violence. Sushil and Naina thrived on ambition-and connections.
Several student leaders and acquaintances describe Sushil as a brash, brazen man. Born in a lower middle-class family - his father was a bank clerk who moved up to become deputy manager - Sushil emerged as a political leader during the turbulent days following the Emergency. He was caught in the transitional phase of a scarred Congress party - senior leaders were deserting an apparently sinking ship with the leadership being assumed by young firebrands led by Sanjay Gandhi.
Sushil was nicknamed ""chakumaar"" because of his habit of slashing posters of rival student leaders on campus. Later, he even carried a licensed .32 revolver and was known to abduct political rivals. He acquired brief notoriety when he assaulted a DCP - a case still being fought in the Delhi High Court. In a flash, Sushil had made his mark in Delhi's student politics - and his subsequent rise was meteoric.
From being the students' union president of Delhi University's Satyawati College in 1977, his connections in the party propelled him to the coveted post of Delhi Pradesh Youth Congress(I) chief in 1989: Union Minister of State for Sports Mukul Wasnik, then the all-India Youth Congress(I) chief, is said to have received a phone call in Pyongyang - where he was attending a youth conference - from the party high command, ordering him to immediately appoint Sushil as his Delhi chief.
Once entrenched, Sushil began to make his presence felt in the Delhi political scene. When Ramesh Chennithala, an MP and former Youth Congress(I) chief, fell out with K. Karunakaran, Sushil grabbed the chance. ""He carried out a campaign against me to impress Karunakaran,"" says Chennithala. But that wasn't the only reason. Karunakaran being the AICC(I) observer for Delhi, Sushil is said to have pushed the name of Deep Chand Bandhu as the DPCC(I) chief.
""Bandhu was made by Sushil,"" says Jagdish Yadav, the current Delhi Youth Congress(I) chief. Sushil was also known to have developed close links with Delhi's movers and shakers like R.K. Dhawan, Jitendra Prasada and the controversial godman, Chandraswamy. All this added to his clout.
In hindsight, that Sushil was ambitious is beyond doubt. Having established himself as a 'dedicated' party worker in 1989-1991, Sushil, when the Congress(I) was out of power, sought a party ticket for the Lok Sabha elections - the prestigious New Delhi seat no less. Party sources say he even threatened Rajiv Gandhi with sabotaging the elections if he didn't get the ticket. 'An infuriated Rajiv threw him out of the office and ordered that he be immediately expelled,"" says Bitta. But a few weeks later, Rajiv was assassinated and Sushil continued to thrive in the party.
Yet, the mud stuck. In the Delhi assembly elections in '93, he didn't get a seat. That very year, Bitta tried hard to remove Sushil from office, which was not an easy task. ""Finally, I had to talk to the prime minister... and then it was done,"" says Bitta. But Sushil remained unfazed as money and influence continued to come easy to him.
His detractors in the Youth Congress(I) allege that Sushil, who was allowed to form his own party committee as Delhi chief, appointed more than 300 members - in violation of the rules- taking substantial ""donations"" from each. Besides, he is reported to have, in return for a ""fee"", doled out favours to small-time industrialists and government servants. Sushil's connections, for instance, are said to have helped clinch the Bagia restaurant deal, though the ITDC insists that it was above board.
And so Sushil seemed to have slipped into a comfortable routine of hobnobbing with ministers, seeking favours, making money - and sharpening his ambition. Something he shared with his wife Naina, who he had married two years ago. Sushil, though, preferred to keep their marriage under wraps. His reasoning to friends: ""I will only acknowledge the marriage once I become something.""
Sushil Sharma with Rajesh Khanna Sushil Sharma with Rajesh Khanna
As luck would have it, he hadn't accounted for his wife's own ambitions, it seems. Inquiries have revealed that Naina had close relationships with many Congress leaders, a fact resented by Sushil. Naina, who came from a background quite similar to Sushil's, was extremely interested in politics. Her father was a storekeeper in an ordnance factory, and her neighbours say she was an outspoken and confident person.
""She wasn't the type who would get dominated by her husband,"" says a neighbour. While studying in Shyama Prasad Mukherjee College in Delhi, she became the All India Girls' Convener of NSUI when Wasnik was heading the outfit. But somewhere along the way, she left politics for a while to obtain a pilot's licence. But she soon came back to politics, joining the Delhi Youth Congress as general secretary in 1989. Four years later in April, she married Sushil.

But within months of their marriage, the relationship had soured, according to associates. The police found a torn letter in the flat in which Naina writes about her frustrations with Sushil. ""We feel sex could be one of the main reasons behind their marital tension,"" says Delhi Police Commissioner Nikhil Kumar. Though the motive for the murder hasn't been established yet, according to Kumar: ""We have enough evidence to nail him.""
For his part, Sushil has alleged that he has been implicated as part of a political conspiracy and that he will soon be killed. In fact, a magistrate in Delhi, while remanding him to custody, ruled that his lawyer should be present during the interrogation sessions and even ordered that Sushil's food be tested before being given to him. Meanwhile, Sushil remains confident, even cocky. Outside the court in Delhi, he told the press: ""I have done nothing to repent."" And he had a few words for senior police officers too: ""I might have made a mistake but you must help me out of this jam.""
As far as the police are concerned, it is an open-and-shut case of murder. But they have yet to piece together the full sequence of events. Given Sushil's statements alleging a larger political dimension, what has surfaced so far may well just be the proverbial tip of the iceberg. Add to this the resolve of opposition parties to make an issue out of it in Parliament, and there is little doubt that the gruesome murder of Naina Sahni will haunt public imagination for quite some time to come.

124,"Issue Date: Apr 15, 1995",[],2013-06-20 14:12:29,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"More than anything else, this letter from her 11-year-old daughter put Priya Singh, a Delhi housewife, back on the road to sobriety. ""That was my rock-bottom. I decided that I had to do something about my alcoholism."" But after drinking heavily for almost two years - something that pushed her marriage to the brink - she knew getting back to normal wasn't going to be easy.
She visited a rehabilitation centre, and after several relapses finally succeeded in giving up alcohol altogether. Frequent attendance at the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings helped and Priya is beginning to pick up the broken pieces of her life. She is now reunited with her two children and is trying to make her marriage work.
In urban India, alcoholism has for long been regarded as a male affliction. Not any more, as psychiatrists in the country's metropolises report. What began as a trickle of female patients coming in for treatment is now a widening stream. An estimated three out of 10 alcoholics in many established clinics across the country are now women.
Unfortunately, only now is the problem being taken seriously. At the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) in Bangalore, the country's premier neurosciences research institute, around 10 female patients used to report for treatment every month just five years ago. Now, there are 30 to 35 every month and the institute has been forced to open a separate outpatient department for women alcoholics.
Explains Dr LA. Shariff, head of the Department of Psychiatric Social Welfare at NIMHANS: ""Nobody speaks or makes public this problem because, in the Indian situation, for a woman to be alcoholic is considered worse than being a prostitute or a criminal. There is social ostracism. So, the way most women cope with it is by hiding their problem.""
In Bombay, as the problem escalated, the Kripa Foundation, which has seven centres across the country for treating alcoholics and drug addicts, had to open a separate section for women. Part of the reason, according to Ossie Pereira, co-founder of the foundation, was that ""most alcoholics, men and women, haven't been able to handle sex normally. So if I had a mixed centre, I would have to start a maternity ward instead.""
And Dr D. Mohan, head of the Department of Psychiatry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), predicts that by the year 2000, overall India is likely to see one female alcoholic for every three male alcoholics - a ratio prevalent in the West today.
So, why exactly are women in India hitting the bottle in such alarming numbers? There is no clear answer. Research worldwide points a finger at a gene which could make alcoholism hereditary. Others talk of a certain percentage of people who are exposed to alcohol automatically becoming chemically dependent on it. For instance, the who estimates that one out of 25 people who drink will turn alcoholic as a result.
Part of the reason for the dramatic rise in women's dependency on alcohol is simple - they are now more exposed to alcohol socially than at any time in the recent past. It is no longer taboo for women to drink in public, and in parties it is the done thing. Confirms Rakesh Ghildiyal, Associate Professor of psychiatry at KEM, Bombay: ""Alcohol is a bigger problem among women than any other drug because it now has social sanction.""
Nowadays, three out of 10 alcoholics reporting for treatment in established clinics in Indian cities are women.
Others, like Delhi-based psychiatrist Dr Avdesh Sharma, feel that it could be modern-day problems which are driving women to alcoholism.
The most cited reason is stress. The balancing act required to keep a home and a career going has been known to take its toll. Conversely, a workaholic husband could lead to a depressed and lonely wife at home.
Rachna Sharma, 38, would agree. Three grown-up children meant more time in her hands and a loving but hopelessly busy husband had no time to fill that. The bottle provided the initial solace and then the addiction took over.
If loneliness is creeping stealthily into Indian lives as joint families - and even nuclear ones - break up, it is compounded by an increasing identity crisis faced by urbanised Indians. Are we as cool and hip as our western counterparts? Hot-shot marketing executive Sonia Malik, 40, wanted to be all that and more.
""I started drinking to deal with stress and to be in with the crowd."" The only problem was that her drinking continued well after everyone went home. And often, just as others were beginning their day - a pattern common among alcoholics.
Denial and lack of empirical data have led to the problem turning even more serious. Says Ashwini Ailawadi, an addiction counsellor in Delhi: ""We have this neat policy of denial. Indian women do not have sex, they don't have orgasms and they don't drink. We simply solve the problem by denial."" The issues a woman alcoholic faces are very different from what a man goes through - this needs to be addressed.
Her drinking is even more hidden than his, thus making it all the more difficult to detect. Says Sonia: ""I used to stay late in the office and drink secretly, but I was always very controlled in public - a woman has to be. I would fall apart the minute I reached home.""
Home, unfortunately, is not where the support system is anymore. Husbands could be alcoholics or, at the very least, the initiating party. At the other end of the scale could be an alcoholic parent hovering in the background. Rahul Khanna, 40, became the target of his wife's criticism about five years ago. Her complaint? That he drank too much.
In what she thought was an attempt at getting closer to him, Deepti, 35, too started drinking. ""We began to share a few drinks together and things began to look more cheerful."" she recalls. The cheer proved as short-lived as the fizz in a glass of beer. A truncated career and several violent fights later, the Khannas realised the severity of the problem.
Career and family life are not the only things at risk. Studies conducted in the US show that spontaneous abortions and early miscarriages are more likely to occur among alcoholic women.
Pregnant women in their first trimester are at a risk factor of 12 per cent even if they are modest drinkers. And the risk of congenital abnormalities is estimated to be as high as 32 per cent for women who are heavy drinkers. Worse, children are found to be more seriously affected by alcoholic mothers than fathers.
The problem also persists because there are no stereotypes, no target groups. And unfortunately, no safe groups either. At one end of the spectrum are groups like tribals and plantation workers, from whom come 48 per cent of women alcohol users.
Women in the weaker economic strata have always consumed alcohol. Now, there is the new addition of the middle classes, which could include anyone from a college student to a bored housewife. Says Karl Sequeria, joint director of the Bangalore-based Freedom Foundation, a rehabilitation centre: ""I find that more and more young college-going women are drinking heavily, a cause for grave concern.""
Why Treatment is Tough
Alcohol is often abused, with prescription pills making it a deadly cocktail.
Complete lack of rehabilitation centres and support groups.
Families are rarely supportive.
So, while recognition is often myopic, treatment runs into a blind alley.
Women face specific guilt trips and problems but rehabilitation centres and support groups are dominated by, and are often for, men.
Rape, manipulation and sexual baiting are all part of a woman alcoholic's routine.
With such a negative gender background, a woman with this problem finds it difficult to enter a predominantly male group. Even an immensely successful support group like AA faces this problem. There is now a crying need for separate rehabilitation centres for women, like the one NIMHANS has begun.
The silver lining to this dark cloud is that sobriety gives recovering women alcoholics an unparalleled high. Every experience is savoured with a new enthusiasm and talk of a new life.
Sonia, who was considered dead for all practical and financial reasons, is today at the centre of all family decisions. Priya is the emotional anchor for her two teenage children. Most of them further the cause of sobriety by keeping their doors open to fellow alcoholics.

All the lonely people/Where do they all come from?/All the lonely people/Where do they all belong? from the Beatles song Eleanor Rigby The bomb exploded 10 minutes after Supriya Sekhon left the bank. Later, watching the news about the series of bomb blasts which had brought Mumbai to a standstill three years ago, a chilling thought struck her.
Had she died that morning, nobody would have known. A young late-50s, she lost her husband a few years earlier. Her son, who had gone to the US to study, had stayed on and was on his way to becoming an American citizen. Her daughter was married and now lived in Australia. Sekhon often feels lonely, her long-distance chats with her grandchildren the only brief interludes in days of unrelenting monotony. But she had never felt so isolated before.
Loneliness - and its companion, alienation - social pundits often tell us is something which happens in other societies, the affluent, western ones. India, with its strong familial bonds and joint families, safety valves of religion, sticky tentacles of tradition, the emotional security of its rural life, and its tethered ambitions, is immune to this western malady, they say.
They are wrong. Loneliness is an old inhabitant of this country: whether it struck, as eminent sociologist M.N. Srinivas explains, the elderly, ""who were reduced to being verandah dwellers"", left out there to sleep and fend for themselves, or brides from traditional families suddenly catapulted into an unknown world with its iron-clad hierarchy, where even the architecture forbade any kind of social intimacy.
There could hardly be anything more poignant than the late Jennifer Kapoor's brilliant portrayal of the elderly Anglo-Indian in 36 Chowringhee Lane, particularly the last shot of her walking down a street in Calcutta on a dimly lit night, a dog following her - sole companion after all her relatives emigrated.
Newer forms of loneliness are now arriving. It is silently gnawing into the corporate achiever clocking 14-hour days in a scramble to the top; the small-town/village exile lost in the anonymity of the big city; children and adolescents unable to connect with parents caught in whirlpools of modern times; and married couples who live in separate worlds, even in the confines of a home.
""Loneliness is a consequence and concomitant of change,"" says Srinivas. As much of India hurtles to catch up with the rest of the world, the anchors of social tradition are being hauled up, freeing personal ambitions and internal brakes.
Loneliness does not always go by its name. And not being a ""disease"", there are no clinical definitions for it. Psychotherapist Akash Dharmaraj describes it as ""the lack of connectedness"". You can be alone and not lonely: loneliness sets in when even in a crowd, there is a sense of absence or loss. Dr Achal Bhagat, a psychiatrist with Delhi's Apollo Hospital, defines it as ""a symptom of depression, with alienation en route"".
Nor are there any clinical devices to measure it. But psychiatrists and counsellors in India see a marked increase. ""The proof is that of all those going to doctors, at least 25 per cent don't have any diagnostic problems, just subjective symptoms,"" explains Dr Mohan Issac, who heads the Psychiatry Department at NIMHANS in Bangalore.
""They don't come and say I am lonely. We see the indicators."" Sleeplessness, a feeling of helplessness or hopelessness, bouts of anxiety and crying spells signal loneliness. ""Generally people who feel lonely are likely to develop somataform (psychosomatic) disorders and bodily pains or neurotic problems,"" says Dr S.M. Channabasavanna, vice-chancellor, NIMHANS.
In itself, loneliness is not harmful - the creative have often wallowed in it, using it as a spur to, or catchment area for, creativity. Like filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt. ""Best creative urges come when you are alone,"" he says. ""Loneliness has such thirst. It devours everything: knowledge, alcohol, drugs, sex, fame."" But there is the other side, it is what loneliness combines with or triggers. For one, loneliness lowers immunity because it causes stress, explains Bombay-based psychiatrist Dr Ashith Seth.
And alcoholism and suicide often become its handmaidens. ""Singles bars and pubs are cropping up and people are increasingly stopping by after work,"" says Rajesh Parikh, a neuropsychiatrist attached to Jaslok Hospital in Bombay. ""The pub culture is a manifestation of loneliness.""
Especially among the growing tribe of single working people, like Delhi-based journalist V. Sushil, ""killing time to avoid returning to empty PG (paying-guest) accommodations"". ""I even stay on longer at work,"" he says. Professor Srinivas does not discount ""the role of IMFL (Indian made foreign liquor) in reconciling the elderly middle class to their heightened states of loneliness"" - usually the victims of the NRI-children-abroad syndrome and longer lifespans.
Dr Ravi Kapoor of the Institute of Advanced Studies in Bangalore sees a similar connection between loneliness and suicide. And the link is more obvious in migrants who, he says, have high suicide rates. ""The young go away to study and are from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds. Even something like different food becomes important, symbolic.""
It is during the ""stress times"" of exams that students in hostels are more prone to crack, and a few maybe driven to take their lives. Heightened competitiveness is also beginning to take its toll. The very concept of shared notes is fading away in a world where every classmate is more a rival than a friend.
But you don't need to be a doctor or psychiatrist to diagnose this spreading malaise. Just cock half an ear to FM phone-ins, tune in to any of the chat shows, hook on to party lines, or read anguished outpourings in the proliferating columns of agony aunts and uncles. The cri de coeur can be heard loud and clear.
There is a discernible need in young people for an interlocutor to communicate with others, even about the most intimate or personal matters. Even if you are just a disembodied voice drifting in ether. ""So many listeners out there want to hear you. So many start off rambling and then the floodgates open,"" says Roshan Abbas of Livewire and Balance Barabar, the phone-in programmes on FM, Delhi. ""We are like bridges for them to communicate with invisible people."" The letters he gets ""reek of loneliness"".The corporate world, where the winds of change are blowing even stronger since liberalisation, seems to have become a breeding ground for the virus. The man at the top has built an impenetrable moat round him. Colleagues are more likely to be rivals, if not enemies. Corporation heads are in the lonely position of becoming the chief by eliminating the rest, explains Dr Vasantha Patri, a counsellor and head of the Department of Psychology at Lady Sri Ram College.
""Earlier, the ascent was gradual, in a predictable manner. Now at 42, he is catapulted to the head, skipping many stages."" As he hares up, he isolates himself from his colleagues, with whom interaction was earlier fun. ""We deliberately create our own empire of loneliness,"" says Dr Channabasavanna.
Many homes are also increasingly becoming little empires of loneliness. India is now getting the fashionable maladies of the West: LTL (Living Together Loneliness). A new class of middle-aged, college-educated lonely women is emerging, and the pattern seems to cut across regions and class, according to psychiatrists and counsellors. Loneliness, they say, normally sets in about 10 to 15 years after marriage.
""My friends from college are so full of life. But I have nothing to say to them. And whenever I start talking to my husband, he says he has had a difficult day and just wants to watch television. Sometimes I wish I had never married. Sometimes I feel like running away to an ashram. I almost did once. There is something hollow inside me and I feel it is growing.""
Chandrika Ghosh, 44, the pampered daughter of a former civil servant, was a brilliant student. She was going to do a doctorate in bio-physics in the US when she fell in love with a fellow student and decided to marry. Daydreams of academic laurels were put away. Now in her 40s, Chandrika has begun to feel restless. Her elder son is studying in Canada, the younger is an undergraduate in Delhi who doesn't seem to need her anymore.
Until then women are so busy tackling husbands and in-laws and bringing up children that they barely have time to think about themselves. ""Many women come in about 10 years after their marriage with the syndrome: 'What is it all about, my life? Just producing kids and feeding hubby',"" says Dr Kapoor. It is an ineffable, acute feeling of being left behind.Time has begun to stretch before them like an endless desert. An increasing number of Dr Patri's clients are women in their 40s who come in restless and talking about an emptiness in their lives. ""There is a big void in their lives because the men have spent the last 20 years building up their businesses - all their emotions, time and energy have gone into that,"" says Dr Patri.
Their husbands are travelling more. Nurturing roles are getting shorter. Children are growing up and going away much earlier, many to emigrate and join the spreading diaspora of Indians abroad. Servants, more money, comforts and expanding leisure time leave these women with the empty-nest syndrome. ""These women are not old hags when their children leave. They still feel young and want more out of life,"" says Dharmaraj.
And one of the things women, working or not, increasingly want is meaningful conversation, to connect. In traditional joint families, the women of the house may have been daggers drawn, but there were certain bonds of emotional intimacy. Cooking, gossiping or fighting, they were at least connecting.
Men and women often speak a different language and about different things, and such intimacy does not normally exist between them. Today's woman, home alone in a nuclear family, not only has just those four walls for company, but perceives an additional one: an impenetrable wall of silence coming up between her husband and her.
In today's pressure-cooker world, a large number of men are coming home exhausted, itching to ""switch off "", explains Anuradha Patel, a psychotherapist. ""The experience of work is one of continuous demand. So when they come home, they fear more demands,"" she says.
Hence the immediate switching on to inanimate, ""undemanding"" things: television, Internet, golf, a glass of beer or a thriller. The silence becomes groaningly loud, one more brick to that wall of silence, pushing the wife further back into her area of loneliness.
For working wives, it's not endless time which trips them into loneliness. It is not being able to talk about their problems at work. Even after the husband has finished his litany of complaints about his work and his list of accomplishments of the day.
There is a growing isolation even within families, as each member goes his own way in increasingly busy lives. Focus has shifted from the family to the individual. Leisure activities take people further away from each other, whether it is the telephone and television or computers and Internet for the more affluent.
Left out in the cold, and perhaps the most lonely, are the growing number of elderly people. Ironically, as their numbers grow-courtesy modern medicine and better standards of living-the more invisible or marginal they become in a society on the move.
To cliched images of the elderly clustering together in parks are newer ones of them shoved into forgotten corners of homes, and in case of a growing number from middle-class backgrounds, into old-age homes. ""They can cope with their physical discomforts. But what they find painful is this feeling of desertion,"" says Sister Carunia, warden at St Mary's Home, an old-age home near Delhi.
""We have an old lady here who has been waiting for her son for the past three days. She has stopped talking to people, and her asthma problem, which was under control, has suddenly taken a turn for the worse.""
How do you cope with loneliness? Dharmaraj says that it stems from a lack of self-esteem, a lonely person being somebody who is essentially unhappy with his own company. She advises her clients to take up activities like pottery, gardening or exercise. Or even to help others: social work has helped many of her clients get over their loneliness by giving them the satisfaction of having contributed to society.
""I no longer have the strength to visit my friends. My nephews and nieces used to come on Sundays. But everybody is so busy now. I don't even want to see my children's faces today. I have become invisible for them.""
Ved Prakash Khanna, 74, started from scratch after Partition. His motor-parts business flourished in New Delhi. His four sons and two daughters were well-settled. The sons and their wives lived with him in their three-storied home in south Delhi. But things began to change after he handed his business over to them. Whatever communication he had with his family broke down completely when his wife died. Slowly, he began to retreat-eating all his meals in his room, alone. And his grandchildren, who used to stop by and talk to him, gradually stopped coming. Left alone in his room, surrounded by photographs of his wife, Khanna says he often contemplates taking his life.
Collective rituals, explains Farida Lambay, vice-president of Nirmala Niketan College of Social Work in Bombay, is another way out of the impasse. ""Dussehra used to be limited to Calcutta, garba to a specific community. And now it has all become more cosmopolitan with disco dandiyas. Dance and music are therapeutic in overcoming loneliness."" Pubs and discos are all part of what psychiatrists like Dr Kapoor term, ""healing rituals"".
While the more affluent go to meet others in clubs or other public places, the middle class is often marooned by lack of funds. Aware of this problem, several housing colonies have started ""collective"" programmes.
Some of the high-rise buildings in Mumbai have even introduced days for inhabitants to socialise-all in an attempt to inculcate the feeling of community, which has almost disappeared with the eclipse of the mohalla culture, and to some extent of the emotional safety-net of the extended family.
""I don't like to think. It makes me sad. I feel like the whole city has rushed by leaving me behind. It is difficult adjusting to so many changes, and then you have nobody you can share these feelings with. I would like to settle down, get married, have children. But who cares?""
Radha, 28, has been working as a maid in New Delhi for the past seven years. A pretty tribal from Chota Nagpur, Radha has her own room and every Sunday off. Having picked up some English, she even watches Santa Barbara with the family. And yet, there is an inexplicable pain within her. Watching women walking by with their children makes her feel even worse. She wonders if she will ever marry and have a home of her own. To fill those long hours, she lingers over her chores. Some nights you can even hear her washing clothes well past 11.
Bringing the family out of its siege by the pressures of modern life and the emphasis on the self and achievement, is essential to combat loneliness, according to Dr Lambay. ""Youth and adolescents are at a loose end. Parents need to spend more time with them,"" she says, adding that they need ""more social activities, more information, less competition. Youths should feel they are contributing, not just receiving.""
Most poignant perhaps is the loneliness of the migrant, the small-towner or villager who has left his wife and come to the city, says psychoanalyst Udayan Patel. Rajesh had come to a big city from a small town in Gujarat. Double-decker buses, lifts and the high rises made him uneasy. He had one recurring dream.
He would be stretched out on the floor and these vertical masses, tall buildings, would come towards him, almost like buildings with faces. Inevitably, he would get high fever the next morning. But even as Rajesh dwells in the realm of his nightmares, others are learning to cope.
As silence descends on Kemps Corner in Mumbai, you can hear untrained voices singing a little repertoire of folk ditties in a thick rustic dialect - songs of ripening wheat and bucolic harvests, of frolic in the fields and love under the stars. The singers are cooks and domestic workers from Gujarat and Rajasthan, displaced sons of the soil trying to find their rustic roots on the hard concrete pavement of this indifferent city.
This daily bonding session helps ease the sense of alienation. From time to time they break into desultory chatter about their jobs before returning once again to the subjects closest to their hearts: wives and children and doting old parents, in a faraway village called home.

126,A tale of two cities,[],2013-06-03 07:45:46,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"It is a pity we are aping the worst of West.
I've been warning against this for a while. Then we go and do it again. Why does an ancient civilisation like ours have to blindly ape the West? As we move forward in the 21st century, why don't we turn to our own rich heritage for guidance? Meanwhile, the moral pollution unleashed on us by these puritanical societies, like the United States, continues to cloud our vision. This foreign assault is eroding our moral fabric and putting our children on the road to hell. And yet we continue to ape the West.
Contradictions
In January this year, I put up a link to a New York Times story on my Facebook wall. The story spoke of a Brooklyn shopkeeper who comes home after shutting her store, and is about to settle into bed, when she gets a call from an unknown man who identifies himself as belonging to the neighbourhood 'modesty committee'. He is concerned that the mannequins in her store's window, used to display women's clothing, ""might inadvertently arouse passing men and boys."" He tells her to do the neighbourhood a favour and remove it from her window.
The anonymous caller signs off by saying, ""We're trying to safeguard our community."" This, for the record, is a community of orthodox Hasidic Jews that lives in Brooklyn, New York. A former colleague of mine immediately posted a warning: ""Shhh. Quiet. Indians will get ideas."" Six months later, it happened. Last week, BMC councillors unanimously passed a proposal to ban lingerie-clad mannequins in Bombay because it might lead men to commit 'wrong acts'. It's hard to imagine what an inanimate plastic body in lingerie can do to a man's imagination, unless he is, of course, a necrophiliac of sorts.
One wonders what they think about Khajuraho, which offers more than the mannequin's frozen, immobile sexuality, and leaves nothing to the imagination. There's actual action in these graphic sculptures: bestiality, homosexuality and orgies. What's more, all these engravings have been made on the walls of temples. Maybe we should cover these walls with tarpaulin too. But before we do that, we should conduct a study as to what influence these carvings have had on the young of Khajuraho. Are the young men here more prone to rape and bottom-pinching than the men in Bombay and Delhi? I'd reckon not.
One actor/ activist type has suggested that the ban is justified because the thousands who come to the city in search of livelihood, come from conservative areas far removed from the liberal culture of the metropole. We should be mindful of what they can 'handle' and what they can't. This arrogantly presumes that liberal sexuality is only a preserve of India's English-speaking elite. Bhojpuri, to take one example, is abundant in sexually explicit songs.
This argument also puts the onus of 'responsible' dressing on the city dweller. By this rationale, Londoners should dress not according to their fashions, but according to the conventions of the various immigrants entering their city: Afghanis, Indians, Saudi Arabians. Follow this and very soon London will be overrun with saris and burkhas. And I thought girls from around the world go to London to become London girls, not to pull London girls down to their tastes.
Also, we shouldn't forget that while it is our duty to protect children, society also exists for adults, not just for impressionable toddlers. Lingerie is an aid to sex. In fact, if we don't allow adults access to it, very soon there might be no impressionable toddlers left to shield from the terrible world outside.
Slippery slope
Meanwhile, we continue to look to Brooklyn for inspiration. After mannequins, the moral mafia there went after ladies sitting on their porches or going about their gardening in housecoats. Days after the proposal banning mannequins was passed in Bombay, councillors have demanded a ban on ingerie ads altogether. This is classic slippery slope. Watch out. Housewives in maxis could be next. Here, in Delhi, in a separate yet similar move, we have seen an attempt by Delhi Metro officials to prevent drunks from boarding trains. Fortunately, the move has been shelved for now. Breathanalysers though will continue to be used on platforms as 'deterrents'.
Solution
While the limit for drinking and driving is fixed at two units of alcohol, we don't know what the government-specified limit for walking and sitting is yet. I'm sure they're working on it. Several people have already been challaned not for drunken misbehaviour, but merely for having red eyes or reeking of alcohol or swaying while walking. Carrying sealed bottles of alcohol on trains is also banned, causing immense inconvenience to office-goers. In this respect at least, Bombay has been the liberal city. You can drink as much and board the local.
By heavy public demand, a liquor store was opened right in the Churchgate station subway so that people returning from office don't have to go looking for a quarter after work, but can, instead, pick it up on the way to their train. Here's my proposition: instead of aping the West, why don't we look to each other for guidance. The Bombay councillors should come to Delhi's Palika Bazaar, blend in with the young couples and precocious schoolboys, and enjoy the lifesize rubber dolls and lingerie on display. The Delhi Metro officials could take a leaf out of Bombay's local train system and lift the ban on carrying liquor on board. Like in Churchgate, they should open liquor vends at major stations. We could start with Central Secretariat."

A Mail Today investigation has found out that foreign drug cartels are smuggling in thousands of kilograms of narcotics through Delhi's porous borders even as the anti-narcotics forces grope in the dark for leads.
On April 3 this year, the Delhi Police seized drugs worth Rs 15 crore from a storehouse in the Capital. Two Myanmar nationals, two persons from Mizoram and one from Delhi were found in possession of 140 kg of pseudoephedrine tablets and 50 kg of pseudoephedrine powder. The consignment was to be smuggled out to Myanmar through Mizoram and brought back after being processed into a consignment of high-end party drugs such as Ecstacy, ICE and Crystal Meth.
A few days later, another international drug cartel in possession of several kilograms of psychotropic drugs and fake currency notes, was busted by the Delhi Police.
Low on priority
A senior Delhi Police officer, on condition of anonymity, said better financial prospect in the national Capital is attracting new narcotics suppliers from within and outside the country.""Almost all the drugs seized by law enforcement agencies are smuggled into the Capital through airports or by surface transport. While everyone knows about this, we have been told to focus on our top priority, which is to go after terrorism and not drugs,"" said the officer.He said most officers, from the narcotics branch and the special cell division of the Delhi Police, are hesitant to go after the source of drugs because not many understand the provisions of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS).
The officer said several precautionary clauses reserved in the NDPS to prevent unlawful arrests actually invoke fear among the police, who haven't been sufficiently trained in antinarcotics laws. ""Many a time our investigation comes to a deadend because no drugs are found from the suspects' place. There have been cases when NDPS has questioned the policeman's intent of going after a suspect. This creates trouble for all investigating officers,"" said the officer.
""As soon as we seize the supply, chaos ensues. Rate of drugs spikes, suppliers adulterate narcotics with impurities because of which the number of fatalities also shoots up. Being resource-constrained, we try to nab mainly the sources of drugs and leave the footmen alone,"" said a narcotics officer.
Mail Today investigation also found that a 'set' comprising certain tablets along with a syringe can be procured over the counter for Rs 80. Chemists report the stock as having been misplaced or damaged due to exposure to heat.
While the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has just 70 men for the city, Delhi Police's narcotics division is just 55-personnel strong. There are also an increasing number of children who are being absorbed into the drug trade.
""Children are first being addicted to drugs and then being forced to work for the traffickers,"" said Vinod Kumar Tikoo, member of National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR).
Addicts who are trying to find their way back
He had a family business in Tilak Nagar before he started snorting smack with friends. It started as a party recreation but soon changed into a regular habit.Luthra had inherited a building and store-houses from his ancestral business of agricultural. As an addict he began selling his property, his wife's jewellery and their savings off to buy smack.A smack addict consumes around one gram or less smack each day, but Luthra's addiction had peaked to more than five grams every single day, inform his doctors.The three friends who passed on the habit to him died shortly afterwards from drug overdose. After 20 years of snorting heroin Luthra says he's finally given up. It has been one year and he hasn't touched the powder yet.Kumar started abusing medicines as soon as the girl he had eloped with refused to marry him.A few days after their escapade the girl returned to Delhi to join her family. Kumar took recourse to cannabis, alcohol, painkillers and later heroin to help him overcome the grief.Drugs, as he later realised, distanced him further from his former beau and the vicious cycle of inebriation reduced the 21-year-old Kumar to a 40 kg skeleton. Today, Kumar commutes 50 km once every week from his home in Mongolpuri to NDDTC(National Drugs Dependence Centre) in Ghaziabad. He hasn't consumed drugs for the past four months.He has been addicted to tobacco, both smoking and chewing and paint thinners for the past two years.He started consuming alcohol one and a half years ago. He has also been addicted to weed for the past one year, and recently started heroin.He is only 16 years old.His family based in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, found out about the addiction when Bittoo thrashed his brother who demanded to sniff what his elder brother was sniffing.Bittoo's mother says their family was ostracised, and her husband gave up on their son when they found out about his addiction.The child in a strained, hoarse voice now claims to have rid himself of all addictions.Like many youths, Singh got addicted to drugs as a result of peer pressure.Heroin which was being smuggled from Pakistan was easily available in his village at Wagah Border.His grandfather was a senior retired military man, and his father and mother were employed in the service sector.Addiction forced him to drop out of college and spend his days looking for money to buy drugs. When cash dried up Singh fled to Dubai and started bootlegging liquor there. Police found him and deported him back to India. He is now trying to get back on the path of recovery. His application to Punjab police force has been accepted."

""You want the police to catch us?"" guffaws Manjit, as the others rumble gleefully like Jabba the Hut, ""Tonight we party. Coming?""
Sorry, got to go. It's March 31, 1998. Haryana will party past midnight. The rural and the poor because they can drink legally. Their families because this lot can drink safely, if easily.
And city slickers in Karnal, Ambala, and Sonepat, the plush developments in Gurgaon and the industrial belt of Faridabad, who drink as a culture, as entertainment and because they are with it. And I want to be there.
Since Chief Minister Bansi Lal cracked down with prohibition 21 months ago, he has lost the state money - about Rs 1,200 crore in excise revenue. He also lost the support of the very people - farmers and the poor - he rode to power on. Raising water and electricity bills and bus fares took care of that.
DONS DIG IN: As people celebrate their first legal drink, Kulwant Singh (seated, right) and his partners from UP score big with bids: a record Rs 51crore for Gurgaon district. DONS DIG IN: As people celebrate their first legal drink, Kulwant Singh (seated, right) and his partners from UP score big with bids: a record Rs 51crore for Gurgaon district.
The art of how not to enforce prohibition in a dry state surrounded by five wet ones took care of the rest. His party alliance got slammed in the Lok Sabha polls, after which the decision to reverse prohibition was taken. And the buzz is that prohibition or permission, he may lose the next assembly elections. Even with the renewed flow of funds: the licence fee for all vends fetched Rs 491 crore, with more to come through excise collections.
As a forum of tipplers of Kalyat town in Kaithal district mailed a 30-m-long thank you note to Bansi Lal, another forum in Rohtak burnt his effigy, for lifting prohibition. April 1. All Fool's Day. The joke seems to be on him.
It was the art of how not to enforce the dry law, with five ""wet"" states around.
Strangely, party-time is the day before. It will take a couple of days before vends are dressed up, more for supplies to pour in, even more before restaurants get permits to serve alcohol, from the basic Deluxe dhaba at Ambala (famous for its hen logo and catch-line ""Meet Me Anywhere But Eat Me Here) to the swank Fireball discotheque near Gurgaon.
Meanwhile, at Jharmari, barely half a kilometre across the border in Punjab towards Chandigarh, Harjeet Singh and Paramvir Chauhan drink themselves silly at a small dhaba next to a liquor shop, knowing that from the next day, they, like the 30-odd out-of-theirmind drinkers, won't be back.
Gladly. Harjeet, who owns three meat shops, blew a lot of what he earned commuting, drinking, and to theft - once he lost his scooter and numerous times his day's earnings as he lay comatose on the grass outside, much like the occupants of a dozen or so cars, scooters and tractors, all with Haryana number plates.
Harjeet and Paramvir, an officer in Haryana's Irrigation Department, talk turkey. His wife will be happier now, says Harjeet, he can drink at home as before, it's cheaper, safer and within limits. And Paramvir recounts something that is always at the core of a ban, proven recently in Andhra Pradesh and continually in Gujarat: if you are prevented from doing something, you will do everything to do it. And more.
""I used to drink once in a while. Now I drink half a bottle a day."" Paramvir starts weeping. ""We made children smuggle for us. We went that low."" He promises to be back to drinking occasionally from Day One, which the wits from Kaithal suggested to the chief minister be called Liquor Day. ""Now it will be better, won't it?"" sniffles Paramvir, ""What do you think?""
Yes, sure, I mumble - what else can I say? - and look around the filthy eatery. The most prominent noise is belligerent, back-slapping conversation - "" Drink, mother@$*#&*! Masti karo, have fun!"" - and the most prominent sign somewhat more sobering: ""Those who vomit will be fined Rs 20"".
Those who did, and couldn't pay up got 20 with a shoe or whatever was handy. Delinquent in Haryana, disciplined in Punjab, about as staggering a bit of irony as any.
Who knows what was right or wrong in the end, I wonder as we drive past golden wheat harvests on the bone-jarring road from Kaithal to Rohtak, in a mainly political exercise that has been stood on its head? Bansi Lal hasn't been hit harder, or been embarrassed more, in years.
REALITY CHECK: Keorak village chief Satya Devi learns how a ban hurts; others protest its lifting in Rohtak REALITY CHECK: Keorak village chief Satya Devi learns how a ban hurts; others protest its lifting in Rohtak
In some parts of Haryana, the code for a full bottle was Bansi Lal, for a half, it was Surender Singh, his son, one of the few from the political combine of the BJP and Bansi Lal's Haryana Vikas Party who was elected to the Lok Sabha this time on account of his probooze plank.
That's just part of the story. On the first day of prohibition on July 1, 1996, a Haryana police sub-inspector was arrested and suspended for disturbing public peace - drunk. Two others drove down to Andhra Pradesh, then ""dry"", to fit a Tata Sierra meant for Bansi Lal with electronic jammers to counter remote-controlled explosives.
They set off something else: both were caught at a random police check carrying alcohol. On August 2 that year, a day before Bansi Lal's ""the state will enter a new era of happiness"" speech in Rohtak, seven people died and 35 were seriously injured drinking killer hooch, often little more than a rough mixture of molasses, tree bark, water and urea to quicken the fermentation process.
Other gems: women pretending to be pregnant, a ploy to hide pouches of country liquor brought in from neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, men wearing padded jackets in the middle of summer, and children carrying booze in their schoolbags. Garbage collectors would snitch to the police when they saw empty bottles in the bag - and often, share the booty with the police.
The milkman would bring, along with the milk, liquor sometimes spiked with medicine to make buffaloes give more milk. The kick almost killed him one night, says Chander Prakash, ""Desperate, I still drank.""
So he did, and did so many others that the police record reads total number of persons arrested: 1,08,776. Cases registered: 98,699. Bailable offences: 38,818. Non-bailable offences (more than two bottles of liquor or three bottles of beer): 59,881. Vehicles impounded - even if the person driving was bailed out, the vehicle was impounded - including Haryana road transport buses: 7,093.
So far, there is no decision to drop charges. There are no orders from the brass, says Satbir Singh, station house officer at Faridabad N.I.T. police station, about what to do with those who have cases against them, the impounded cars - his backyard has a few - or the confiscated liquor.
All he knows is that he will paint over the letter box near his office, identical to scores of others elsewhere, which was a snitch-box: people could come and leave anonymous tips. Now, it will become a general complaints box.
All across Haryana, hoardings that blared Sharab Mukt Haryana (Liquor Free Haryana) have come down, repainted with ""Don't Drink and Drive"" slogans. One, near the Punjab border near Ambala, trumpets a Rs 2,400 crore World Bank loan for power.
The shift is less smooth elsewhere. Keorak, a dirt-poor village with a population of 20,000 - ""but 10,000 votes,"" as village elder Hari Singh stresses, used this time against Bansi Lal - scored in 1995 for two reasons.
It elected its first female sarpanch, or chief, Satya Devi. And she immediately set about campaigning for prohibition, a call that was taken up by other villages. ""I was upset then,"" says the tough-talking lady, ""And I'm even more upset now.""
She and others like her harped that village folk were wasting away with easy, cheap availability of liquor, with little money left over for the family, and he was quick to spot an electoral opportunity: prohibition. He won, and then within weeks, it all went to pieces.
In Keorak, ""every 10th house had an illegal still"", says Satya Devi. ""We were worse off than before, and we even turned our children into thieves."" She's equally bitter when she and a knot of elders discuss a local constable who has bought himself a house, another who bought 15 shops at one shot.
Across the state, ""Liquor Free Haryana"" signs have changed to ""Don't Drink and Drive"".
And the money, about -Rs 10 crore, that is estimated to have been spent in adjoining Patiala district of Punjab by people from Kaithal. ""Drink,"" she cynically tells the gathering, ""at least you won't drink rubbish, become thieves, at least the money will stay in Haryana.""
Have you learnt your lesson, I ask her. She fixes me with a glare like the one another lady fixed me in Lakhan Majra, a few hours drive away, as she passed by a newly opened liquor shop clutching her baby.
Are you happy, I had asked that lady, at least this way you know it's safe? She looked at a teenage boy coming out of the shop, opening the cap of his half bottle of country liquor as grown men laughed and pointed at him. ""Happy?"" she pinned me with a contemptuous look. ""You dress like a sahib, but you talk like an idiot.""
There's always that. Me and Bansi Lal, an unlikely brotherhood."
129,We're like this only,[],2013-02-28 15:00:16,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"Wham, bam, thank you, man - well, sir. N. Chandrababu Naidu, Andhra Pradesh's cybernetic chief minister put on a spunky laser show to kickstart the 30th International Film Festival of India (IFFI '99) in Hyderabad. The lasers even sketched the man himself on a giant wall in bold electric green. And Naidu boasted of Hyderabad as a ""happening city"" - the best stopover between Europe and China. But when the lasers died out and the festival began, it had all been nothing more than virtual reality.
Godmother Shabana reigns Shabana reigns Reality Bite
Forget the next century, we were almost back at the turn of this one when the projections began. Shekhar Kapur, whose film Elizabeth opened the festival, squirmed in his seat: the audio sounded butchered and the surface of the painted wall serving as the screen kept showing through. Not to talk of unintended fade-outs. It got worse for the rest.
The much-hyped Godmother - prima don(na) Shabana Azmi was good enough, but she was certainly no Mother India for the 90s as she made out - suffered beyond redemption: the projection spilled out of the screen, it was seldom in focus and the soundtrack crackled, at times so loud the ear drums were in danger. Apparently the projectionist kept moving the projector with a shovel-like appliance to keep the images within the frame. And where were the festival authorities for what was supposed to launch Shabana's retrospective?
Naidu sells Hyderabad as the new Mecca of films Naidu sells Hyderabad as the new Mecca of films
They were missing, too, for Piyush Jha's. So miffed was the young director at the callous attitude of the officials of the Directorate of Film Festivals that he stopped the screening of the film barely five minutes after it had begun - in protest against the failure of the officials to introduce him in the customary manner before the start of the film at such festivals. It was resumed after a great deal of persuasion.
Where were those officials? Obviously out for dinner. Glasses flew like missiles and chairs were smashed when the Telugu film industry, after the initial tantrums over the absence of Telugu films in the Indian Panorama, hosted a dinner at the Annapurna Studios. The row started when it was announced that alcohol would not be served after 10 p.m. - barely an hour after the bar opened.
Nobody tried to stop the free-for-all: the well-known producers and directors were busy elsewhere, dancing attendance on the state's Home and Cinematography Minister A. Madhava Reddy. Worse, some securitymen believed to be part of the minister's entourage carried away bottles: no wonder liquor did not flow like the Krishna. And in the melee late-comers went hungry. The lucky ones found their way to the opposition court: it was open house at the ubiquitous Congress MP T. Subbarami Reddy's. The best place for those looking for legendary Hyderabadi cuisine and something more spirited to wet their throats.
Case of the Missing Beard: Festival favourite Shekhar Kapur with wife Suchitra Krishnamoorthy Case of the Missing Beard: Festival favourite Shekhar Kapur with wife Suchitra Krishnamoorthy Hairy Story
Shekhar Kapur's beard - rather his missing beard - was the talking point of the festival. It also gave him unwanted anonymity. When the car with him and his wife, singer-actress Suchitra Krishnamoorthy, passed by, one of the star-hunters amassed along the route to the Public Gardens peeped in and waved on the car with disappointment: ""Isme to koi nahin hai (There's nobody in here).""
And then continued looking for Shabana, Venkatesh or Dev Anand. Nandita Das, whose face has become familiar after the Fire hullabaloo, had better luck. But when a film buff saw her ambling along like any ordinary mortal, he said, ""She won't get roles if she goes around with friends."" Stars have movable courtiers. Lesson: Das should get a retinue and Kapur should stop shaving.
Now Cinemabad
The festival's actually a promo for selling Hyderabad as the country's new film mecca. And did they bite. So impressed by what he heard and saw on what is only his fourth visit, the evergreen Dev Anand who inaugurated the festival took a beaming Naidu by surprise and told him that his next movie would be made there. Half of Bollywood, Amitabh Bachchan included, were on location. And on cue, Naidu, when asked for space to open the office of the National Film Development Corporation, readily offered to provide 2.5 acres to put up a complex with a screening facility.
Husain's Cinema Ghar: museum mania Husain's Cinema Ghar: museum mania Husain's Saga
Unlike the Scarlet Pimpernel, you see him here, you see him there, you see him everywhere. Cinema Ghar: Husain Museum of Art and Cinema opened hours before IFFI '99 did. Naturally the stars glittered here: Shabana, Madhuri Dixit - and the stars of the painterly firmament too, like Tyeb Mehta and Bal Chhavda. ""This is my tribute to Indian cinema from the silence of Dadasaheb Phalke to the dazzle of Madhuri Dixit,"" says Husain.
And Madhuri returns the compliment: ""It is a learning experience for me."" She also released Husain's book, Art and Cinema, to mark the occasion. The paintings on display depict Husain's fascination with popular cinema. But what impresses the most are the artist's photographs, titled ""Culture of the Streets"", which has amazing billboards juxtaposed with city life.
The three-storey building, set among large boulders in Banjara Hills, is not just another museum of Husain's personal collections; it has a well-stocked library of books on art, cinema, music, dance, and computers. And its first exhibition features black and white photographs by director Bimal Roy. Husain will host a festival of ""specially made"" five-minute silent films every year with a cash prize of Rs 1 lakh for the best entry at the 40-seat theatre in the museum.
Real Life Battles
There were silent wars in the background. You could see the clenched teeth. Director of the Festival Malti Sahai and Andhra Pradesh State Film Development Corporation (APSFDC) Managing Director G. Kishan Rao have been locked in an unseemly Centre-state conflict even before the start of IFFI '99.
While the directorate of film festivals welcomed the red carpet and hospitality rolled out by the APSFDC it was reluctant to make available invitations and passes, forcing Rao to issue identity cards and passes on his own. But he kept it a low intensity conflict because an embarrassed Naidu cautioned him and other state officials from doing anything that could mar the reputation and prestige of the state."

Take this photograph, black and white, frayed and fading, and show it to him. Then tell him this story.When traffic policemen stopped his truck and demanded a bribe, he would hand the photograph to them. It showed a young man, smartly dressed, receiving the Arjuna Award from then President S. Radhakrishnan.
Even the policemen, stunned, could tell that the greasy, dishevelled trucker was once the young man in the blazer. ""Bewildered by my past, sometimes they would let me go.""
Introduce your son to the man in the photograph. Let him see failure close up. Makhan Singh, gold and silver medallist, Asian Games 1962. Makhan Singh, nobody, 1999. Forgotten by a nation in whose name he ran. But not forgotten alone.
Gopal Bhengra
Hockey World Cup, 1978
lungi and a banian. His wife is wrapped in a torn sari. His house is made of mud, straw and wood. Till three months ago he broke stone in a quarry.
Gopal Bhengra is an advertisement for not playing hockey for India.
The man, who played for his army unit with such distinction that Ashok Kumar remembers him immediately, needs to catch fish from a dirty pool nearby to get by. The man who played for India in the 1978 World Cup in Argentina can't afford to buy vegetables most days on his monthly pension of Rs 1,475.
He shows you his hands that were made to dribble, not crush 100 stones for Rs 50, and says it is his destiny. What else can a man say? When he retired in 1979 from the army he knocked at the doors of ministers, bureaucrats, businessmen. No one opened. He wrote to Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi asking for a peon's job. No one answered. Says he: ""For any sportsman nothing could be worse than being ignored and humiliated by his own people.""
Get in line.
PS: In Vyur Garia village, two young boys say they want to play hockey for India. Their father agrees. His name is Gopal Bhengra.
-Sanjay Kumar Jha
""For a sportsman nothing could be worse than being ignored by his own people.""
Unlock just one door of a thousand to India's sporting past and the stories tumble out. Jamshed, the caddie who rose to win the Arjuna Award, is back to being a Rs 30-an-hour caddie. Hockey Olympian S. Dungdung who says, ""Companies refuse to hire me as a security guard."" Some men have no names, some no fixed address, it is all so terrifyingly vague.
Ashok Kumar recalls meeting a fellow hockey Olympian in Chennai whose name he is unsure of, ""living like a beggar"". A footballer mentions he heard Mohammed Ali, who played for India in the Merdeka Cup in the '60s, was working as a coolie at Kampti railway station in Maharashtra. Is that true, is he alive, does anyone care?
It is asked on occasion, why doesn't India win many medals at Asian Games, Olympic Games?
Why?
In village Bhagta Bhai Ka in Punjab a young boy listens to a local politician promise a stadium in his grandfather's name. Not a brick has been laid. He hears his grandfather shout, ""Do I have to beg from them?"" telling visitors how the Punjab government refused him a pension as he had represented the Services.
He sees his grandfather, the triple Asian Games gold-medallist Parduman Singh, lying partially paralysed in his cot, and says, ""I'm proud to be his grandson but the medals don't inspire me to play sport.""
Sarwan Singh
Gold in hurdles, 1954
No. They want to speak to him about that other man he was. And he, 70, the retired ""Subedar"" to his neighbours, is stunned. A grin springs forth: ""No one has ever visited me to know how I am doing.""
It's the last time he smiles. A light from his past has blinked on and he wishes it never had. He remembers Jawaharlal Nehru's words, ""If you win it would be the nation's victory."" He remembers the tricolour rising when he won the 110 m hurdles gold at the 1954 Asian Games, ""feeling like a war hero"". Then he remembers the taxi he drove for 20 years.
Now, on request, he searches for his medals. Eventually he finds them, an entire heap. This is treasure, a nation's athletic history. ""No,"" says his son, ""this is junk.""
He must leave now, for he tills another man's land. It pays some bills. The Rs 1,500 monthly pension from the government pays others. ""That I exist in government records is a small consolation,"" he says wryly. Only on paper in a dusty file in a Delhi room does his heroism still breathe weakly.
-Ramesh Vinayak
""No one has ever visited me to find out how I am doing.""
Well done boy, go to school. Sport will get you nowhere. Play for India and they'll pump your hand and plead for autographs. Then they'll turn the page and discard you. When wrestler Madho Singh, fifth at the 1960 Rome Olympics, wanted a job as a school coach he was told, ""You're illiterate.""Nobody told them there was a price.
Noor Mohammed remembers ""putting my books under a stone and playing all day"". Yet the man who played football in Asian and Olympic Games now wonders about his tuberculosis and if his son, an electrician, has the money to pay for his medicines.
So how does one put this? The athlete is owed. You sleep, he runs; you loll in the shade, he trains in the sun and vomits. Yet you win together. He gets the medal, you get pride, pleasure, escape. Some mornings you feel better about being Indian. For that he is owed.
There is more. You can write books, play the piano, sell stocks, be a whiz of a marketing man till you're 50, till 60. The athlete at 30 plus is mostly dead. The best of him is gone. As he starts life again, he could do with a helping hand.
But it's not only the poverty that hurts. It is the indignity of worthy men who look into mirrors and see failure. It is the trauma of anonymity, that the men who once lauded them now throw their petitions in the dustbin. It is the flight of self-esteem.
Hockey Olympian Gopal Bhengra remembers being chief guest at the 1993 Albert Ekka hockey tournament. ""The VIP who inaugurated the tournament poured praises on me. But it stung because I know the same chap will kick me out from his office if I go to him for a small favour.""
Mohd Yousuf Khan
Gold in soccer, 1962
The boy hadn't noticed the words ""Arjuna Award"" on the nameplate.
The boy didn't know that in 1962 India beat South Korea to win its first ever Asian Games football gold medal.
The boy hadn't read that only two men from that team made it to the Asian All Star XI.
One of them was the man with the trembling hands, the player known as the ""The Bearded Horse"".
He does not have much else left. Dignity has flown and poverty lurks in the shadows. The Rome Olympian, of whom was once written in Sports and Pastime""he can be banked upon always to give his best in keeping the country's flag flying"", remembers days when he couldn't repair his shoes because he could not afford a cobbler. Now with a Rs 4,500 pension he manages to support his family.
Cricketers in Hyderabad have been allotted government land in upmarket areas like Banjara Hills. Mohammed Yousuf Khan the footballer, his slipper affixed together with a safety pin, unable to afford a cinema ticket, has been allotted humiliation. Says the old man with a saddening charm: ""I am ashamed to talk about how I meet my expenses.""
That day when the boy asked him whether he'd ever done physical exercise, Khan replied, ""Yes, I played football.""
Said the boy, ""You should have played cricket.""
-Amarnath K. Menon
""I am ashamed to talk about how I meet my expenses.""
These men know there were no guarantees, that no one said if you ran for India you'd be rich, famous, satisfied. But they deserved honour, appreciation. ""Honour!"" barks Madho Singh, ""playing for India didn't even give me a cup of tea."" The wives agree for they saw shame the closest.
Kusumtai, whose late husband K.D. Jadhav won a wrestling bronze at the 1952 Olympics, lifts his medals and says: ""What's the use of all this when he died unrecognised."" Take another story. Biswasi Toppo's late husband Noel was in the 1966 Asian Games hockey team; today, as she struggles on her nurse's salary of Rs 700 a month, she feels he would have been better off as a shoeshine boy.
But here it is, the insanity of it all. Despite everything, the romance endures. Under his bed, in a trunk, Noor Mohammed still has them, crumpled, shrunk, faded. His priceless blazers. Touching the crests that say India, Football, Asian Games, he says, ""They are like platinum for us.""
Far away in Punjab, Madho Singh mourns he has no son. Someone to wrestle for India he says. Insane yes, but it is this purity of passion that drives nations forward.
Corporations, cricket crazy, must put some away for India's athletes. Federations must organise benevolent funds. The government grants some financial assistance to troubled sportspersons and pensions to Asian, Olympic and World Championship medallists - but Rs 2,500 a month for Olympic gold medallists is too little.
""The state rejoices in the deeds of these men, so now it must bear the responsibility,"" says Sunil Gavaskar. It does not, so it is sportspeople who respond. In Punjab, Milkha Singh helps fellow athletes financially. Gavaskar has launched CHAMPS which will aid needy heroes and aspiring hopefuls.
In Mumbai, table tennis players Farrokh Khodaiji, Gautam Diwan and Niraj Bajaj set up a trust to assist fellow players. One incident demands retelling. A former champion, V. Shivraman, fell on hard times and received help over three years. He recovered, and says Khodaiji, ""wrote to say we should use the money for someone more deserving. Only a sportsman would have done this"".
These men know how hard it must be. For an athlete to arrive at a point when he walks into a pawn shop and tentatively hands over his medals. How much, the athlete asks. How much, he means, am I worth?
Some years ago Sarwan Singh took his 1954 Asian Games gold medal to the jeweller to sell. He was told it was worthless.
Him too?
If you dishonour your past, do not expect a future.
Makhan Singh
Gold in relay, 1962
Why didn't he finish college, find a job, raise his kids, watch television?
Which world was he living in that he believed a gold and a silver at an Asian Games (1962) would make him a hero forever?
Understand why this is being said. Look there at that dishevelled cripple with the artificial leg, at that stationery shop on the Chandigarh-Hoshiarpur highway, that's Makhan. Yes, once he ran like the wind. Once. Now he drinks up a storm.
Most nights he downs his bottle of rum, hoping the alcohol will mute his pain. Instead it stirs his melancholy. He weeps, he shouts: ""Keep this Arjuna Award away from my eyes."" This morning, he hops around the room placing small utensils on the floor to catch the rain that is seeping through his roof. He is not poor, this man; he is belittled.
Milkha beat him to gold at the 1962 Asian Games, but they won gold collectively in the relay. Then life went bad. He drove a truck, lost his leg, chased politicians for a gas agency outlet without success. When he pleaded with a Punjab MP for assistance two years ago, the man asked for Rs 5 lakh.
Now Makhan asks himself: who told you to run?

131,"As sperm quality and quantity fall, an epidemic confronts Indian men",[],2013-02-03 13:50:58,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201301/man_660_020313013108.jpg,"What does it mean to be a man? It can be different things at different times. And a tough call when you are trying to deposit your semen in a bottle in a private room at a fertility clinic. You have 15 minutes to do the job and there are a dozen others in queue awaiting their turn. Erotic imagery adorns sterile white walls. You have been administered 100 mg of Viagra. There is a mechanical vibrator, liquid paraffin and a laptop loaded with pornographic material to help you ejaculate. Once through, you wait for 30 nail-biting minutes as a microscope sizes up your fatherhood potential-the quality and quantity of your sperm. For Rs 600, you get to know if you are man enough to be a father.Every age has its own hazards. For the 21st century man, the quest for fatherhood brings untold anxiety. As health scares go, there is nothing like a hint of rising infertility in men. And the year 2013 has opened with a worry that the Indian sperm is not what it used to be. A French study that reported in December 2012 a 32 per cent drop in average sperm count globally has shaken the medical world. In India, the study has led to discussions and a body of scientific evidence adds fuel to a simmering suspicion that a great sperm slide is the hard reality hidden behind a culture of denial and silence.""Male infertility is on the rise,"" Union Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad stated in the Rajya Sabha in August last year. Doctors already know it as the country's best-kept health secret. That's why when couples visit them, they turn the first battery of tests on men today. A range of reports has come out in the wake of the first study in 2008 of 7,700 men with deteriorating semen quality from Kasturba Hospital in Manipal. Research at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi has shown a fall in average sperm count from 60 million per ml of semen to 20 million over three decades. A new study on semen parameters of 19,734 healthy men from the Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, reveals ""a genuine decline"" in sperm structure and movement.The 'mark of a man' has been many things but never a number under a microscope. Until recently, if a man did not have an obvious problem, he was considered good enough to father a child. That confidence has taken a beating. Young men now stream in and out of fertility labs, hopeful yet anxious, to find out the state of their manhood: Do they have at least 20 million sperms swimming actively in every ml of semen? Will at least 50 per cent have a healthy shape and structure? ""Please, check again"", they often urge. Even those who pass the test look shaken by the experience. It's not a comfortable place to be.The problem is not restricted to India's alone. The worldwide sperm count has seen a 50 per cent decline in 50 years, warns the influential British Medical Journal. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has revised its sperm count cut-off for normal men from 113 million/ ml in the 1950s to 20 million/ ml now. Researchers of the December French study, published in Oxford University's Human Reproduction, have sounded out a ""public health warning"" and highlighted the need for ""international monitoring"" of sperms. ""Male sperm quality is an issue globally,"" says Dr Siladitya Bhattacharya, professor of Reproductive Medicine at Aberdeen University, UK, whose onoging study shows sperm count has fallen 29 per cent over a decade in the UK.A new language is coming out of the woodwork. ""Swimmer"" is the new analogy for sperms. An average male releases 200-500 million sperms in a single ejaculation. In the frantic journey of the tadpole-like cells through viscous female fluids, many fall by the wayside, explains Dr Hrishikesh Pai, infertility specialist at Lilavati Hospital in Mumbai. Only a third of a man's sperms has normal structure, with a smooth oval head and a long undulating tail. They also need to swim at great speed, like guided missiles, to be of any use for fertilisation. Only 50-100 make it to the egg, of which about a dozen try to pierce the protective covering. One ultimately succeeds, if at all. Semen samples get routinely disqualified for being ""too thick"", ""too thin"", ""too few"", ""too slow"" or ""too sticky""-new words that haunt men.Men have new challenges thrown at their masculinity. Producing a semen sample on demand within a tiny window of time is one. 'Masturbatorium' is a new concept of a private room in high-end clinics with erotic aids to facilitate ejaculation, although in regular fertility labs, men have to use grimy toilets. Home sperm test kits, for men who aren't ready to seek professional help yet, are debuting in the market-the first launched in 2012. The device, much like home pregnancy test kits, has strips that indicate if one's sperm count makes the 20 million cut.Often, many suffer additional anxiety because they do not know the difference between infertility and impotence. ""Impotence is the persistent inability of a man to achieve satisfactory sexual activity, while infertility means poor quality or quantity of sperms,"" says gynaecologist Dr Priya Selvaraj of G.G. Hospital in Chennai. Both, however, impact intimate relationships, quality of life and self-esteem negatively. ""Although you know infertility is not necessarily linked to impotence, you still worry,"" says a Delhi man with low sperm count, asked to practise 'timed intercourse' in accordance with his wife's ovulation cycle. A 2012 study in the Journal of Andrology from Stanford University, US, shows pressure to perform can cause impotence in men by lowering the male sex hormone.That happened to a Kolkata man, now in his 40s. After years of trying for a baby, he was told he could not become a father. Doctors said he was suffering from a condition called azoospermia. It meant he ejaculated normally but had no sperms in the semen at all. Experts could not identify why he suffered from that. But the condition put a huge strain on his relationship with his wife. Every argument became acrid, with the wife taunting him for his 'incapacity' and going public about it. He never recovered from the blow to his male pride. The marriage continued, but he changed-from a pleasant, smiling man to a beaten, exhausted robot.Infertility has always been a woman's burden. ""I have had patients whose husbands tortured them, threw them out, got married again,"" says Dr Mamta Deenadayal of the Infertility Institute and Research Centre in Hyderabad. With a rise in male infertility, equations behind closed doors are changing. ""There was a time when a large number of divorces were filed on grounds of dowry and domestic violence,"" says advocate Kamini Jaiswal of Delhi. ""Now, it's impotence and infertility."" In a June 2012 case in the Karnataka High Court, when a wife sought divorce at not being able to conceive after two years of marriage and not enjoying ""married life to full satisfaction"", Justices N.K. Patil and B.V. Pinto observed, ""Questioning husband's impotency is an issue of life and death.""In a country where there is such a premium on manhood, the focus wouldn't have shifted to men but for a parallel trend: childlessness. Infertility in the general population is rising dramatically, especially in urban India. Based on Census figures, researchers at the International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, estimate a 50 per cent rise in childlessness between 1981 and 2001.""With 15-20 per cent Indian couples facing problems in conceiving, the focus has turned to men,"" says Dr Firuza Parikh, chief of assisted reproduction at Jaslok Hospital, Mumbai. ""In 40 per cent cases of involuntary childlessness in the country, the man's infertility is to blame,"" adds Dr Parikh. The main biological reasons behind male infertility are low sperm count or oligospermia, complete absence of sperms or azoospermia, poor sperm movement or asthenospermia, and abnormal sperm shape and structure or teratospermia. These could be due to swelling of the veins that drain the testicles, infections, anti-sperm antibodies, tumours, undescended testicles, hormone imbalance, sperm duct disorders, chromosome flaws and certain medication. ""There are new lifestyle factors at work,"" she says.Vivek Jayanth, 32, software engineer with a leading BPO company in Bangalore, had nothing wrong with his sperm count. But, under the microscope, a lot of his sperms seemed to be moving very slowly, with the tail coiled around the oval head. ""Are you a chef?"" asked the doctor. ""Your sperms look trapped by heat; typically that happens to men who work in hot surroundings."" Jayanth used to work with his laptop in his lap while watching TV with his wife, Prathima, 27, for a couple of hours every evening. Even an hour of doing so could raise sperm temperature by 2C, he was told.""The environment plays a major role,"" says Dr Suneeta Mittal, head of gynaecology at Fortis Hospital, Delhi. Over 2,000 new chemicals are introduced in the global market each year in everyday products. ""We do not know the effects of many of these chemicals on our health,"" she says. Alcohol lowers sperm production. Smoking changes the shape of sperms. Aspirin in high doses alters vital chemicals in the semen. Factors such as a diet rich in sugar, obesity, stress, sexually transmitted diseases, strenuous exercise, sleeplessness and ageing all play a part in infertility.With masculinity at stake, a new morality is coming into play. Many men are forced to resort to deception to maintain the 'purity of blood'. From an interview with the director of a sperm bank, who requested anonymity, sociologist Jyotsna Agnihotri Gupta reported in the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics in 2008 how in some cases of infertility in a man, his father or brothers would donate sperms, mostly while the wife was in the dark: ""They tell their wives, 'I'm bringing you my sample. There is some problem with you.' Then they bring someone else's semen.""At other times, there are crude commercial transactions in pursuit of a child. In January 2012, a couple sent shockwaves through the student community of IIT Chennai by placing an advertisement seeking sperms from an IITian with a high IQ for Rs 20,000.I t's not easy to treat male infertility. The tests are not foolproof and semen is one of the most difficult bodily fluids to collect and store. Limited knowledge allows aggressive marketing of poorly researched drugs. There is no registry of fertility clinics or sperm banks. Though the Indian Council of Medical Research has identified nearly 900 such clinics across the country, doctors believe there are more operating below the radar. There is no regulation to ensure they follow the latest (WHO) guidelines.The main problem in treating infertility is posed by masculinity itself. The shame of admission, male pride and unwillingness to be medicated shift the burden of treatment on the woman. A lack of ethics in an unregulated sector makes doctors complicit. As urologist Dr Rajeev Kumar of AIIMS says, ""There is a tendency to use the man simply as a sperm donor, while the healthy partner has to undergo painful and life-threatening interventions for in-vitro fertilisation.""Medical professionals claim to have known about the high levels of infertility in Indian men for years. One wonders what took so long for it to come out. The problem, after all, threatens India's future."

About three lakh teenagers can't kick the habit and one lakh need treatment. Every fifth college student in Delhi drinks regularly. About three lakh teenagers can't kick the habit and one lakh need treatment.
The parents were influential, the police turned silent and the incident got an official burial. But in Bangalore they still talk about it and with every telling the room turns cold with fear.
Five Bangalore boys decide to board a bus bound for Goa. One boy has stolen Rs 1.5 lakh from his parents to fund the trip. One of them gets cold feet and tips off the police. The errant four are found in Hubli, completely drunk. They are all 13 years old. They were going, they say, ""to drink and then die in Goa"".
Maybe that isn't chilling enough, so try this then. At 15, Sanjay Kumar was drinking Scotch. His father, a building contractor in Delhi wanted his son to ""live like a king"". This is a short story. At 19, the ""king"" was dead. Inebriated at a new year's party he drove his Zen into a pole.
The stories are getting gruesome, the evidence is mounting, the message is stark: teenage drinking is spiralling out of control. Drunk children in their shiny new cars with an alcohol-induced disdain for the law are worrying policemen.
Since January 1999, when the Chandigarh Police acquired a breath analyser, 226 people have been challaned for drunk driving. Nearly 40 per cent of them were teenagers. Similarly, the Maharashtra Police statistics show that in 1999 there were 244 accidents linked to teenagers who had imbibed a peg too many. Many of the accidents were fatal.
Teenagers, with no ID in hand, are streaming into liquor shops to buy their bottle of choice. Daljit Singh of Calcutta's Empire Stores says he gets an average of 60 teenage customers a day. ""They come during the daytime, and buy either canned beer or white drinks like vodka which are easy to conceal.""
Youngsters arriving at school with the stale smell of beer on their breath are not completely unknown. In Calcutta the principal of one of the city's posh schools suspended a boy for drinking on the campus.
In Delhi, Rajesh Kumar, then 15, drove to school with his friends, all clearly inebriated, and was thrown out. Today, with a history of deviant behaviour like locking his parents out of the house because they refused to give him a Gypsy, he is an alcoholic undergoing counselling. He is only 17.
Psychiatrists across the country are alarmed by this sudden spurt in teenage alcoholism. Delhi psychologist Dr Achal Bhagat puts it starkly, ""Alcoholism is becoming a lifestyle for teenagers"". In Chennai, Dr Gopalakrishnan at Chennai's Apollo Hospitals says, ""Children are misinterpreting a mug of beer for a fashion fad.""
He has six to 10 troubled teenage drinkers visiting him every month. Society in its ambivalence may pass it off as youthful indiscretion but it is far more serious than that. Alcohol routinely destroys brain cells, binge drinking can kill - in Bangalore, 17 youngsters drank all night late last year to find one of their friends dead in his own vomit the next morning - and the liver begins to malfunction.
Research by the WHO says that one out of 25 drinkers turns into an alcoholic. That's a scary statistic considering that alcoholics are 50 to 100 times more prone to commit suicide. As R. Kumar, a counsellor at the Bangalore chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous, confirms, ""We have more and more young people coming to us with drinking problems.""
Beyond the health impact is a larger social problem: young drinkers who move from use to abuse find their grades dropping, their interpersonal relationships turning sour and they often resort to deviant behaviour.
Says Harsh Vardhan, former health minister of Delhi and currently adviser to WHO's regional director for South-East Asia: ""When teenagers drink they damage their physical and mental growth. They are in fact chasing death.""
Almost half the 3,000 schoolchildren surveyed in Mumbai felt that alcohol was not harmful and that it enhanced self-confidence. Almost half the 3,000 schoolchildren surveyed in Mumbai felt that alcohol was not harmful and that it enhanced self-confidence.
The malaise is rooted in the societal acceptance of alcohol and society's indulgent view towards teenagers knocking down the odd peg. Unlike drugs that have an alarming connotation to them, a frothy glass of beer is hardly taboo.
If anything, there is a conspicuous absence of deterring messages. The images that waft into living rooms through cable television seem to promote the idea that a swig of beer equals youthful exuberance. Instead of public caution over alcohol's harmful effects, the signals are positive.
It's hard to convict Shah Rukh Khan for sauntering through a Bagpiper advertisement or Ajay Jadeja for dancing for Kingfisher, but there's no one there to interpret the message for children who go wide-eyed at what their heroes are doing. As psychiatrist Dr Debashish Bhattacharya explains, ""Teenagers have several mistaken notions about drinking: that it is masculine, it enhances the sex drive and that achievers do it.""
Hanging around at home with 17-year-old friends and posturing over a whisky bottle, or popping into a bar for an illegal pitcher of beer because it's hep, is common conduct among teenagers. For a generation of sensation seekers with an extremely low threshold of boredom, this is terrific pastime.
As Shruti, an 18-year-old pub-goer from Chandigarh, says, ""Beer is not an intoxicant. It's a social lubricant."" Alcohol becomes an excuse for everything. If you're too shy to talk to a girl, rum will give you courage; if you're not fitting in with your peers what's a vodka if it means acceptance.
Peer pressure as always can be tortuous and as Deepa, a fresher at a Mumbai college puts it, ""If you say no you could be alone for the entire evening and labelled a spoilsport. So what's the big deal in a couple of beers?"" Dilip, a third-year student explains soothingly, ""The next morning the maximum you have is a headache.""
If only it was that simple. Sanjay Sahney knows, for he too began with a glass of beer just to be part of the crowd. An engineering student in Mumbai, the metropolis was a different world for this insular Indore boy.
No parents to note his movements, a rich girlfriend who enjoyed frequenting the city's hot spots, life was that cliched ""big party"", he says. Except that one glass of beer grew to a bottle, one bottle grew to four a day. ""I used to crave for the high because it left me happy.""
Except that his grades slipped and he fell into debt, till a student counsellor sent him to Seva Dan, an NGO that works with alcohol and drug abusers. Today, eight months later, Sahney is limping back to normalcy.
In the heat of the moment, young men are too busy to realise that the confidence a bellyful of beer brings is entirely false and often dangerous. They strut out of bars ready to do Michael Schumacher impersonations on city roads only to wind up sober in the morgue.
Similarly, a brain addled by too many whiskies emboldens shy young men and leads them into risky sexual behaviour. ""They consume alcohol to get the confidence ... and then they visit prostitutes,"" says Sekhar Sheshadri, additional professor of psychiatry, NIMHANS. A scary corollary to this is another NIMHANS study which reveals that 70 per cent of HIV patients are alcoholics, especially teenagers.
The best way to control the problem is to make it more difficult for youngsters to find a drink. Liquor shops must insist on proof of age. The best way to control the problem is to make it more difficult for youngsters to find a drink. Liquor shops must insist on proof of age.
As alcohol abuse grows it becomes a significant crutch and much like Asterix, young people believe that one sip of this magic potion is all it takes. A survey of 3,000 class 10 students by Seva Dan in 13 schools in Mumbai revealed some frightening figures.
Forty-eight per cent of the children didn't think that alcohol was harmful, 47 per cent said it helped gain confidence and 52 per cent said it helped decrease mental tension.
If parents are slow to recognise their child is stressed, they take a mild view if their children toss back a few even if they haven't reached the legal age. As Panjab University sociologist Rajesh Gill says, ""It's no longer stigmatised."" The comments are not out of place.
A fortnight ago, Sanjeev Verma, owner of Wild West, one of Chandigarh's oldest pubs, was told by a father that he wanted beer served at his son's school passing-out party. A manager of a bowling company in Mumbai concurs: ""We have the right to refuse but if a parent asks for a pitcher of beer and pours his teenage son a glassful we are helpless.""
Not all parents grant their children a drinking license. Yet when both parents work and attempt to compensate for their absence by doling out large sums of pocket money, it can be a dangerous indulgence.
It is a situation that is compounded by the easy availability of alcohol, says Vimla Nadkarni, professor at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai. Unlike most western countries where only the flash of a required ID is a passport to a drink, laws in India are loosely enforced.
Eighteen may be the legal age to ask for a beer but one round of the pubs in any city confirms that few bartenders have ever heard of it. And there are certainly no shortage of pubs. Six years ago, Chandigarh, a city of white beards, had just two pubs; today there are 26.
Excise Department rules also stipulate that a liquor outlet must not come up within 100 m of an educational institution or religious place, but it is a rule easily flouted. Governments see no sin in being casual, blinded as they may be by profits.
In Maharashtra, the excise income from sales of beer, IMFL, and wine in 1997-98 was Rs 774.79 crore; in 1998-99 it is expected to be Rs 1,023.23 crore.
Naturally, teenage alcoholism is also on the rise. According to studies done by the De-Addiction Centre at AIIMS in Delhi, every fifth teenager in the 15-19 age group in the capital drinks regularly and around three lakh are addicted.
Another one lakh, it is estimated, need medical attention for alcohol-related disorders. Says H.K. Sharma, a social scientist who was associated with the studies: ""Any party or get-together is incomplete without corks popping open. It's a whirlpool into which children get sucked so easily.""
To alter established mind-sets, to convince a generation that the buzz that comes with a beer has dangerous implications, requires a mammoth effort.
Counsellors stress that parents must start communicating with their children, identify reasons for their stress and not turn away with a grin when junior steals a peg of whisky from daddy's cabinet. In fact, some Mumbai colleges have already put up posters that read, ""Drinking with Dad is also Bad"".
The most basic of all prevention is enforcing the ban on sale to those under 18. The harder it is for kids to find a drink the better it is. As Y.G. Rajalakshmi Parthasarathy, dean of the Chennai's Padma Seshadri group of schools insists: ""Age certificates have to be made a must.""
Chennai Police say they conduct surprise raids in front of schools on Saturday nights when teenagers are prone to drink and drive, but it's not enough.
Also, a society that merely smirks at underage kids trying to find some machismo in a beer mug needs to understand there's nothing amusing in it. The journey from recreation to addiction, or to death in a Zen at 19, is not a long one.

133,Evidence indicates US shooter Adam Lanza's deadlier plan in school massacre,[],2012-12-20 00:00:00,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201212/us-3_660_121612125727_0_0.jpg,"The gunman in the Connecticut shooting rampage shot his mother four times in the head before going to the school and gunning down 26, authorities said on Sunday as details emerged suggesting that Adam Lanza had planned an even more gruesome massacre but was stopped short.
Lanza blasted his way into the building and used a high-power rifle to kill 20 children and six adults, including the principal who tried to stop him, authorities said.
The unthinkable bloodshed might even have been worse. Gov. Dannel Malloy said Lanza shot himself as first responders entered the building and a law enforcement official said Lanza had ""lots of ammo"" on him when he died, enough to carry out significant additional carnage. The official he was not authorized to release details of the case and spoke on condition of anonymity.
""We surmise that it was during the second classroom episode that he heard responders coming and apparently at that, decided to take his own life,"" Malloy said on ABC's ""This Week.""
As President Barack Obama prepared a visit and churches opened their doors to comfort a grieving town Sunday, federal agents fanned out to dozens of gun stores and shooting ranges across Connecticut, chasing leads they hoped would cast light on Lanza's life.
Shop owners Tamara Doherty, left, and Jackie Gaudet, right, meet outside their stores for the first time since being neighbours, just down the road from Sandy Hook Elementary School on Saturday. Shop owners Tamara Doherty, left, and Jackie Gaudet, right, meet outside their stores for the first time since being neighbours, just down the road from Sandy Hook Elementary School on Saturday.
Among the questions: Why did his mother, a well-to-do suburban divorcee, keep a cache of high-power weapons in the house? What experience did Lanza have with those guns? And, above all, what set him on a path to go classroom-by-classroom, massacring 6- and 7-year-olds?
Malloy offered no possible motive for the shooting and a law enforcement official has said police have found no letters or diaries left behind that could shed light on it.
Lanza shot his mother, Nancy Lanza, to death at the home they shared Friday. She was shot four times in the head and found in her bed wearing pajamas, said a state official who was not authorized to disclose details of the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity.
Lanza then drove to Sandy Hook Elementary School in her car with at least three of his mother's guns, forced his way in by breaking a window and opened fire, authorities said. Within minutes, he killed the children, six adults and himself.
All the victims at the school were shot with a rifle, at least some of them up close, and all were apparently shot more than once, Chief Medical Examiner Dr. H. Wayne Carver said. There were as many as 11 shots on the bodies he examined. Lanza died of a gunshot wound to the head from a 10 mm gun, and the bullet was recovered in a classroom wall, said the same official who described the scene at his mother's house.
All six adults killed at the school were women. Of the 20 children, eight were boys and 12 were girls.
Asked whether the children suffered, Carver said, ""If so, not for very long."" Asked how many bullets were fired, Carver said, ""I'm lucky if I can tell you how many I found.""
Authorities have identified Adam Lanza as the gunman who killed his mother at their home and then opened fire on Friday. Authorities have identified Adam Lanza as the gunman who killed his mother at their home and then opened fire on Friday.
Parents identified the children through photos to spare them some shock, Carver said.
The terrible details about the last moments of young innocents emerged as authorities released their names and ages - the youngest 6 and 7, the oldest 56. They included Ana Marquez-Greene, a little girl who had just moved to Newtown from Canada; Victoria Soto, a 27-year-old teacher who apparently died while trying to hide her pupils; and principal Dawn Hochsprung, who authorities said lunged at the gunman in an attempt to overtake him.
The tragedy has plunged Newtown into mourning and added the picturesque New England community of 27,000 people to the grim map of towns where mass shootings in recent years have periodically reignited the national debate over gun control but led to little change.
School officials were trying to determine what to do about sending the survivors back to class, Newtown police Lt. George Sinko said at a news conference Sunday.
Sinko said he ""would find it very difficult"" for students to return to the school. But, he added, ""we want to keep these kids together. They need to support each other,"" he said.
Plans were being made for some students to attend classes in nearby Monroe, said Jim Agostine, superintendent of schools there.
Residents and faith leaders reflected Sunday on the mass shooting and what meaning, if any, to find in it. Obama planned to attend an interfaith vigil - the fourth time he will have traveled to a city after a mass shooting.
At Saint Rose of Lima Roman Catholic church, Jennifer Waters, who at 6 is the same age as many of the victims and attends a different school, came to Mass on Sunday in Newtown with a lot of questions.
""The little children - are they with the angels?"" she asked her mother while fiddling with a small plastic figurine on a pew near the back of the church. ""Are they going to live with the angels?""
Her mother, Joan, 45, assured her they were, then put a finger to her daughter's lips, urging her to be quiet.
An overflow crowd of more than 800 people attended the 9 a.m. service at the church, where eight children will be buried later this week. The gunman, Adam Lanza, and his mother also attended church here. Spokesman Brian Wallace said the diocese has yet to be asked to provide funerals for either.
Adam Lanza, third from the right, poses for a group photo of the technology club which appeared in the Newtown High School yearbook. Adam Lanza, third from the right, poses for a group photo of the technology club which appeared in the Newtown High School yearbook.
Boxes of tissues were placed strategically in each pew and on each window sill. The altar was adorned with bouquets, one shaped as a broken heart, with a zigzag of red carnations cutting through the white ones.
In his homily, the Rev. Jerald Doyle, the diocesan administrator, tried to answer the question of how parishioners could find joy in the holiday season with so much sorrow surrounding them.
""You won't remember what I say, and it will become unimportant,"" he said. ""But you will really hear deep down that word that will finally and ultimately bring peace and joy. That is the word by which we live. That is the word by which we hope. That is the word by which we love.""
After the Mass, Joan and Jennifer stopped by a makeshift memorial outside the church, which was filled with votive candles and had a pile of bouquets and stuffed animals underneath, to pray the Lord's Prayer.
Jennifer asked whether she could take one.
""No, those are for the little children,"" her mother replied.
""Who died?"" her daughter asked.
""Yes,"" said her mother, wiping away a tear.
Amid the confusion and sorrow, stories of heroism emerged, including an account of Hochsprung, 47, and the school psychologist, Mary Sherlach, 56, rushing toward Lanza in an attempt to stop him. Both died.
There was also 27-year-old teacher Victoria Soto, whose name has been invoked as a portrait of selflessness. Investigators told relatives she was killed while shielding her first-graders from danger. She reportedly hid some students in a bathroom or closet, ensuring they were safe, a cousin, Jim Wiltsie, told ABC News.
""She put those children first. That's all she ever talked about,"" a friend, Andrea Crowell, told The Associated Press. ""She wanted to do her best for them, to teach them something new every day.""
There was also 6-year-old Emilie Parker, whose grieving father, Robbie, talked to reporters not long after police released the names of the victims but expressed no animosity, offering sympathy for Lanza's family.
""I can't imagine how hard this experience must be for you,"" he said.
The gunman's father, Peter Lanza, issued a statement relating his own family's anguish in the aftermath.
""Our family is grieving along with all those who have been affected by this enormous tragedy. No words can truly express how heartbroken we are,"" he said. ""We are in a state of disbelief and trying to find whatever answers we can. We too are asking why. ... Like so many of you, we are saddened, but struggling to make sense of what has transpired.""
The rifle used was a Bushmaster .223-caliber, according to an official with knowledge of the investigation who was not authorized to speak about it and talked on condition of anonymity. The gun is commonly seen at competitions and was the type used in the 2002 sniper killings in the Washington, D.C., area. Also found in the school were two handguns, a Glock 10 mm and a Sig Sauer 9 mm.
A law enforcement official said Saturday that authorities were investigating fresh leads that could reveal more about the lead-up to the shooting. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.
Ginger Colbrun, spokeswoman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said earlier there was no evidence Lanza was involved in gun clubs or had trained for the shooting. When reached later in the day and asked whether that was still true, she said, ""We're following any and all leads related to this individual and firearms.""
Victims' family and friends attend a candlelight vigil held behind Stratford High School on the Town Hall Green in Stratford. Victims' family and friends attend a candlelight vigil held behind Stratford High School on the Town Hall Green in Stratford. Law enforcement officials have said they have found no note or manifesto from Lanza of the sort they have come to expect after murderous rampages such as the Virginia Tech bloodbath in 2007 that left 33 people dead.
Education officials said they had found no link between Lanza's mother and the school, contrary to news reports that said she was a teacher there. Investigators said they believe Adam Lanza attended Sandy Hook many years ago, but they had no explanation for why he went there Friday.
Authorities said Adam Lanza had no criminal history, and it was not clear whether he had a job. Lanza was believed to have suffered from a personality disorder, said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Another law enforcement official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said Lanza also had been diagnosed with Asperger's, a mild form of autism often characterized by social awkwardness.
People with the disorder are often highly intelligent. While they can become frustrated more easily, there is no evidence of a link between Asperger's and violent behavior, experts say.
The law enforcement officials insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the unfolding investigation.
Richard Novia, the school district's head of security until 2008, who also served as adviser for the high school technology club, of which Lanza was a member, said he clearly ""had some disabilities.""
""If that boy would've burned himself, he would not have known it or felt it physically,"" Novia said in a phone interview. ""It was my job to pay close attention to that."""
134,Travels in liquor zone,[],2012-12-20 00:00:00,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201212/palash-krishna-mehrotra-20_660_120212104338.jpg,"Notwithstanding liberalisation and its many effects little has changed on the ground for the average Indian tippler.
MRP of whisky is popularly referred to as the 'Mayawati tax' in UP
It was only after Ponty Chadha was killed that I figured why for years we'd been paying a mark up on the listed MRP of whisky- popularly referred to as the 'Mayawati tax'- in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. In the case of bestselling brands like McDowells Platinum, the mark up was 40 rupees a bottle.
I remember having arguments with vend owners, with fellow tipplers irately pitching in, but to no avail.
They'd be tight lipped, or say that prices had gone up, or just be plain brazen: If you don't want it at my price, then go find another theka.
That, one soon realised, was a waste of time, because everyone in town was selling at higher than the listed price.
Drinking
Ponty Chadha had an efficient private police, an extra legal excise army. This private police had its own hierarchy and its job was to prevent smuggling of liquor from other states, to make sure that truckloads of liquor from, say, Punjab didn't flood Ponty's territory.
While the man on the street had to shell out way above the legitimate price, Ponty launched his own brand, Raffles. Raffles rum did reasonably well, and managed to take some market share away from the old classics like Celebration, Old Monk and Sikkim. Because he had a monopoly over liquor vends, Ponty made sure that Raffles rum was easily available, often at the cost of other brands.
We Indians drink quite a bit. Even though the Indian consumer is extremely price sensitive, this is one of the most lucrative markets in the world in terms of turnover.
Which is why everyone, from the government and politicians, to hustlers and wheeler- dealers, wants a share of the pie. Of course, on paper our attitude to drinking is the same as it is to sex. We pretend we don't do it. Advertising for liquor brands is banned.
This was one of the reasons Vijay Mallaya named his airline Kingfisher. It was one way to advertise his beer. Surrogate advertising is the usual route taken by liquor companies, often with comic consequences.
I remember a commercial for 8PM (originally a whisky brand) apple juice. The man has a sip and crazy things happen to him. The tag line goes-' 8 PM apple juice.
Kuch bhi ho sakta hai' (Anything can happen).
Possibly the most potent apple juice ever concocted.
Fermented maybe? While the liquor industry has expanded, and new foreign brands enter the market every month, little has changed on the ground for the Indian tippler. Thekas remain poky holes where one passes money through a grilled window to buy a bottle. In the evenings there is a crush to buy alcohol, which means that women are seldom seen at liquor stores. As a woman, your best bet lies in asking an office mate or a male family member to buy your quota. Where to drink is also a problem because Indian families are not comfortable with alcohol being consumed at home.
It remains a cultural taboo.
Taboo
If you are in a UP town like Allahabad, options are limited. Most people drink standing right behind the beer shop. They blend into the darkness of the night, and sip their beer surrounded by the stench of sewage. This is also the reason why in India quarts are bestsellers, outselling bottles by a huge margin.
It's less to do with money and more to do with the fact that one can't take a 750 ml bottle home. In Allahabad, people hire cycle rickshaws for half an hour. The quart is then consumed in the moving cycle rickshaw. I have a school friend there who loves to drink but cannot keep a bottle at home. He's married and lives in a joint family. On Sundays, he buys a quart and drives around town with his wife and kid, sipping on his whisky. His mother would rather that he drink outside the house, putting the lives of his family, not to mention his own, at risk.
Such is the power of taboo.
I was in Allahabad a year ago and met up with this friend after some years. I suggested we meet for a drink. He explained his situation.
So I said why not meet at this new bar that had opened down the road from us. I wasn't at all comfortable with him drinking while he had his hands on the wheel and his eyes on the road. He turned the idea down on the grounds that he was a family man now and it wouldn't be appropriate for him to be seen at a watering hole. It seems even going out isn't an option.
This option does exist in big cities where there's anonymity and chances of being seen are less. But then it gets very expensive.
As Dave Besseling writes in his new book The Liquid Refuses to Ignite , Delhi's pub scene makes it very clear that you are either very rich, or very poor: ""If you're in the middle, f*** off and drink at home."" But, you see, we cannot drink at home.
Still, human beings will always find ways of doing what they like. Since it's the festive season, let me take you on a little guided tour of cheap IMFL brands. Now, most upper middle class types wouldn't touch these brands with a barge pole but not being upper middle class myself, these are the only brands I know intimately.
Please allow me, dear reader, to share my sundry knowledge with you.
This is the world of cheap whisky that exists between the price range of 220 rupees and 500 rupees. It begins with Aristocrat and Bagpiper and Diplomat and ends with Peter Scot. In socialist India, the high life was associated with a top- notch government job, hence Diplomat. We also had the aspirational Director's Special, aspirational because in socialist India there was hardly any private sector and so very few directors of companies.
Brands
The trick with these whiskies is to drink them as though they were lighttextured rum. They are made of molasses and have no grain. Then comes McDowells No 1 and its premium version Platinum.
The former is a cult success, the whisky that is adulterated the most.
Which is why it comes in a golden tamper- proof carry bag. Pay 50 rupees more and you can buy its Platinum avatar which comes with some inspired copywriting on the packaging that gushes about peat, oakwood, vanilla and something called ' complex spring flowers'. There's Officers Choice, which claims to be the drink of honest upright officers, and Radico's 8PM, which was the first to break from aspirational names like Diplomat, appealing instead to the time in the evening when middle class India sits down to have a drink. And finally, there's Peter Scot, which used to be the favourite drink of successful high court lawyers but has now slid down the snob chart. I'm not even going near Blenders Pride and the world that lies beyond. To me it's like China- a country that I've heard a lot about but never visited. I hope to do so one day."
135,Drink dependence up in urban Indian women,[],2011-12-20 00:00:00,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201211/drinking-660_113012040230.jpg,"The 33-year-old married woman from Chandigarh had never imagined that her excessive clubbing and partying would one day push her to the brink of suicide. But it did.
She was not the only one. In an increasing trend of urban women taking to alcohol to cope with everyday stresses as societal norms ease, a 28-year-old woman working as a senior executive in a property broking firm in Mumbai also developed suicidal tendencies.
What started for both the Bacchus lovers as socialising, ended up in drink dependence and pushed them into the infamous club of over 14 million alcohol consumers in the country who require help. Though there are no exact figures of how many of these are women, the trend is clear.
The Mumbai woman ran up a debt of Rs25 lakh (Rs2.5 million) and attempted suicide due to her ""unmanageable"" life and depression. The Chandigarh woman showed addiction- related suicidal tendencies after a turbulent married life, extra-marital affairs and a failed patch-up bid with her husband.
The two are now trying to get a grip over their lives and move away from drink dependence, with some help from de-addiction experts who say they needed to be cared like brain patients who don't know how to prevent themselves from returning to the old habit despite being aware of its perils.
But their difficult phase is over, says NGO Tulasi Home's consultant doctor Goruv Gupta. ""Realising or accepting that one needs help is the toughest part of getting over the drink dependence problem.""
Sociologist Sachin Kumar, associated with Alcoholics Anonymous, told IANS: ""Intoxication by women in some communities has existed for time immemorial. Traditionally, it has been a collective activity but in modern times the incidence of individual drinking has shown a rise.""
The social checks or restraint that used to prescribe the limit of alcohol consumption in older times have faded over the years, leading to worst forms of drink dependence among both men and women, he said.
According to a 2009 article in journal The Lancet, Indians, officially, are still among the world's lowest consumers of alcohol - government statistics show only 21 percent of adult men and around two percent of women drink. But up to a fifth of this group - about 14 million people - are dependent drinkers requiring ""help"".
""Addiction is a chronic, relapsing disease, characterised by compulsive alcohol seeking and use, and by neurochemical and molecular changes in the brain,"" said Gupta.
For women drinkers, the news is worse than for men.
Gupta warned that alcohol addiction was more harmful for a woman's body as compared to a man; in a woman, alchohol tends to induce permanent hormonal changes in the body, making rehabilitation more difficult.
The problem of shortage of de-addiction centres was also more acute for women.
Ruchika Kumari, who works at several private de-addiction centres in Delhi, agreed: ""Alcohol addiction is considered to carry a bigger social stigma for women as compared to men and the challenge of weaning away is tougher for them due to shortage of fully-equipped centres.""
""Families need to leave the women dependent drinkers at deaddiction centre's for medical aid and counselling and this needs a lot of faith in the facility,"" she said.
""Most people prefer private facilities as they score over the government sector in terms of security, hygiene and quality of treatment.""
She revealed that there was no particular age bracket for women drinkers. ""At our centre in south Delhi, we have women from 48 years to 28 years seeking counselling.""
The service that private centres offer to get rid of dependence comes at a price.
A six-week rehabilitation procedure in some of the high-end centres in Delhi costs around Rs1 lakh (Rs100,000). In Delhi alone there are over three dozen NGO-run, private and government facilities that offer help to people with drink dependence.
Gupta warned against ill-trained quacks offering help to dependent drinkers and ending up traumatising the patient.
""I have seen a case where a patient was sent by his family to a private facility in Haryana and there he was tortured, stripped and humiliated in the name of de-addiction,"" he said."

In March, Satara, a small town in Maharashtra, was rocked by a sex scandal that threatens to plunge the conservative pensioners' paradise into an image crisis. The disgrace came to light on March 22, leading to the arrest of 24 people on charges of blackmail and sexual exploitation.
The main accused - Prithviraj Chavan, 46, Sanjay Pawar, 33, and Mrudula Vanarase, 20 - had a simple modus operandi to lure young women. After promising them roles in films, the girls, aged between 18 and 25 years, were induced to pose in revealing clothes, often under the influence of alcohol.
The photographs were then used to blackmail them into offering favours to men who claimed to be film financiers. These included jaunts not just in seedy Satara lodges but also in the neighbouring Panchgani and Mahabaleshwar areas.
Besides being threatened with disclosure to their families and the media, the girls were stalked and even beaten up when they refused to comply. According to the police, no monetary transactions took place as the abusers were aware of the girls' exploitation.
However, rumours abound that many of the arrested people, including contractor sand shop owners, reportedly thought the victims were commercial sex workers and paid them for their services.
In fact, several business men have left town fearing that they will be targeted even as the police deny that a ""witch hunt"" is on.
Gaikwad, Vanarase and Chavan Gaikwad, Vanarase and Chavan
The police claim undisputed proof of blackmail and abuse since March 2000 and suspect the racket might have begun as early as August 1999 and are now scanning the cellular phone records of both Chavan and Pawar. A video tape has also been reportedly retrieved from Chavan's house though the police deny the claim.
Chavan, an electronics repair shop owner-turned-film director, claims to have been in the film business since 1989 and even floated the Srinath Cine Film Society.
Though he does not have a single film release to his credit, in order to bolster his image as a big-league director Chavan keeps two photo albums of an under-production Marathi film, Heerva Shalu, starring well-known Marathi actors Reshma Tipnis and Ashok Shinde.
Assisting Chavan was Pawar, a former owner of a cosmetics shop, and Va-narase, a first-year college student who is also Chavan's cousin. Vanarase is believed to have convinced young girls that the duo would give the mabreakin films.
Others who helped rope in girls included Mangal Gaikwad, a midwife at the Satara Civil Hospital, and Tarkeshwari Wankhede, who ran Plus Green Investments that acted as a front.
The police chanced upon the racket while investigating afraud, where in alocal person was cheated of Rs 11,000 after being promised a bank job by Chavan.
Sanjay Pawar Sanjay Pawar
On March 20, a local paper carried a new item alleging that Pawar and Chavan were involvedin defrauding people. During investigation, the police received a complaint from a girl who claimed to have been black mailed and sexually abused by the duo.Three more complaints were lodged within a week and till date the police have registered seven complaints. Though the police are tight lipped about the women's identity, it is believed that the victims included a dance teacher who has acted in local theatre productions, another who is training to be a nurse and one who was lured with the promise of a bank job.
The girls also alleged that the duo took money from them on the plea that they were running short of funds for the film. ""They were asked to give exorbitant amounts but the girls could not afford it. Even so, some of them shel led out as much as Rs 50,000,"" says Superintendent of Police R. Pawar.
The girls were photo graphed under the pretext of shooting for a film. According to Dhirendra Raj Purohit, who owns a 14-room lodge in the town, Chavan would book rooms for his crew. ""They would be accompanied by crew members, including camera men and actors who were not residents of Satara,"" adds Purohit. The other haunt, Hotel Godhan, whose owner has been arrested and the unlicensed lodge sealed, is a short distance away from the main city.

Meanwhile, speculation is rife over the role of the girls who, local people believe, were willing accomplices and blew the whistle only when they realised they were being duped by the duo.
""It is hard to believe that these girls were under pressure for more than a year and were none the wiser for it,"" says a social worker requesting anonymity. The speculation not with standing, Nirmala Sawant Prabhwarkar of the Maharashtra State Women's Commission has sent a report to the chief minister, requesting that a special court oversee and wind up the case within two years.
The investigation has been further complicated by the death of Sambhaji Jadhav, cashier of the Srinath Nagarik Sahakari Cooperative Bank on March 31.
Jadhav went missing for two days before his body was found froma canalout-side Satara. Jadhav's death may be significant because bank Director Dutta Uttekar and Chavan have been found to e a joint account which was used to fund the latter's films.
Uttekar was also an office-bearer of Chavan's cine society. Though one of the prime suspects, he was brought in for questioning only towards the end of the week because of alleged political pressure. After collapsing during questioning, Uttekar is recuperating at Satara's Sahayadri Hospital.
If the past week is anything to go by, the scandal is still unfolding. The police deny political pressure, but even if there is, the local people are determined to see the guilty nailed. In a town that is yet to discover pubs and where raised hem lines still raise a brow, the shameful event will be fodder for gossip for a long time."
137,She's got a ticket to write,[],2012-10-29 12:52:51,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"By Anita Nair
Penguin
In the flood of ""Wimmen's writing"" that depicts women as battered, bartered and abandoned on the shoals of low self worth, Anita Nair's second novel rides triumphantly against the tide. Second novel? Is it possible? The ink has barely dried on Nair's first one, The Better Man, that trawled with intent through fiction's latest heart of darkness, the matrilineal murkdom of Kerala, when she's produced another one.
The better woman: A store of revelatory life-affirming tales The better woman: A store of revelatory life-affirming tales
Apparently, Nair's imagination teems with stories that leap out like tiny silver fish, struggling to escape a fisherman's basket. As though to acknowledge the fact, she has signalled that her book is ""a novel in parts"" and indeed she seems more adept at stringing together a collection of short stories than in going for the long haul.
In Ladies Coupe Nair has resorted to one of the oldest ploys. She has taken a leaf out of Chaucer's mixed crowd of pilgrims travelling to Canterbury telling tales to each other. He himself, as is well known, borrowed from Boccacio who had his well-heeled cast of characters relating stories to each other while sitting out the plague. Nair's characters too are singularly life affirming.
Though they do not confess their life stories publicly to each other while sitting in what used to be a regular feature of rail journeys, the ""ladies compartment"" or coupe of the title, the manner in which she has them sharing their experiences with the protagonist, Akhila or Akhilandeswari, as she becomes towards the end, assuming her full potential as a woman, quite often sounds like a female version of Alcoholics Anonymous.
Excerpt Akhila dreams: a train that trundles, truckles and troops into a station. Akhila is seated by a window. Everything but the train is still. The moon hangs at her shoulder and rides with her. She travels through a gallery of nightscapes, each framed by the window. A light in a house. A family huddled around a fire. A howling dog. A distant town. Black oily waters of a river. A menacing hill. A curling road. A railway-crossing with the streetlight glinting on the glasses of a man on a static scooter, hands dangling at his side, heel on the ground, head cocked, watching, waiting for the train to hurtle past. At the station, portraits replace impressions. Reunions. Farewells. A smile. Tears. Anger. Irritation. Anxiety. Boredom. Stillness. Akhila sees them all. The train begins to move.
Akhila dreams of being there. And not there. Of adding a memory by the moment.
Were the railways providing a hitherto unknown service to the sisterhood of women by throwing them in together for a night and a day of bonding through the boondocks of the Indian countryside? We shall never know. Part of the charm of Nair's narrative is that we are lulled into accepting her thesis.
Once locked in together, it's a question of age no bar, caste no bar, sex no bar, indeed the intimacy with which the ladies discuss their sexual adventures seems to underline the message that ""having sex"" is destiny.
Akhila herself is the magnet for their stories. She has suddenly decided to take her life in her hands. At the age of 45, having achieved near anonymity working as a clerk in the Income Tax Department she is suddenly filled with the idea of revolt. She decides to bolt, to take a long train journey to Kanyakumari.
Are there shades of an Anita Brookner heroine here, encased in stiffly starched cotton saris and the disappointments of a lifetime of sacrifice travelling to her own Hotel Sea Breeze by the seafront? Though she might lack the subtlety of a Brookner heroine, Akhila is not without her desires.
There's a hilarious description of her singular form of revolt when she wants to taste a boiled egg brought by an Anglo-Indian colleague to work and, much later, a tense moment when she discovers herself responding to the anonymous groping of a man's hand in a crowded bus.
Nair's evocation of the ordinariness of a middle-class Brahmin family struggling to keep itself afloat in Chennai, hanging on to the rigid pattern of their lives, as exemplified in the patterns of kolam traced in front of their houses and expecting an unquestioning sacrifice from the women in the family to underwrite this myth, is what powers her narrative.
Akhila and her friends are on the threshold of self-discovery. The manner in which Nair relates these transformations is in turn revelatory and redeeming. Her tale is light enough to relieve the tedium of a long journey and yet filled with the incantatory power to burn up the tracks, to seek a new destination. To change."

When Raipur Mayor Kiranmayi Nayak, 46, clamped down on a pool party at the VW Canyon on August 25, many people called in to hail her for 'preserving' Chhattisgarh's morality. But it worries her now that her actions may have alienated thousands of younger voters. Nayak is keenly aware that small town India is changing rapidly, unblinking under a zillion flashing strobe lights and shaking a leg to whatever is booming on the speakers.
""What is the point of bringing in malls, five-star hotels and nightclubs if you're going to stand in the way of young people trying to have some fun?"" asks Abhishek Goswami, 25. He and his friend Swati Verma, 26, classmates through school and college and now inseparable on the dance floor whenever they chance upon one, can't fathom Nayak's vehement objections to an event as commonplace as a pool party.
Around 1,500 km to the north, Ludhiana is similarly abuzz with a brand-new nightclub culture that is drawing scores of young business tycoons and professionals. ""I hope this catches on,"" says 40-year-old Amit Jain, owner of export house Shingora Shawls. In just over a year the industrial hub has gone from being a purely private party town to being a place with multiple choices. The young tycoon and his French wife Isabelle are making the most of the new options.
Culturally akin to Ludhiana, Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh is also gearing up to meet the globally inspired sensibilities of its professionals and corporate scions who are back in the city with an overseas education and exposure to western nightlife. ""A Barista or a Cafe Coffee Day isn't enough,"" says Shagun Malhotra, 23, who launched her own nightclub, Dhuaan, to cater to people of her ilk.
The southern town of Coimbatore has found a neat way of straddling the divide between the still conservative local culture and western mores-a self-imposed midnight curfew. The dance floors empty out after young couples have had some hours to mingle. Hill-town Shillong, in India's North-east, similarly restricts its unabridged nightlife to weekends where Saturday night revellers head home just before sunrise.
Like metropolitan India, which learnt to work hard and party harder more than a decade ago, smalltown India is rocking with its own nights of bedazzling lights.

Saturday Night Special
Weekdays may be quiet, but fun brims over during the weekend
Idyllic amid fragrant pine forests, lilting strains of church music with local Khasi verse and an undying love for Bob Dylan. The good people of Shillong, Meghalaya, are learning to live beyond the town's picture postcard perfection. The erstwhile Himalayan outpost of the British Raj is being visited by a never before spectacle-Saturday night revelry that extends into the early hours of Sunday.
Larsing Sawyan, 34, popularly known as Hming, always wanted to recreate his happy times as an undergraduate student at Bangalore's St Joseph's College of Commerce. He started organising standalone discotheque nights at Centre Point, a hotel run by his father Prabhat Sawyan in Shillong. Kick-starting nightlife in a hill town ravaged by insurgency and used to sleeping by 7 p.m. seemed like a tall order. But the very first event he hosted in 1999 featuring two popular DJs, Yudhisthira and Aiven, was a smashing success. ""Over 350 people danced through the night,"" Hming recalls. It gave him the impetus to open Cloud 9, the North-east's first real discotheque in Shillong in 2002.
Unlike other small towns where night clubs remain an exclusive preserve of the affluent, Cloud 9's patrons in Shillong happily include a cross-section of townspeople. Income tax officer John Sangma, 57, and his wife Agatha, 50, simply love the prospect of a couple of drinks, listening to a mix of familiar retro and contemporary numbers even as spirited youngsters dance into the night. ""It's a great place to meet old friends and make new ones,"" Agatha says.
Not far across town in Laitumkhrah, similar scenes are unfolding at Deja vu, a new nightclub and lounge bar that has among its regular patrons Meghalaya Chief Minister Mukul Sangma. Started in 2009 by former Microsoft marketing manager Mark Rahmi Lyngdoh, 29, the place has quickly become the weekend choice of Shillong's Page 3 crowd. There's live music on Saturdays, where Lyngdoh and Phrang Kupar, 31, a professor of tourism studies at the Martin Luther Christian University, Shillong, belt out a medley of blues, jazz and the town's favourite genre-rock music. Patrons are encouraged to join in.
Shillong is yet to evolve beyond Saturday nights. Most clubs and bars down shutters by 10 p.m. on weekdays. But on the weekend, bereft of the usual clubhouse brawls, Shillong's nightclubs pride themselves on having created a discernibly woman-friendly environment. ""Female hostesses serve drinks. Women tend to be more comfortable with that,"" says Lyngdoh. It is getting close to 3 a.m. when Shillong's Women's College undergraduate students Zenifer Wary, 19, and Mitali Rabha, 20, who impressed all at Cloud 9 with their Shakira-like moves, decide to head home in their own cars. ""Women's safety has never been a concern here,"" says Wary, thankful for the familiarity a small town of 150,000 people brings.

Regional news headlines on August 26 screamed outrage over an event that would be commonplace in any metropolitan city: A bunch of 20- to 30-year-old youngsters guzzling beer and jiving to music at a private pool party at Raipur's lone five-star hotel, the VW Canyon, the night before. Barely an hour after the hawker had delivered the big news of the day, the moral police stepped in. This time, it was the Congress's one woman army in the Chhattisgarh capital.
""Ghatiya aur vaahiyaat (In bad taste),"" said Kiranmayi Nayak, Raipur's feisty mayor. ""Barely clad girls were photographed drinking and smoking cigars. Item girls (dancers) had been flown in from Nagpur and Mumbai. All this is alien to Chhattisgarhi culture.""

Music by demand
All out-of-town DJs charge anything between Rs 50,000 and Rs 100,000 for a night.
Many of the ""delinquent"" revellers were summoned by the police. District Collector Sidharth Komal Pardesi ordered a summary ban on all pool parties and slapped a 10 p.m. curfew on the city's bars and pubs. Swati Verma, 26, a Civil Services aspirant, is aghast. ""To me, the pool party only signals that Raipur's youngsters want to be part of a happening world,"" she says. Seated beside her at a coffee shop in the Central City Mall, Abhishek Goswami, 25, a social work student at Kushabhau Thakre University, says the administration's response is a scary sign of things to come.
Raipur, with a burgeoning population of over a million residents, is booming. The odd, ramshackle cinema halls have given way to plush multiplexes, which are a part of four huge malls, with five more under construction. It has more than 80 big and small hotels, all doing brisk business with steel, coal and power sector clients.
Sanjay Nair, 38, heads operations at the 1.35 million sq ft Magneto Mall, Raipur's largest. ""This place goes crazy on Sundays,"" he says, citing over 150,000 footfalls a day. Malls and multiplexes are the only source of entertainment in Raipur. They also make for a secure late-night environment in a city under threat from Naxalite insurgents.
The Canyon fiasco notwithstanding, Raipur's young are already finding their way back to nightlife haunts. Less than a fortnight after the incident, Ten Downing Street atop the Magneto Mall was beginning to draw back patrons. There are steady streams of weekend partygoers that throng Canyon's Club White, Club Marina at the Singapore City residential complex, the dance floor in Babylon Hotel and Fusion Bar at Jai Sthamb Chowk.
Residents predict the city will come of age with the completion of Naya Raipur-a brand-new 8,000-hectare township coming up 17 km from the present city. The Rs 2,000-crore project will house half a million people and be Chhattisgarh's cultural, educational and business hub. Prices of two-bedroom flats here have already hit the Rs 40-50 lakh band, proof that Raipur is changing irreversibly.

The leather town's elite pulls out all the stops on the entertainment highway

It's 2 a.m. on a hot and humid Saturday night. While partygoers, even in the bigger, more cosmopolitan metros decide to call it a night, revellers in Kanpur, intent on having a good time, are only warming up. At an upmarket address on Tagore Road, in the heart of the old cantonment area, Kanpur's swish set makes its way from shiny sedans and suvs to Dhuaan, the newest nightspot in town. The town's only Mediterranean bar and grill, Dhuaan is the current favourite address for its ubiquitous 'private parties'. Tonight, the city is preparing to host three such bashes.
Flush with cash, designer labels that would rival the French, endless supplies of rare imported spirits and an undying devotion to Bollywood: This is smalltown India at its lavish best. Money, as the leather town's hugely affluent elite will tell you, is no constraint. The latest fad, says avid partygoer and socialite Ronita Modi, 45, is to host exclusive bashes at downtown nightclubs instead of the usual sprawling suburban farmhouses; booking a floor for the night could cost up to Rs 250,000.
Draped in Gucci and Cavalli with Hermes or Louis Vuitton clutch bags carelessly discarded on couches, the crowd at Dhuaan is itching for a change of pace. Obligingly, the DJ ups the tempo. Dinner is only served short of sunrise at 4 a.m. Live saxophonists are now replacing the staple dance troupes and bands at dos in town.

Out with the old
In the old days, only married couples used to frequent clubs. Now, it's youngsters, irrespective of their relationship status.
Between recreating an iconic Vegas casino, flying in skimpily clad, pale-skinned Russian dancers, or better still, outsourcing the entertainment quotient to guest appearances by Bollywood stars like Emraan Hashmi and Abhay Deol, the average night-out in Kanpur tends to run up quite a bill. Harsh Bhutani, a local DJ, says he's performed at a do where the overall tab for a single night came to an incredible Rs 10 crore.
As Kanpur's most popular DJ, Bhutani employs his 'celebrity' status to bring affluent patrons to Felix, the city's oldest nightclub in Rave 3 Mall, which was recently re-launched for the fifth time by actor John Abraham. Entry to the swank party place is strictly through individual memberships, costing Rs 225,000 for five years.
Kanpur's elites from the leather, pan masala and detergent businesses spend big bucks to keep up appearances. It's a group that shuns the anonymity and impersonal nature of big-city life. Here, it is invariably a closed, privileged group that parties together, where the safety of women is seldom compromised.
Kanpur's young, with the ability to straddle both the modern and the traditional, have never had it better. Shagun Malhotra, 23, who returned after studying interior design in London, launched Dhuaan to fill in for an obvious lack of 'respectable' places for a night out. Her nightclub is a sell-out every Saturday night, booked several weeks in advance. ""Most of my contemporaries, like me, returned after completing degrees abroad. We needed night spots that matched our altered sensibilities,"" she says.
Malhotra's parents, Geeta and Vikas, who started Kanpur's first disco, Heels, 17 years ago, say the shift in outlook is no less than seismic. ""It was mostly married couples back then. Our children, single or attached, are now regulars at nightclubs,"" says Geeta. Ankit Nagory, a local business scion who recently flew home from New York, is thrilled with the ""sea change"" in popular attitudes. ""When I left, people here would only drink or smoke in the privacy of their homes,"" he says. ""Not anymore.""

It is the beginning of a new sexual revolution in small town Punjab. Young men on a happy high and young women dressed in mini-skirts and dresses with thigh-high slits, in wilful defiance of long prevailing sartorial mores, have created their very own safe havens: An exclusive chill-out zone in the very midst of Ludhiana's impossibly traffic-snarled streets.
""It's a great time to be alive,"" declares Sifti Riat, 25. A part-time manager at Akal Springs, a family run automotive parts enterprise, she cannot stop marvelling at how her once-boring hometown has metamorphosed. All this in the five years it took for her to complete her education in Delhi and Melbourne, Australia. ""Ludhiana today is just as cool as Melbourne,"" she says.
Riat and her friends wouldn't miss weekends at Bar 148, the township's trendiest nightclub. Located atop A-Hotel, a mid-range inn on Ferozepur Road, the place has just what the hip young crowd is looking for-""Good music, a floor where you can dance your pants off and an environment where women will not be judged because they are smoking and having a drink,"" she says.

""It was that or trips to Delhi and Mumbai,"" says Grewal, who opened Ludhiana's first 'couples only' nightclub with a lounge, a smokers' den, and a private dining area to pander to Punjab's vips. Balraj Singh, 24, a local entrepreneur, says, ""You can safely take your girlfriend or fiancee to Bar 148 without being accosted by drunken hoodlums.""
Transporter Sunny Johar, 42, and warehouse owner Jasdip Bindra, 30, somewhat nervously opened The Hub in June. Despite its unlikely location in the midst of the overcrowded Kumhar Mandi area, the four-storey nightclub, with a bar, a discotheque that boasts a one-of-its-kind CDJ 2000 mixer from Pioneer, a multi-cuisine restaurant, cafe lounge and rooftop dining, hasn't looked back. Bindra and Johar say The Hub is bringing in more cash than either of their family businesses ever did. ""It cost us just Rs 4 crore and eight months to set it up,"" says Johar.
At The Hub, Saturdays is celeb DJ night and sold out weeks in advance. The club opened to strains of Punjab's best known nightclub entertainers, Hari & Sukhmani. It continued to draw full house with DJs like Sharon, Jaya and the Trend Sisters. The biggest night to date was with Rabbi Shergill on August 4. ""Every inch of the 5,000 sq ft floor space was thoroughly tested,"" Bindra recalls. Bar 148's Grewal does not quite like talking money but says he ""could not be happier"".

""Club can't handle me!"" the final Flo Rida number quickly pulls once conformist Coimbatore's happy and suitably inebriated campers to the dance floor at the Bike & Barrel. It is the Saturday night crush before curfew is called close to midnight-and the last chance to dance away your blues.
That was the foot-stomping climax to another successful night at The Residency's popular restaurant and bar that doubles as a weekend nightclub. Twenty-five-year-old engineering student Alice Mujawase and Kwambo On, her Nigerian partner, delight onlookers with their loose-limbed 'dirty dancing'.

The growing stream of expatriates and regulars like businessman John Benedict, 32, grace the bar no less than three, even four times a week. Bike & Barrel gets as many as 150 dying-to-party customers on weekends despite its preferred 'couples only' policy.

The crowd is young-between 20 and 40 years old. ""Coimbatore gives me a sense of anonymity,"" says dentistry student Vinitha Kumar, 24, snuffing out a cigarette stub under her ballet shoe. It's impossible to have 'fun' at home in Chennai where she is constantly looking out for ""people who may know my parents"", she says. Her schoolteacher friend Radha Mahesh, 27, agrees that the city nightclubs are ""a good place to chill out where no one really cares what you're wearing"". But there is not a bare leg in sight at both Bike & Barrel and WXYZ. Coimbatore is still dressing conservatively in designer jeans, leggings and party tops.
The midnight curfew is sacrosanct here; the usual groans of inebriated frustration that accompanies the last dance missing. Business executive Shahil Mohammad, 26, agrees it is time to head home, because ""my girlfriend's dad would kill us both if we stayed out any later"".

WOMEN AT WORK: Confident participants at a district Sanchayika Sangh meeting WOMEN AT WORK: Confident participants at a district Sanchayika Sangh meeting
Some miracles are self-made. Stranded deep in Orissa's backwoods, Tapaswini Dhal's life was a bleak one and there was little hope of her seeing light in the years to come. With no electricity, her thatched home in Mayurbhanj descended into darkness every night and her husband's meagre earnings meant that her four children went hungry most of the time.Till the day she heard of women's self-help groups in the state and decided to join. Soon after, Dhal was able to set up a small rope-making unit. Over the months, the common fund to which she subscribed along with other women grew big enough for her to apply for a loan. The amount she wanted wasn't huge but it was sufficient for her to pay for a power connection at home. ""We haven't become rich,"" says Dhal. ""But the future looks brighter now.""Like Dhal, there are many other women leading anonymous lives in the remote regions of Orissa who are now daring to dream. Individually helpless, they have found strength in numbers by joining the self-help groups being set up under Mission Shakti, a statewide campaign launched last year by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik.The object of Mission Shakti is to facilitate the empowerment of women. ""It is as if a silent revolution is on,"" says Anu Garg of the state Government's Social Welfare Department, who heads the mission.Garg should know best. Her phones ring constantly with officials at ground zero reporting heartening stories: a self-help group in Odapada of Dhenkanal pooled in money to get an orphan girl married, in Khurda a group of women overpowered a suspected rapist who had managed to give the police the slip, in Chatrapur crooked contractors found themselves laid off as women took to laying roads, in Koraput, alcoholic husbands had been served ultimatums, and so the stories grow.Although a full-fledged campaign to form self-groups began only last year, the idea is not entirely new. Years ago in a unique experiment, an innovative district collector at Ganjam, Santosh Satpathy, encouraged women in his district to save money. The women were initially reluctant because few realised the value of savings.But with constant prodding, Satpathy managed to build a common pool, even accommodating women who could spare only Re 1 a day. Thus began a movement. As the groups grew in size and number, the kitty too grew fatter. By the last count, there were over 8,000 groups in Ganjam with over one lakh members who could boast of a total savings of around Rs 5 crore.Soon women began setting up their own businesses, such as brick kilns and units collecting and processing forest products. Some borrowed from the kitty while others approached banks for loans. With savings becoming a habit, loan defaults were a rarity and the size of the common fund remained healthy. The women discovered a new side to themselves. ""They were able to get back their voices,"" says Sanjeev Mishra, the current collector of Ganjam.Tales of the Ganjam women's success soon travelled to the neighbouring districts. The women of Atotapalli in Chatrapur too organised themselves into a group and set up a brick kiln. As profits trickled in, they began calling the shots. They recall how they stopped one of their husbands from going in for a second marriage. They even roped in the police to teach the man a lesson.Impressed by the developments in Ganjam and Chatrapur, Patnaik decided to give the self-help programmes an official boost. To make matters easier, Satpathy was now serving in the chief minister's secretariat itself. Using Satpathy's expertise, Patnaik soon kicked off Mission Shakti.Unlike states like Tamil Nadu where the Government spends around Rs 200 crore a year on similar self-help groups, the Orissa Government only helps build up credit linkages of the groups with the banks. The banks are only too willing to lend. ""With defaults as little as 2 per cent, our money is safe,"" explains Prasanna Kumar Behera of the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development.While women in Orissa have unarguably benefited from the programme, there have been gains for local politicians too. It was just as well for the chief minister that his assembly constituency was in Ganjam district. The scheme can only have widened his support base.By focusing on the formation of one lakh self-help groups, he has ensured the rock-solid backing of two million women in the state. ""The issue is not about reaping political dividends,"" insists Dharmendra Pradhan, a BJP MLA. ""It is about improving lives and empowering women."" Whatever the political motivation behind the scheme, the statewide campaign is bringing about unprecedented synergy among the women.In the one year that Mission Shakti has been at work, at least 29,000 additional self-help groups have sprung up over the state, from Nayagarh in coastal Orissa to Nowrangpur and Koraput districts deep in the tribal interiors. What's more, the women in these groups have managed to save Rs 6 crore so far, a fund from which they freely borrow and just as easily replenish.Rita Roy, a sociologist with the Bhubaneswar-based Utkal University, says Orissa's women are finally beginning to forge an identity of their own. It's true in more ways than one. For years, the women of Panijia were little more than voiceless entities. But ever since they grouped themselves into the Bana Durga Sayang Sanchayaka Sangh-the groups are generally named after reigning deities-the men ""comply with what we say"", smiles Rukmini Deo, one of the region's pioneer women.Although illiterate, Deo and other sangh members were clear that their children should be educated. So they went about planning a school in the village. While they provided the money for the structure, their men agreed to put it up free of cost. The school building at the centre of the village is a veritable landmark now. It not only stands as a tribute to the efforts of the women, but also holds the promise of a secure future for their children.It's a heartening example for other women so far trapped in poverty and illiteracy, unable to rise out of it or dream of a better future for their children. With their rope units and brick kilns, these women are building the road to hope in Orissa."
140,"Issue Date: May 20, 2002",[],2012-08-08 13:19:39,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"The sensational bust of big-time cocaine-seller Ali and businessman Neeraj Wadhera in Delhi last year may have exposed the city's social underbelly. But the most startling revelation was the number of coke-snorting women who figured among Ali's rich clients.
However, the case did nothing to dispel the widely held notion that women hooked to drugs belonged to two extreme ends of the social scale. One, a battered slum dweller or a humiliated sex worker for whom drug addiction means survival. The other, a rich, high society woman who copes with the ""pressures of a demanding life"" by taking drugs.
The glaring omission in the guesstimates was the number of educated, working, middle-class women hooked to drugs. Now, there are definite indicators based on recent trends. Two new studies released last week by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MSJE) and the South Asia regional office of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) as part of a national survey on drug abuse in India, bust the myths around ""the type of women who take drugs"". The theme is academic but the message is clear and alarming-drug abuse among women is not a fringe issue anymore.
A Rapid Assessment Study conducted in nine urban areas as part of the UNDCP project reveals that younger, educated women are more prone to drugs, unsafe injecting methods and sexual practices. One of the findings was that a large number of female drug users were single: 75 per cent in Hyderabad, 60 per cent in Thiruvananthapuram and 75 per cent in Goa.
The respondents from Goa were also highly educated (37 per cent were graduates). What may finally force one to look beyond cliched reasons for drug use is that taking drugs purely for pleasure was one of the reasons women cited for their addiction. The other study was conducted by Dr Pratima Murthy, associate professor of psychiatry at NIMHANS, Bangalore.
""The notion that women take drugs only because of stress is no longer the single, undisputed truth,"" she says, warning that the study figures should not be used to make generalisations about Indian society. However, she does agree that ""drug abuse is becoming popular in the urban middle classes, especially among those who represent India's phase of transition"".
It is also not just the snort of cocaine or the high of heroin that drives women, say mental health professionals. Abuse of prescription drugs from the benzodiazepine group like Alprax, Calmpose, Valium, Trika, Restill, Placedox and Alzolam is a growing trend.
Natasha Singh-the Delhi-based socialite who reportedly consumed a heavy dose of Alprax on a regular basis and died after a fall from a hotel in March this year-obviously wasn't a solitary example. ""I see four to six cases every day involving either dependence on sedatives or abuse,"" says Delhi-based psychiatrist Sanjay Chugh, who thinks escapism is an inescapable urge among urban drug users. Take Namita.
At 1.30 in the morning, just after a party, she realised she had run out of Calmpose. From a smart, amiable hostess in capris and figure-hugging top, Namita turned into an agitated woman who ""wanted"" Calmpose at any cost. ""I take it when I can't sleep, when I'm tense, even when I want to have sex. Sometimes, I take it in the middle of a tension-spiked working day as well. I just can't do without it,"" she says.
Murthy's study covered Delhi, Mumbai and Aizawl and the findings of women on drugs fit the new profile. While the maximum number of women are hooked to brown sugar (see box), other preferred drugs are narcotic analgesics, tranquillisers, alcohol, cough syrups and cannabis. A fact reflected often in the newsmaking trends of Delhi.
In Murthy's study, however, it was in the Manipur capital of Aizawl that narcotic analgesics were the most preferred. According to a Mumbai-based psychotherapist, cocaine is favoured in the city as compared to prescription drugs or sedative painkillers. ""Cocaine reflects status as it is an expensive party drug and women are not sucked into judgmental traps by others in their groups because everybody is using it,"" she says.
While most of the reasons behind women taking to drugs now mirror those of men, everyday life as a drug user or the journey into rehab and back to sobriety is lonelier and tougher for women. Sushma Bhatia*, a 37-year-old educated Delhi housewife, is an alcoholic and a drug addict with two kids and an alcoholic husband. Sharing her experiences in a women's chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Bhatia says her life as an alcoholic is far more devastating in terms of emotional and social consequences than a man's.
Bhatia took to alcohol seven years ago when one day ""I was feeling completely rotten about myself and the way my husband behaved with me after he got drunk"". She experimented with cocaine as well. Soon, she would start drinking after sending her kids to school. One day, after a near-nervous breakdown, she collapsed and had to be carried to a rehab centre.
""Women no longer take drugs only due to stress but also for pleasure.""
For 43-year-old Banita Muralidharan*, a corporate executive, the problem was only alcoholism. She was asked to quit on ""grounds of indecent behaviour"". Muralidharan, who is single, says her friends deserted her, making the urge to kick the addiction very difficult.
""Female addicts are seen as doubly deviant,"" explains Sheigla Murphy, director of the Center for Substance Abuse Studies at the California-based Institute for Scientific Analysis in a report published on the Internet.
This is because traditional expectations of a self-sacrificing woman are at variance with that of a woman so selfish as to use drugs for her own pleasure. Seema Kejriwal*, who, as a supportive wife of an alcoholic, attends AA meetings, agrees.
Kejriwal has stood by her husband, supporting him emotionally and financially for nine years as he battled with his addiction. ""We were reduced to poverty and I had to take a job to support us, leaving my two-year-old son with a man who could not tell the day from night,"" she says, adding that she is fully aware of the fact that had she been in the same situation, her husband would have thrown her out long ago.
Compounding these problems are the effects of drugs on the physical and mental health of women. Studies have proved that women have a higher risk than men to addiction to certain drugs such as crack cocaine, even after casual or experimental use. In Murthy's study, respondents reported insomnia, menstrual irregularities, depression and anxiety.
Some even suffered miscarriages or were forced to undergo pregnancy terminations. ""Pregnant women who take alcohol or abuse drugs,"" says Delhi-based gynaecologist Sohani Verma, ""are also more prone to having children with congenital defects or Foetal Alcohol Syndrome.
While pregnant women on drugs can go into premature labour, babies suffering from FA S are usually underweight and often have defects such as mental retardation, delayed development and, as they grow older, behaviour problems. A scary price to pay for a ""kick"" that only briefly masks the pain of reality."

If there exists an Indian cyberporn industry, Chennai could well claim to be its capital. While Kollywood remains the body shop of Malayalam soft porn movies, which are dubbed into other Indian languages, cyberporn has graduated to a fledgling industry. All it takes are a few ""actors"" and a cameraman in a secluded bungalow rented out for film and TV serial shoots.
In December 2001, the Chennai Police arrested Dr Prakash, a seemingly respectable orthopaedic surgeon who found the lure of cyberporn more tempting than his profession. Prakash ran a pornographic clinic, complete with actors, directors and cameramen on the outskirts of Chennai, supplying video clips and photographs of women to porn sites registered in the US.
Investigations have been on for three years but no outcome is in sight. The Chennai Police have registered at least five similar cases over three years, but the supply of ""authentic South Indian hotties"" has continued.
Porn material from Chennai is provided to sites via East Asian countries like Malaysia and Singapore through digital transmission and CDs. Bits of footage from porn movies are also sold at the rate of Rs 50 per foot in places like Meeran Sahib Street. More than 40 dealers of porn videos and pictures have been arrested by the police in the past six months.
Sources say that women actors are promised anonymity as the videos go only to foreign countries, but once on the web the footage is accessible everywhere. Says C. Sylendra Babu, deputy commissioner of police, North Chennai: ""We have found that such shoots happen in bungalows usually rented out for film shooting.
Last year we arrested a crew along with five women. These women often take alcohol before they act."" Places around Kodambakkam are the hotspots of these creations.
After the Information Technology Act came into force in 2001, Tamil Nadu constituted a Cyber Cell to deal with online crime, but the local police continues to deal with porn video rackets. Says a police officer: ""When the websites are registered and operate from a foreign country there is nothing much we can do.
The local police deal with the production of such pornographic material while the Cyber Cell looks into complaints regarding unsolicited and indecent e-mails and related crimes."""

Moni Dutta is not on the model list, but is Raghavendra Rathore's in-house muse during IFW. The Assamese beauty has just returned from a European stint.
India Shining sun tan India Shining sun tan
Is fashion getting smarter as designers try to get attention? An ""India Shining"" sun tan bottle is part of Kiran Uttam Ghosh's press kit.
First Timers
After the discovery of Sabyasachi, new designers are watched closely. Varun Bahl's diffusion line, with detailed embellishments, should be well attended for a debut.
Despite the noise designers make, there remains a strong suspicion that audiences turn up to watch not the clothes, but those they hang on.The model is the weakest link in the commerce of fashion, yet she is the most visible. Models epitomise what Christian Dior famously called the ""New Look"". They are a reflection of, for what it's worth, what ""beauty"" will be in vogue next.Fashion projection has, at different times, glamorised, objectified, celebrated and humiliated women. The supermodel on the international runway was haughty and untouchable.At the peak of the Tom Ford nightclubber days, she wore hideously expensive clothes, but still managed to look dirty. Gianni Versace invented hooker chicon his runway, which was followed by the darker days of John Galliano when women were objects of fetish fantasies.
On Indian runways, the couture years saw the rise of the touch-me-not, aloof, exotic supermodel. In the recent pret past, the bad boys of fashion brought her down to earth. Often with a thud.
Manish Arora gave her the ""socked eye look"" in the early days of the India Fashion Week (IFW) when in runny overused mascara, she walked down the rampas if she was on her way to Alcoholics Anonymous.
So what's the look of the Lakme India Fashion Week, which begins this year on April 27? According to most experts, it is a complicated one. ""The look swings between extremes of reality and extremes of fantasy,"" says stylist Yatin Ahluwalia who, along with partner Jojo, works on the runway look at IFW.
Unlike the nude lipstick-wearing, straight-haired, natural, if vacuous Kaif beauty, she is still cheerful, but a lot more cerebral. She is part goddess, part goof. She is mostly happy, but can bite. She is Indian, but could live anywhere. She is a whole package, rather than a part.
""It's a sophisticated cheeriness. The best way to put it would be beauty with a twist,"" says Ahluwalia. Part of it reflects the sartorial adventure that Indian designers are on. While being steeped in Indian craft and textiles in fabric and technique, they are combining many elements in their work.
Ashish Soni is influenced by Zen, Rahul Khanna and Rohit Gandhi are inspired by the Sloane Ranger English tweeds, while Morocco seems to be coming up in the works of designers as diverse as Ranna Gill and Ashima-Leena.
""This is a woman who cannot be contained in definitions, she has her own opinions and ideas of style, but unlike the 1980s power dresser of the West, she is much less aggressive and severe in her attitude,"" says Ahluwalia.
Dishevelled hair is in, rather than the combed-to-the-scalp neatness of the past year. The mouth is asking for attention, rebelling against the nude tone niceties of the recent past.
The eyes are defined once more. While retro chic also returns to international runways- Galliano led the look with his ""grannies from hell"", over-painted models inspired by the '50s, headed for a naughty night out-some insist that good old world glamour fits in just as well in the Indian context.
Raghavendra Rathore, a designer more in the classic mould, says, ""As malls mushroom and retail and real estate join hands to create more room for fashion, the industry is riding on their own version of feel-good. Fashion is celebrating sophistication and good old dressing up is nothing to be ashamed of."" His model, he says, will be the classic Indian beauty of the '50s' Bollywood, but scratch the surface and there is a raunchy diva just waiting to get out.
Runway Tips
Ringlets and texturing are big. Throw out the straighteners. Orange, pink and other colours replace nude in lipstick. The eyes are defined again. Blended two-tone colour is hot. Use sheen, gleam and glow. Translucent is back.
Arora, with his penchant for the over-the-top, will exaggerate the same theme. The hair will be voluminous enough to house a bird's nest, the mouth will be inviting red. This woman enjoys attention. ""There is an aggressive sexiness with a hint of stylishness,"" says Arora.But according to him, it is the subdued nightclub sensibility of Tokyo rather than the sluttiness of New York. ""She is sensual, but mischievous and romantic as well."" Her clothes fit the look: contemporary silhouettes with prints inspired by newborn babies, cartoons and romantic roses.The twist shows up again with fellow shocker Narula. ""She wears chiffon slipdresses with velvet track pants. Her look reflects this contradiction: she is pretty, but not too pretty, she is chic but fun, and she is all these things at the same time."" While Kumar did well as the blank bombshell, designers say she has enough mystery and mischief for the new look.The model who is on top of the heap, charging Rs 18,000 per show, will continue to be a show-opener by all accounts. Insiders say Michelle Innes too can suit the role, as can former Miss India, the now-nice-now moody Poonam Nath.Jesse Randhawa's has-she-got-ants-inher-pants excitability might be too strong for the look and last year's favourite Bhawna Sharma may be too full of fun to be every man's fantasy. For more, just wait for the frontrow view."
143,Women victims become culprits,[],2012-03-28 13:15:12,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"In February this year the police in Noida deliberately released the identity of a 17 year-old rape victim in clear violation of the law. This disclosure was followed by a statement regarding the supposed 'consent' of the girl in the act of partaking of alcohol with the alleged rapists just before she was raped. How does one read this? That a 'bad' girl, identified as interested in alcohol and partying, is tarnishing the image of 'good' boys, who were merely having a good time?
Rape
And how come every time there is an act of sexual violence against a woman these ideas of 'good' and 'bad' come to be part of our mindscape? Of course the morality discourse is resurrected only when the crime gets reported-otherwise no one really cares. Otherwise rape, whether we like it or not, is a part of our daily reality-in cities, villages, at the workplace and at home. What's so new about the Gurgaon rape of a 23-year-old that we have not heard before?
There is a lot that we have heard before though: late night shifts at 'dubious' workplaces, such as bars and restaurants; wearing improper attire; travelling alone on lonely roads. This particular reasoning that identifies the woman as the perpetrator of a crime against herself extends beyond rape, but is limited exclusively to women. So, Soumya Vishwanathan's death while driving back home at 3.30am was also asking for it. Every government functionary from the politician to the police believes it is so, then it must be true.
High time women accepted that they are not victims, but the reason why rape happens. The moment a woman steps out of the home, for whatever reasons, she is inviting the wrath of a whole social system that is trying to 'protect' her for themselves. She is representative of so much more than just herself. After all in India the woman is mother, daughter, sister and wife-to a man. To want to go out, step out of the frame to claim her space is inconceivable and must be checked.
No wonder then that in a reading of the Lok Sabha debates on the Rape Law of 1983, sociologist Pratiksha Baxi finds that rape treats the man as subject, and the woman as object. The rape is not about her, but about the violation of a male code.
This is reflected in the discussion on the law which tries to distinguish between the chaste and unchaste woman, the married and unmarried woman, and the raped women and the 'normal' woman.
The control over reproduction creates these categories-so, a 'protected' woman is the married mother. Baxi adds that in patriarchal societies where descent defines the woman's place--rape literally defiles the descent line. It's a crime by men against men.
Every time a woman comes to report a rape, or every time the police have to answer questions on rape, they commit a double crime on the rape survivor. The courts do it again when they hear her testimony. The state rapes its women with their questions, interrogations and insinuations about character and conduct.
But what is it about cities that attract such power struggles--for that is exactly what rape is-an act of violence to reclaim lost 'power'. In contemporary India, the city space has been way more welcoming of women than any other. Its anonymity adds to the freedom that numbers bring.
Spaces
The growing need for a workforce helped us get out, and work towards reclaiming the public. But according to a report by the NGO Jagori, it is these very urban spaces that are now potential cover for crimes against women. So many of the places we inhabit in our daily lives are fraught with danger. Low street lighting, narrow lanes, public alcohol dens all add to our misery.
It is indeed a sad commentary that many of the rapes in Delhi happen very close to where the rape victim lives, by someone she knows.
A report cites how often people one may know and trust-neighbours, relatives, friends, colleagues-may exploit our trust. Lifts in cars with acquaintances have often been cited in cases of rape. The tinted, moving car is the perfect space for this kind of violence--the speed adds to the 'thrill'.
Police
The fast life of the city affects both women and men-like the toll booth operator who got shot last year for asking for the toll, or the recent case of a bouncer who was beaten up outside a city hotel for having denied entry to some patrons to a night club. Does the city breed this kind of mentality-of intolerance, impatience and violence?
In a panel discussion on a news channel following the incident of violence against the toll booth operator, one of the panelists spoke of the feeling of 'entitlement' that the city's youth feel they have towards the right to have a 'good' time.
Anyone who comes in the way of their enjoyment is taking away their right, and must be accordingly treated. Thus women who are out at night working, partying, on an emergency, whatever it might be, are 'easy pickings'. If she resists then she is impinging upon their right.
Perhaps the saddest commentary of our times is when fathers in their anxiety and worry over the safety of their daughters 'laud' the efforts of the police to curb the time till which a woman can work at night-8pm in Gurgaon after the recent case. Or when they silently agree with the vitriolic that law enforcers spew about clothing and 'decency'. It is at these times that a woman truly comes to feel like a culprit herself."
144,US soldier who massacred 16 Afghans identified,[],2012-03-17 17:12:53,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"Five days after shrouding his name in the cloak of military secrecy, the American soldier who went on a shooting rampage killing 16 Afghan civilians, including nine children in villages in Kandahar was identified as Staff Sgt Robert Bales.
Bales, who arrived at a US military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas from Kuwait after his arrest is a father of two children who underwent anger management counselling, a decade ago.
The soldier has been identified as Staff Sgt Robert Bales, a senior US official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation.
The US military has not named him officially. Pentagon says its policy is to wait until a soldier is charged. He faces possible criminal charges, Pentagon officials said.
""Bales is a 38-year-old staff sergeant, husband, father of two young children and a veteran who was in the midst of his fourth tour in a war zone. John Henry Browne, a defence attorney from Seattle, confirmed his client's identity,"" the Fox news channel reported.
Browne said the sergeant, now living in Washington state, has two children three and four. The sergeant's family says they saw no signs of aggression or anger. ""They were totally shocked"" by accounts of the massacre, Browne said. ""He's never said anything antagonistic about Muslims. He's in general very mild-mannered,"" he was quoted as saying by the news channel.
Browne, who said he has met with the family and talked with the suspect, cited a need to protect family members in declining to release the soldier's name.
The news channel said reporters swarmed Bales' neighbourhood in Lake Tapps, in Washington state on Friday night in the rural community, a wooded area filled with pine trees about 20 miles northeast of the base.
The soldier went on a shooting spree, killing 16 civilians, including nine children in Afghanistan last week, had ""snapped"" under high stress of long combat tours, familial tensions and alcohol.
Bales, said to have received sniper training, is assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, of the 2nd Infantry Division, which is based at Lewis-McChord and has been dispatched to Iraq three times since 2003, military officials say. During the suspect's time in Iraq, Browne said, the soldier was injure.
According to Browne, Bales was ""highly decorated,"" but did not provide any specifics.
Bales is reported to have completed 20 hours of anger- management counselling following a 2002 arrest at a hotel for investigation of assault. Browne told the Fox news that the case involved a woman who was not his wife.
It was not immediately clear how long Bales has been married to his wife."

World's cheapest michelin star
Does this look like a Michelin three-star restaurant? Well, it is.
Does a Michelin three-star restaurant mandatorily need to be a white-tablecloth temple of elevated gastronomy? The world may think so, but the culinary world's Oscars don't only go to stiff upper-lip restaurants with hyper-inventive chefs and high investments in dcor.
In Hong Kong, the Michelin inspectors, anonymous and working in complete secrecy, just awarded a three-star rating to a dim sum restaurant that you'd miss if you were in a hurry. Tucked away in Kowloon's crowded Mongkok district, Tim Ho Wan has the distinction of being one of the cheapest Michelin-star restaurants in the world, and in the three-star category, it is in the pricey company of Caprice and Lung Kung Heen, both at the Four Seasons hotel, and the Joel Robuchon in Macau.
It was a Lung Kung Heen chef who opened Tim Ho Wan because he wanted to serve quality dim sum at the cheapest prices (the Hong Kong dollar equivalent of Rs50-200 a basket) and there isn't a moment when the restaurant doesn't have a serpentine queue of waiting guests outside. A friend who visited the restaurant last month said you'd be better off taking a thriller along with you if you intend to drop by at Tim Ho Wan. With an average wait of three hours, you could easily count on finishing Grisham's or Baldacci's latest before your turn finally comes.
Erin de Santiagio, who writes The Art of Backpacking blog, offers a helpful tip. Reach the restaurant, which is in a workingclass district crowded with highrise apartment blocks spilling over with matchbox-like flats, at least half an hour before opening time. ""The shop is not easy to spot, but ? look for everyone else lined up at what seems to be a tiny storefront,"" writes de Santiago. ""It's not always easy to get the hostess's attention, but be sure you secure a number right away or you might find yourself behind 20 other parties within five minutes."" Here's a poor man's El Bulli and the world just seems to be loving it.

Wine lovers happy with milder kick
Bordeaux's elite may not approve of the young who want less alcohol in wines.
Wine may not remain the same anymore if producers start listening to the market more than they have been. A survey conducted for German wine trade fair ProWein and reported by Decanter.com shows that consumers in four countries across three continents - the US, UK, Germany and China - favour a lower alcohol content. That's one sentiment we, the nation of super strong beer, may find blasphemous, but the world seems to be heading the other way.
The ideal wine, according to 1,000 random consumers surveyed by Wine Intelligence, should have less than 12 per cent of alcohol. Surprisingly, young people, especially women, are the most vocal about their preference for wines with lower alcohol levels - in China, an overwhelming majority of the respondents rooted for an alcohol level in the range of 5.5 to 8 per cent. At present, the levels range from 10.5 to 14.5 per cent.
The survey comes at a time when alcohol levels, especially in wines from warmer countries such as Australia and Chile, are rising worryingly. The upper limit of the alcohol percentage has touched 15.5 per cent - experts blame it on global warming - and some suspicious critics even insist in private that it has gone up to 16.5 per cent, but producers are not announcing it on their labels yet.
Why's everybody getting so worked up about alcohol levels? Wine is meant to be drunk with food. Higher alcohol levels play havoc on taste buds, so wine producers all over keep them within the established range. But the industry is now looking for validation to bring the levels down to single digits so as to get tax breaks and more women consumers. Being an old-school wine lover, I just hope better sense prevails over the industry."

- J.J. Cale
Celebrities, rock stars, A-list clubs, parties, and a feel-good drug called cocaine. It's been a stimulating cocktail since the 1970s, when the so-called 'recreational' drug found favour with the smart set, encouraged by lyrical endorsements from rock legends like Eric Clapton who gave J.J. Cale's original a new lease of life-along with the intoxicant. It wasn't just rock stars.
In 1984, The New York Times ran an article, ""Cocaine: The Champagne of Drugs"", featuring three prominent users: Sigmund Freud, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Pope Leo XIII. Cocaine, unlike heroin, acquired the reputation of a chic, harmless drug for celebrities. Rolling Stone magazine called it ""America's star-spangled powder.""
India has been slow to snort. The white revolution saw a spike in popularity in the late 1990s but, as the Rahul Mahajan case reveals, it's now part of a blossoming but clandestine scene involving mainly the rich and the young, successful entrepreneurs, business scions and high-salaried professionals who start to 'do' cocaine as a fashion statement and then discover it's a euphoric way to de-stress and extend party hours.
Coke, as they call it, has replaced other drugs as the favoured social lubricant among affluent urban Indians who largely view it as a recreational, good-time high. ""Cocaine has become a determinant of surplus money,"" says Sanjay Chugh, psychiatrist and de-addiction expert.
Concurs Dr Yusuf Merchant, President of the Drug Abuse Information Rehabilitation and Research Centre in Mumbai: ""Cocaine is people's way of announcing 'We've arrived'. Earlier, a rocking party was Black Label and expensive wines. Today, a high society party will have cocaine. It immediately elevates your status on the party circuit.""
Cocaine and Party highs As pills, powder or packed in vials, these drugs are common in high society gigs COCAINE: a.k.a. coke, flake, Charlie and snow, is a crystalline alkaloid obtained from coco leaves. It resembles white powder and is usually divided into lines on a smooth surface and snorted using a rolled up currency note or a straw. It is a stimulant for the central nervous system. Cocaine is bad for anybody with high blood pressure or a heart condition. Price: Rs 3,000-5,000 for 1 gm. ECSTASY: A synthetic, psychoactive drug chemically similar to the stimulant methamphetamine and mescaline. It comes in the form of pills, although it can also be sold in powder form. Acts both as a stimulant and psychedelic, producing an energising effect, as well as distortions in time and perception. Some evidence suggests it can damage the brain. Price: Rs 600 per tablet. LSD: Commonly called acid, it is a semisynthetic psychedelic drug colloquially measured in 'hits' or 'tabs'. It causes expansion and alters experience of senses, emotions and awareness for eight to 14 hours. It may also produce strange visual effects. The drug sometimes spurs long-term or even permanent changes in a user's personality. Price: Rs 70 per tab. CRACK: A smokeable form of cocaine made into small lumps or rocks. It is a stimulant with short-lived effects. It's smoked in a pipe, glass tube or foil, known as freebasing. Regular users can become physically and psychologically dependent. Crack users can die of overdose. Risk increases if mixed with heroin, barbiturates or alcohol. Price: Rs 1,000 for 1 gram. HEROIN: A natural opiate made from the opium poppy. It comes as a white powder when pure. It can be smoked, snorted or dissolved in water and injected. Over time, the desired effects reduce so users have to take more to get the same effect. Long-term effects cause 'craving' and strong psychological and physical dependence. Excessive doses can lead to coma and even death from respiratory failure. Price: Rs 500 for 1 gram. SPEED: Amphetamine, often used as a substitute to cocaine. Boosts energy and suppresses appetite. Can keep user awake for up to 12 hours. Used a lot by students studying for exams or those who work long hours. Highly addictive with debilitating after-effects. Price: Rs 10 per tablet.
Sniffing and snorting from atop glass tables and bathroom tiles in the homes and farmhouses of the rich, young and almost-famous is a fairly recent phenomena. Till the mid-1990s, its use was restricted to the 30- and 40-somethings, also the rich and very Page 3, but primarily those who had had stints abroad or travelled to the West frequently.
Around a decade ago, say narcotics officials, there were about 1,000 users each in Delhi and Mumbai. It was a tight, restricted circle of-not rich, young brats looking for new ways to chill, but sophisticated, married couples aware of what they were doing and confident of their ability to handle themselves under its influence. No wild parties, orgies or frenzied snorting. Just a cool thing to do, discreetly.
The kind of A-list that 'did' cocaine was first revealed in 2001 with the arrest in Delhi of a prominent hotelier and party person for buying cocaine from Afghan drug peddler Naquibullah, a.k.a. Ali. Ali's interrogation revealed he was catering to 10 high-society groups in Delhi and Mumbai comprising the Page 3 swish set, including lawyers, industrialists, political scions, prominent fashion designers and Bollywood stars.
Today, that list reads vastly different. In cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, rich young kids dominate the scene, turning it into a psychedelic free-for-all where the dangers of prolonged cocaine use are ignored in favour of the status and extraordinary rush that cocaine brings to the table. As India's urban affluence spreads, so does the number of coke users.
According to data collected by Merchant's drug centre, the number of cocaine users has shot up by almost 300 to 400 per cent in the past four years. In Mumbai and Delhi, there are at least 50,000 people hooked to party drugs like cocaine.
A disturbing trend is the drop in the age of individuals experimenting with party drugs like coke to 16 and 17 year olds. After the first snort, it takes at least six to seven years for users to even realise they are addicted.
Another recent development is the increasing number of women doing party drugs to win acceptance on the party circuit. Cocaine use, say officials, has become especially rampant in the past two years.
Unfortunately for today's get-highquick young brigade, the dangers are lesser known than the effects: Bibek Maitra's death only underscores that. However, a majority of the young party crowd in cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore seem secure in the belief that since they use coke as an 'occasional drug' on weekends, it's perfectly safe. That's a dangerous misconception.
While coke is certainly less harmful than heroin or crack (see box), it's an insidious, socially-induced dependence. Most cocaine users are within the 25 to 34 age group, looking, like much else in their lives, for instant gratification. So long as it is used occasionally and within limits, cocaine is not a lethal drug. What makes it lethal is overuse, addiction and infusion with other intoxicants like heroin and excessive liquor. The risk is higher for first-time users with medical problems. Investigation into Maitra's death suggests that the cocaine he used had been mixed with heroin.
Ironically, the night Maitra and Mahajan were rushed to the Apollo Hospital, another party was in full swing in a south Delhi farmhouse. Mukesh Kapoor, son of a Bangalore industrialist, was celebrating his 32nd birthday with friends. At the party, one invitee confided to INDIA TODAY, the 'cake' was 30 gm of cocaine heaped on the centre-table. First, Mukesh rolled up a Rs 500 note and did two monster lines. His friends followed suit.
The resulting high is common to the concentric social circles of Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and Goa. Other cities like Chandigarh and Pune, besides affluent enclaves like Gurgaon and Noida, have also witnessed a spurt in cocaine use but it's not as alarming as in the three metros.
Coke on call: Abdullah who supplied coke to Rahul Mahajan Coke on call: Abdullah who supplied coke to Rahul Mahajan
As in the West, there are certain industries in India where cocaine use is almost part of the job: fashion designing, advertising, public relations, the music industry, Bollywood (as the Fardeen Khan case revealed) and modelling.
For the high-fliers in these sectors, socialising into the wee hours is routine. And coke, inevitably, is de rigueur. In the past five years, young entrepreneurs and business scions have literally usurped the lead on the snorting circuit, indulging in it as a necessary social lubricant.
""There's nothing like a few lines of coke to lift you up on a Friday night,"" confesses Rahul K., 26, a Delhi-based interior designer. ""I work 13 hours a day and, after a tiring week, I need the rush to keep me going for the weekend. It gives me confidence in social situations.""
Many young people ""do coke"" under peer pressure: it's exceedingly difficult for a young man to not do what others are doing. (You can't fake by not inhaling the coke.) Principals of leading schools and colleges also point to a fair degree of cocaine use among students, especially those from international institutes run for British and American kids.
Unlike alcohol-induced intoxication, coke's popularity as a party drug has soared because it unleashes sensations that are exactly the opposite: superman energy, exhilaration, a sense of freedom and supremacy, and stress release.
Cocaine releases massive amounts of the hormone noradrenaline which in turn unlocks an instantaneous, amphetamine-like rush of confidence, elation and exhilaration. Animated and intense talking, fuelled by a surge of well-being and invincibility are common. The intensity, however, does not last long, requiring three or four lines of coke over an evening.
The reason why it's a drug for the affluent is because it's an expensive habit. Consider this. One gram of the Class A drug can make around 10 to 15 lines for snorting which can last two people anything from a couple of hours to an entire night-depending on their tolerance and the purity of the stuff. A reputed dealer will sell a gram of pure cocaine for around Rs 7,000, but the normal price for cocaine in India is between Rs 3,000 and 4,000 per gram.
EARLIER, A ROCKING PARTY WAS BLACK LABEL AND FANCY WINES. TODAY, THE HIP CROWD HAS FREE-FLOWING COKE.
Part of the reason cocaine is not seen as a debilitating drug in India is because it's not a home-grown product and partly because it is considered less harmful than other drugs like crack or heroin. Over 80 per cent of the world's cocaine comes from South America.
India, on the other hand, is emerging as a major transit point for drugs like heroin from the Golden Triangle (Myanmar, Laos and Thailand) and the Golden Crescent (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran). The international drug mafia brings cocaine into India from South America via Hong Kong and uses the same couriers or containers to smuggle out heroin to the US and Europe.
Last week, in what law-enforcement authorities claim is the biggest ever cocaine haul in India, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) seized 200 kg of the drug from a cargo vessel at Panvel port near Mumbai. The consignment, hidden in containers, was worth over Rs 90 crore in the local market. Officials say the consignment was lifted from Colombia, transported to Hong Kong and, finally, brought to Mumbai.
Narcotics officials say that in Delhi alone 1.5 to 2 kg of cocaine is sold every week. That's a lot of noses glued to the glass top. Cocaine use among the young, affluent sections of society is reaching endemic proportions, especially in Bangalore, where highsalaried techies are taking to it like, well, skiers take to another kind of white powder.
""What has perhaps led to this rise is the increasing glamorisation of drugs, accessibility, availability and pressure to stand out among the youth,"" says Dr Samir Parikh, head of the psychiatry wing of Max Healthcare, Delhi. The changing dynamics between parents and teenagers has also resulted in an air of leniency and a marked increase in the consumption of drugs.
DANGERS OF PROLONGED COCAINE USE ARE IGNORED IN FAVOUR OF THE STATUS AND EXTRAORDINARY RUSH IT GIVES.
For well-heeled 20-somethings, snorting coke has become as common as smoking pot was in the 1970s. ""People who take coke flaunt it because it's just so damn expensive,"" says Amit Nag, 24, who works for an MNC in Delhi.
Agrees Alok Sarin, psychiatrist at Sita Ram Bhartia Hospital in Delhi: ""This trend of 20-somethings trying coke is not surprising. What has changed over the years is the accessibility and availability of cocaine.""
One of the key reasons for the decline in the age group of first-time coke users is the vast amount of disposable income. A classic example is the BPO industry, where just-outof-college rookies, earning six figure salaries and working in a time warp, resort to drugs as a means to keep going through the night.
Delhi and Mumbai societies also have a somewhat laidback approach to cocaine. During the annual fashion week parties, there's an unending queue of models, designers and socialites filing into the bathroom to do a line of whites. According to narcotics sleuths, in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, the hippest clubs and restaurants are prime locations for buying cocaine. In September 2005, Dev Chopra, 27, was caught selling 15 gm of cocaine for Rs 65,000 to a couple outside one of Delhi's most popular restaurants, around the same time that Provogue owner Salil Chaturvedi was arrested in Mumbai for possessing two vials of cocaine.

However, most of the hip, young, affluent crowd still prefer the relative anonymity of their farmhouses where weekend parties rev up after rows of Charlie-as cocaine is locally referred to-are snorted in the bathrooms. The music, the coke, the vodka shots, the dance floor, all merge into one dazzling blur.
The energy and euphoria induced by cocaine ensures that the party winds up only when the sun peeps over the horizon. Raves present another popular coke-snorting scene, usually held at private residences, beaches or specific farmhouses.
There are two types of coke users. The recreational ones, young people from affluent classes, use it during weekend parties. They spend an average of Rs 50,000 per week on the drug or 1 gm per person. Some add ecstasy tabs to cocaine to heighten the effect and enhance sexual performance.
The second type of cocaine users are the addicts: they consume an average of 1 gm a day. The key area of concern involves addicts who refuse to accept that they are hooked and later face serious psychological and physical problems, not to mention financial troubles. For addicts with a-gram-a-day habit, the monthly expenditure would be well over Rs 1 lakh.
Cocaine popular among rich and young Cocaine popular among rich and young
For first timers, it's not that difficult to get hold of the cell number of a supplier; sometimes a cryptic password is passed on by an existing consumer. Once the new consumer calls the supplier and gives the password, he becomes part of the chain. This works as a reference system. The reference system works whether you are in Mumbai or Delhi. Either Maitra or Mahajan was aware of coke dealer Abdullah's cell number in Delhi.
The easy availability of cocaine in Delhi is best illustrated by 27-year-old Sanjeev Kashyap who told INDIA TODAY: ""I was at a party organised by a friend, a model by profession, three months ago. I saw cocaine in five different places, served like slices of cake. I sniffed it with a rolled-up note and after that it was as if I was dancing in heaven.""
Heaven actually happens almost every weekend at parties organised in various locations in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore. These parties, attended by the young, rich, hip crowd, have created a new subculture, almost a way of life. ""It is a matter of great concern that among the elite class, the consumption of cocaine has increased,"" says DGP, Narcotics, A.S. Cheema.
According to narcotics officials, in the National Capital Region, cocaine worth Rs 1 crore is sold every week. No exact statistics exist pertaining to cocaine usage. But if only 10 per cent of drug seizures is applied, the annual consumption of the drug in just Pune, Mumbai and Delhi is between 30 and 40 kg.
What gives cocaine its unique cachet is that, unlike other drugs, it has found favour with celebrities, authors and rock stars. Before Maitra, India never had a high-profile case of death due to cocaine use. The largest users of cocaine are males aged between 18 and 25 who write it off, mistakenly, as a high like alcohol, only better.
""There's something of a separate high in going to the loo with a friend and giving him a line of coke,"" says Sanjeev Suri, partner in a well-known architect firm. ""It's an act of bonding but it's also a bit naughty. No one in my crowd thinks of it as breaking the law. We're just having fun.""
Medical experts mostly differ on just how harmful the drug truly is. Despite its reputation, cocaine is neither irresistible nor inescapable. The occasional cocaine user need not become addicted if will-power and awareness are judicially used. It's the heavy, habitual use of cocaine that can cause problems. Excessive use can lead to paranoia, depression, social isolation, family disruption and problems at work.
What's helping it get out of hand is social peer pressure, a desire to belong to the 'right' crowd and enhance status, together with the kind of disposable income that today's young people have and, more crucially, the lack of parental supervision. ""Money is often used as a surrogate for affection,"" says Chugh. ""It is a buffering affect that 'good' parents think they are providing. Which is why when faced with a child with a substance abuse problem, the first reaction is denial.""
RICH PARENTS USE MONEY AS A SURROGATE FOR AFFECTION. THEIR REACTION TO DRUG USE BY THEIR KIDS IS USUALLY DENIAL.
Besides, unlike drugs like heroin, the effects of cocaine are psychological, without any physical symptoms. However, coke is wrongly termed a recreational drug: there can be no recreational use for something that hurts you in the long run.
Take the case of Vishal, 25, a cocaine addict from Mumbai now undergoing rehabilitation. ""I started taking cocaine when I was 16. My friends did coke and it was the 'cool factor' that drew me to it,"" he recalls. ""We would party three times a week. Money was never a problem, and my parents never asked how I spent it. Coke boosted my confidence and increased my awareness. After a while, I became dependent on the drug without realising it. My relationships with family and friends changed. I lost contact with reality.""

Bangalore-based psychologist and youth counsellor Vernas Mascarenhas observes, ""Ten years ago, kids did drugs because of bad company or broken homes. Today, only the affluent do drugs, successful people who don't realise the damage they are doing to their bodies and minds. It's a collective and social problem.""
Yet, for most young users, party drugs like cocaine have become a fashion accessory, much like expensive cellphones, diamond-studded watches and the Armani gear. Their money brings with it a false bravado, an invincibility that allows them to stretch limits without paying heed to the warning signs. The trouble with party drugs like cocaine is that the warning signs are muted. There are no cramps, no bloodshot eyes, no physical discomfort, no slurring and disorientation, unlike heroin or alcohol. This also explains why it slipped parental scrutiny.
The fact that parents of rich kids are too busy having a good time themselves, or are busy with work, has given today's young crowd more reason to party with Charlie. Cocaine addiction is a gradual, insidious process. It's not difficult for recreational use to become habitual abuse.
Moreover, since cocaine is not seen as a serious social issue yet, the Government has not given it any great priority. The Mahajan case may change that to some extent. Last week, Delhi Police called a meeting with owners of popular lounge bars who were given photographs of known drug dealers and were asked to shut down earlier than usual. They were also advised to train their staff in detecting drug use and to set up CCTVs in the bathrooms.
Delhi's snorting set has taken the hint and is lying low, but only till the dust settles and they can meet up again in the city's most fashionable addresses, pull out the packets of white powder and once again, literally, cross the line.

- J.J. Cale
Celebrities, rock stars, A-list clubs, parties, and a feel-good drug called cocaine. It's been a stimulating cocktail since the 1970s, when the so-called 'recreational' drug found favour with the smart set, encouraged by lyrical endorsements from rock legends like Eric Clapton who gave J.J. Cale's original a new lease of life-along with the intoxicant. It wasn't just rock stars.
In 1984, The New York Times ran an article, ""Cocaine: The Champagne of Drugs"", featuring three prominent users: Sigmund Freud, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Pope Leo XIII. Cocaine, unlike heroin, acquired the reputation of a chic, harmless drug for celebrities. Rolling Stone magazine called it ""America's star-spangled powder.""
India has been slow to snort. The white revolution saw a spike in popularity in the late 1990s but, as the Rahul Mahajan case reveals, it's now part of a blossoming but clandestine scene involving mainly the rich and the young, successful entrepreneurs, business scions and high-salaried professionals who start to 'do' cocaine as a fashion statement and then discover it's a euphoric way to de-stress and extend party hours.
Coke, as they call it, has replaced other drugs as the favoured social lubricant among affluent urban Indians who largely view it as a recreational, good-time high. ""Cocaine has become a determinant of surplus money,"" says Sanjay Chugh, psychiatrist and de-addiction expert.
Concurs Dr Yusuf Merchant, President of the Drug Abuse Information Rehabilitation and Research Centre in Mumbai: ""Cocaine is people's way of announcing 'We've arrived'. Earlier, a rocking party was Black Label and expensive wines. Today, a high society party will have cocaine. It immediately elevates your status on the party circuit.""
Cocaine and Party highs As pills, powder or packed in vials, these drugs are common in high society gigs COCAINE: a.k.a. coke, flake, Charlie and snow, is a crystalline alkaloid obtained from coco leaves. It resembles white powder and is usually divided into lines on a smooth surface and snorted using a rolled up currency note or a straw. It is a stimulant for the central nervous system. Cocaine is bad for anybody with high blood pressure or a heart condition. Price: Rs 3,000-5,000 for 1 gm. ECSTASY: A synthetic, psychoactive drug chemically similar to the stimulant methamphetamine and mescaline. It comes in the form of pills, although it can also be sold in powder form. Acts both as a stimulant and psychedelic, producing an energising effect, as well as distortions in time and perception. Some evidence suggests it can damage the brain. Price: Rs 600 per tablet. LSD: Commonly called acid, it is a semisynthetic psychedelic drug colloquially measured in 'hits' or 'tabs'. It causes expansion and alters experience of senses, emotions and awareness for eight to 14 hours. It may also produce strange visual effects. The drug sometimes spurs long-term or even permanent changes in a user's personality. Price: Rs 70 per tab. CRACK: A smokeable form of cocaine made into small lumps or rocks. It is a stimulant with short-lived effects. It's smoked in a pipe, glass tube or foil, known as freebasing. Regular users can become physically and psychologically dependent. Crack users can die of overdose. Risk increases if mixed with heroin, barbiturates or alcohol. Price: Rs 1,000 for 1 gram. HEROIN: A natural opiate made from the opium poppy. It comes as a white powder when pure. It can be smoked, snorted or dissolved in water and injected. Over time, the desired effects reduce so users have to take more to get the same effect. Long-term effects cause 'craving' and strong psychological and physical dependence. Excessive doses can lead to coma and even death from respiratory failure. Price: Rs 500 for 1 gram. SPEED: Amphetamine, often used as a substitute to cocaine. Boosts energy and suppresses appetite. Can keep user awake for up to 12 hours. Used a lot by students studying for exams or those who work long hours. Highly addictive with debilitating after-effects. Price: Rs 10 per tablet.
Sniffing and snorting from atop glass tables and bathroom tiles in the homes and farmhouses of the rich, young and almost-famous is a fairly recent phenomena. Till the mid-1990s, its use was restricted to the 30- and 40-somethings, also the rich and very Page 3, but primarily those who had had stints abroad or travelled to the West frequently.
Around a decade ago, say narcotics officials, there were about 1,000 users each in Delhi and Mumbai. It was a tight, restricted circle of-not rich, young brats looking for new ways to chill, but sophisticated, married couples aware of what they were doing and confident of their ability to handle themselves under its influence. No wild parties, orgies or frenzied snorting. Just a cool thing to do, discreetly.
The kind of A-list that 'did' cocaine was first revealed in 2001 with the arrest in Delhi of a prominent hotelier and party person for buying cocaine from Afghan drug peddler Naquibullah, a.k.a. Ali. Ali's interrogation revealed he was catering to 10 high-society groups in Delhi and Mumbai comprising the Page 3 swish set, including lawyers, industrialists, political scions, prominent fashion designers and Bollywood stars.
Today, that list reads vastly different. In cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, rich young kids dominate the scene, turning it into a psychedelic free-for-all where the dangers of prolonged cocaine use are ignored in favour of the status and extraordinary rush that cocaine brings to the table. As India's urban affluence spreads, so does the number of coke users.
According to data collected by Merchant's drug centre, the number of cocaine users has shot up by almost 300 to 400 per cent in the past four years. In Mumbai and Delhi, there are at least 50,000 people hooked to party drugs like cocaine.
A disturbing trend is the drop in the age of individuals experimenting with party drugs like coke to 16 and 17 year olds. After the first snort, it takes at least six to seven years for users to even realise they are addicted.
Another recent development is the increasing number of women doing party drugs to win acceptance on the party circuit. Cocaine use, say officials, has become especially rampant in the past two years.
Unfortunately for today's get-highquick young brigade, the dangers are lesser known than the effects: Bibek Maitra's death only underscores that. However, a majority of the young party crowd in cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore seem secure in the belief that since they use coke as an 'occasional drug' on weekends, it's perfectly safe. That's a dangerous misconception.
While coke is certainly less harmful than heroin or crack (see box), it's an insidious, socially-induced dependence. Most cocaine users are within the 25 to 34 age group, looking, like much else in their lives, for instant gratification. So long as it is used occasionally and within limits, cocaine is not a lethal drug. What makes it lethal is overuse, addiction and infusion with other intoxicants like heroin and excessive liquor. The risk is higher for first-time users with medical problems. Investigation into Maitra's death suggests that the cocaine he used had been mixed with heroin.
Ironically, the night Maitra and Mahajan were rushed to the Apollo Hospital, another party was in full swing in a south Delhi farmhouse. Mukesh Kapoor, son of a Bangalore industrialist, was celebrating his 32nd birthday with friends. At the party, one invitee confided to INDIA TODAY, the 'cake' was 30 gm of cocaine heaped on the centre-table. First, Mukesh rolled up a Rs 500 note and did two monster lines. His friends followed suit.
The resulting high is common to the concentric social circles of Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and Goa. Other cities like Chandigarh and Pune, besides affluent enclaves like Gurgaon and Noida, have also witnessed a spurt in cocaine use but it's not as alarming as in the three metros.

As in the West, there are certain industries in India where cocaine use is almost part of the job: fashion designing, advertising, public relations, the music industry, Bollywood (as the Fardeen Khan case revealed) and modelling.
For the high-fliers in these sectors, socialising into the wee hours is routine. And coke, inevitably, is de rigueur. In the past five years, young entrepreneurs and business scions have literally usurped the lead on the snorting circuit, indulging in it as a necessary social lubricant.
""There's nothing like a few lines of coke to lift you up on a Friday night,"" confesses Rahul K., 26, a Delhi-based interior designer. ""I work 13 hours a day and, after a tiring week, I need the rush to keep me going for the weekend. It gives me confidence in social situations.""
Many young people ""do coke"" under peer pressure: it's exceedingly difficult for a young man to not do what others are doing. (You can't fake by not inhaling the coke.) Principals of leading schools and colleges also point to a fair degree of cocaine use among students, especially those from international institutes run for British and American kids.
Unlike alcohol-induced intoxication, coke's popularity as a party drug has soared because it unleashes sensations that are exactly the opposite: superman energy, exhilaration, a sense of freedom and supremacy, and stress release.
Cocaine releases massive amounts of the hormone noradrenaline which in turn unlocks an instantaneous, amphetamine-like rush of confidence, elation and exhilaration. Animated and intense talking, fuelled by a surge of well-being and invincibility are common. The intensity, however, does not last long, requiring three or four lines of coke over an evening.
The reason why it's a drug for the affluent is because it's an expensive habit. Consider this. One gram of the Class A drug can make around 10 to 15 lines for snorting which can last two people anything from a couple of hours to an entire night-depending on their tolerance and the purity of the stuff. A reputed dealer will sell a gram of pure cocaine for around Rs 7,000, but the normal price for cocaine in India is between Rs 3,000 and 4,000 per gram.
EARLIER, A ROCKING PARTY WAS BLACK LABEL AND FANCY WINES. TODAY, THE HIP CROWD HAS FREE-FLOWING COKE.
Part of the reason cocaine is not seen as a debilitating drug in India is because it's not a home-grown product and partly because it is considered less harmful than other drugs like crack or heroin. Over 80 per cent of the world's cocaine comes from South America.
India, on the other hand, is emerging as a major transit point for drugs like heroin from the Golden Triangle (Myanmar, Laos and Thailand) and the Golden Crescent (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran). The international drug mafia brings cocaine into India from South America via Hong Kong and uses the same couriers or containers to smuggle out heroin to the US and Europe.
Last week, in what law-enforcement authorities claim is the biggest ever cocaine haul in India, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) seized 200 kg of the drug from a cargo vessel at Panvel port near Mumbai. The consignment, hidden in containers, was worth over Rs 90 crore in the local market. Officials say the consignment was lifted from Colombia, transported to Hong Kong and, finally, brought to Mumbai.
Narcotics officials say that in Delhi alone 1.5 to 2 kg of cocaine is sold every week. That's a lot of noses glued to the glass top. Cocaine use among the young, affluent sections of society is reaching endemic proportions, especially in Bangalore, where highsalaried techies are taking to it like, well, skiers take to another kind of white powder.
""What has perhaps led to this rise is the increasing glamorisation of drugs, accessibility, availability and pressure to stand out among the youth,"" says Dr Samir Parikh, head of the psychiatry wing of Max Healthcare, Delhi. The changing dynamics between parents and teenagers has also resulted in an air of leniency and a marked increase in the consumption of drugs.
DANGERS OF PROLONGED COCAINE USE ARE IGNORED IN FAVOUR OF THE STATUS AND EXTRAORDINARY RUSH IT GIVES.
For well-heeled 20-somethings, snorting coke has become as common as smoking pot was in the 1970s. ""People who take coke flaunt it because it's just so damn expensive,"" says Amit Nag, 24, who works for an MNC in Delhi.
Agrees Alok Sarin, psychiatrist at Sita Ram Bhartia Hospital in Delhi: ""This trend of 20-somethings trying coke is not surprising. What has changed over the years is the accessibility and availability of cocaine.""
One of the key reasons for the decline in the age group of first-time coke users is the vast amount of disposable income. A classic example is the BPO industry, where just-outof-college rookies, earning six figure salaries and working in a time warp, resort to drugs as a means to keep going through the night.
Delhi and Mumbai societies also have a somewhat laidback approach to cocaine. During the annual fashion week parties, there's an unending queue of models, designers and socialites filing into the bathroom to do a line of whites. According to narcotics sleuths, in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, the hippest clubs and restaurants are prime locations for buying cocaine. In September 2005, Dev Chopra, 27, was caught selling 15 gm of cocaine for Rs 65,000 to a couple outside one of Delhi's most popular restaurants, around the same time that Provogue owner Salil Chaturvedi was arrested in Mumbai for possessing two vials of cocaine.

However, most of the hip, young, affluent crowd still prefer the relative anonymity of their farmhouses where weekend parties rev up after rows of Charlie-as cocaine is locally referred to-are snorted in the bathrooms. The music, the coke, the vodka shots, the dance floor, all merge into one dazzling blur.
The energy and euphoria induced by cocaine ensures that the party winds up only when the sun peeps over the horizon. Raves present another popular coke-snorting scene, usually held at private residences, beaches or specific farmhouses.
There are two types of coke users. The recreational ones, young people from affluent classes, use it during weekend parties. They spend an average of Rs 50,000 per week on the drug or 1 gm per person. Some add ecstasy tabs to cocaine to heighten the effect and enhance sexual performance.
The second type of cocaine users are the addicts: they consume an average of 1 gm a day. The key area of concern involves addicts who refuse to accept that they are hooked and later face serious psychological and physical problems, not to mention financial troubles. For addicts with a-gram-a-day habit, the monthly expenditure would be well over Rs 1 lakh.
Cocaine popular among rich and young Cocaine popular among rich and young
For first timers, it's not that difficult to get hold of the cell number of a supplier; sometimes a cryptic password is passed on by an existing consumer. Once the new consumer calls the supplier and gives the password, he becomes part of the chain. This works as a reference system. The reference system works whether you are in Mumbai or Delhi. Either Maitra or Mahajan was aware of coke dealer Abdullah's cell number in Delhi.
The easy availability of cocaine in Delhi is best illustrated by 27-year-old Sanjeev Kashyap who told INDIA TODAY: ""I was at a party organised by a friend, a model by profession, three months ago. I saw cocaine in five different places, served like slices of cake. I sniffed it with a rolled-up note and after that it was as if I was dancing in heaven.""
Heaven actually happens almost every weekend at parties organised in various locations in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore. These parties, attended by the young, rich, hip crowd, have created a new subculture, almost a way of life. ""It is a matter of great concern that among the elite class, the consumption of cocaine has increased,"" says DGP, Narcotics, A.S. Cheema.
According to narcotics officials, in the National Capital Region, cocaine worth Rs 1 crore is sold every week. No exact statistics exist pertaining to cocaine usage. But if only 10 per cent of drug seizures is applied, the annual consumption of the drug in just Pune, Mumbai and Delhi is between 30 and 40 kg.
What gives cocaine its unique cachet is that, unlike other drugs, it has found favour with celebrities, authors and rock stars. Before Maitra, India never had a high-profile case of death due to cocaine use. The largest users of cocaine are males aged between 18 and 25 who write it off, mistakenly, as a high like alcohol, only better.
""There's something of a separate high in going to the loo with a friend and giving him a line of coke,"" says Sanjeev Suri, partner in a well-known architect firm. ""It's an act of bonding but it's also a bit naughty. No one in my crowd thinks of it as breaking the law. We're just having fun.""
Medical experts mostly differ on just how harmful the drug truly is. Despite its reputation, cocaine is neither irresistible nor inescapable. The occasional cocaine user need not become addicted if will-power and awareness are judicially used. It's the heavy, habitual use of cocaine that can cause problems. Excessive use can lead to paranoia, depression, social isolation, family disruption and problems at work.
What's helping it get out of hand is social peer pressure, a desire to belong to the 'right' crowd and enhance status, together with the kind of disposable income that today's young people have and, more crucially, the lack of parental supervision. ""Money is often used as a surrogate for affection,"" says Chugh. ""It is a buffering affect that 'good' parents think they are providing. Which is why when faced with a child with a substance abuse problem, the first reaction is denial.""

They were also advised to train their staff in detecting drug use and to set up CCTVs in the bathrooms.

The 45-year-old actor's medical report has put an end over the speculation on whether he was under influence on alcohol when the accident took place.
The accident took place near SAB TV Lane, Link Road at Andheri (W) around 5.30 am. Roy was on his way to Goregaon from Andheri when he lost control on the vehicle and rammed the Wagon R of the Darera family, who were on their way to Matheran. Roy admitted the injured to Kokilaben Ambani Hospital in Andheri (West) before been arrested by the Police from his Versova home.
""He was taken to Cooper Hospital for the medical check up. His blood samples were taken and no substance of alcohol was found,"" said an officer from Amboli Police Station requesting anonymity. Among the three injured Kantaben Darera, 53, is critical.
The other injured, Deepak Darera, 60, and Sneha Darera, 25, sustained major injuries. The fourth in the family, Pooja, 24, got minor injuries and was allowed to go home after primary treatment.
The officer said that Roy has been booked under section 279 (rash driving) and section 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of Indian Penal Code (IPC). If found guilty, he could be punished with imprisonment for two years or with fine, or with both.

They reportedly caught a judicial officer recently for drunken driving and tests revealed that the alcohol count in his body was twice the permissible limit.
Delhi Traffic Police joint commissioner Satyendra Garg. Delhi Traffic Police joint commissioner Satyendra Garg.
A senior traffic police officer requesting anonymity said the person, an additional chief judicial magistrate, was stopped in east Delhi during a routine check against drunken driving. He was issued a challan and the case referred to a court, which decides the quantum of punishment.
That was nearly two weeks ago.
On Sunday, Delhi Traffic Police joint commissioner Satyendra Garg brought the issue of high-profile traffic rule offenders into the public domain by posting a question on his department's popular Facebook page.
""During checking against drunken driving, one of the persons whose alchometer reading comes to 69 mg against the permissible 30mg claims that he is a judicial officer. What should traffic police officer do (sic)?"" Garg's poser to the public reads.
Within an hour of posting the question, the traffic police's Facebook page was flooded with reactions. By 9 pm there were more than 180 posts on the site which has over 80,000 followers.
Not surprisingly, the response from the public appears to be unanimous - law should be the same for everyone irrespective of his or her social or official status.
One of the responders, Kiran Babani wrote: ""Take him to the local police station and let him deal with the law like any other Indian citizen.""
Another zealous responder Kamal Pawar wrote: ""Challan him double the amount. Since he is a judicial officer he holds much responsibility. Set an example for every other officer as well (sic).""
Joint commissioner Garg has been known to use the department's Facebook page to reach out to the public on traffic issues.
But it was probably the first time that a public response was sought on the social networking site about the quantum of punishment for drunken driving by a high-profile person.
A traffic police officer, who refused to be named, defended Garg's decision to go public with the question.
""Drunken driving is a matter of public concern. He (Garg) has written a lot about this in the recent past. But as this case relates to a judicial officer, he might have thought it right to make the public aware about the traffic police's stand towards a government official,""the officer added.
Another officer said: ""What is wrong in this? A public platform is the best place to get opinions about what is right and what is wrong. Let the people decide.""
According to the law, the maximum punishment for such an offence is a stiff six months in jail or a fine of Rs 2,000 for first-time offenders and a two-year jail term with a fine of Rs 3,000 for the second offence.
A count of more than 30 mg on the alchometer constitutes drunken driving. A traffic police officer said a person driving a car could be jailed for consuming 30mg or more alcohol or more but usually a prison term is awarded only to those registering over 100mg.
Jail terms for drunken driving offenders were initiated in August 2010 after the traffic police took up the issue with the courts.
According to the Delhi Police statistics, over 12,900 people were caught driving under the influence of alcohol till September 20 this year, a figure which has already surpassed last year's figure of 11,388. While driving licences have been suspended in nearly 2,000 cases, 2,250 offenders were sent to jail to check the menace of drunken driving in the national Capital.
Considering the high number of cases of death due to drunken driving in the city, the department launched a multipronged strategy to control the nuisance. Apart from fines, jail terms were added through the courts to make the crackdown more effective.
It also invoked the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act and the provision of suspending driving licenses for the offence through courts.
The crackdown has been intensified from a routine check once a week to at least twice a week random checks across the city."

The air was thick with sweet smelling smoke and the rave party was peaking at 2.30 a.m. last Sunday, when a bunch of 25 policemen in their psychedelic party-gear drifted into Donje village farmhouse, 30 km from Pune. Accompanying the Pune Rural Police was a team of media persons who had travelled from the city to catch the action ""live"". After some mingling and dancing with the unsuspecting and intoxicated youth for about 15 minutes, the police nabbed the drug-peddlers and revellers for ""vulgar dancing"".For the uninitiated, a rave party is an all-night dance event where disc jockeys (DJ) play trance music throughout. What started as the most awaited Holi bash turned into a nightmare for many young professionals and students. Interestingly, this is not the only rave party to be organised with drugs and alcohol. Like all others, the invites for this party too were sent through SMS and posts on the Internet. Mumbai's Madh Island and Goa are known destinations for such raves, although the Pune Rural Police identified Donje village farmhouse as their target. Says Assistant Police Inspector (Pune Rural Police) Rajendra Galande, ""The youngsters were dancing in an obscene manner."" However, reporters contend that they were only dancing like they do in discotheques.Approximately 280 people aged between 20 and 35 years were arrested under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. While 150 people arrested earlier have been granted bail by the local court, others like Paramjit Singh Brar and Dhruv Kaushal (alleged drug peddlers), Ramdas Aghawane (owner of the farmhouse), Sharad Shankar and Shivendru Gupta (businessmen from Chennai), Stephen Mullar (German DJ) and Christopher (alleged German peddler) have been remanded to police custody till March 9. ""The others arrested include air hostesses, IT professionals, call centre employees and students from Mumbai, Pune, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Haryana,"" says Vishwas Nangre-Patil, superintendent of police (Pune Rural). Investigations have revealed the name of an Irish woman Shania. who is a well-known international drug-peddler. behind the Pune rave party. The police have arrested two other drug dealers, Asif and Rafiq, from Pune, who were caught in other rave parties earlier.While there's no denying that the police did seize 2.5 kg ganja and charas and seven bottles of phenyn fine hydrochloride (California drop), they have no explanation as to why they chose this party over others which have been held in Pune, Mumbai and Goa. MTV video jockey (VJ) Nikhil Chinappa feels the event was targeted at getting publicity and said, ""Why should this particular event be singled out and how come journalists were present?""According to the website that advertised the rave in Pune, two other parties were being held in Delhi and Bangalore at the same time. Although the police refute the incidence of rave parties all through the year, ravers say that such parties take place at least twice a month in the outskirts of Mumbai and Pune. Ironically whenever such raids happen, it is mostly the drug consumers who are booked and not the peddlers. Says Patrick Gomes, who has attended several parties around the Madh beach area of Mumbai, ""I go to the raves for music. Although there are some people who do drugs, others only consume alcohol. There is nothing wrong with that.""The point made in this entire episode is how drug abuse has filtered down from the who's who of the society to youngsters who have more money at their disposal today. ""These parties target educated youngsters who earn Rs 25,000 per month,"" says DCP Dilip Srirao, Anti Narcotics Cell (ANC), Mumbai Police.Meanwhile, parents of those accused said the police were merely trying to earn accolades. ""They invited the media and assuming that everyone had consumed drugs, arrested all."" This is not the first time such raids have been conducted. The ANC earlier arrested 86 people following a raid in Gorai in September 2006 but that was only after their medical reports confirmed that they had consumed drugs. This time, however, the Pune Rural Police arrested 280 people without waiting for their medical reports to confirm their crime.While the police are speculating the possible involvement of the Israeli drug mafia among others, sources say organising a rave is simple and costs between Rs 10 and Rs 15 lakh. An event management company in Mumbai says, ""It's a simple modus operandi for which the most important criterion is a venue. Rave organisers sell anything between Rs 10,000 and Rs 60,000 per night for the venue. The second step is to organise a DJ and arrange for alcohol."" However, the interesting bit comes in when the company on condition of anonymity admits, ""For a party of 300 people, we organise 2 kg of ganja, half kg of hashish, half litre of LSD drops and at least 600 Ecstasy tablets from regular peddlers. Organisers have a fixed clientele that is informed by word of mouth. The organiser earns his due by charging an entry fee (between Rs 500 and Rs 2,000) and a premium on the drugs.""The police say they have kept a close watch on discotheques. ""There are parties that serve drugs. We have created a network of informers to get information on such raves,"" says Srirao. Meanwhile, even as the police try to strengthen their network, raves are being held regularly. If not Mumbai or Pune, ravers find parties happening near other metros. Goa has the biggest rave parties during Christmas and New Year for which all one needs is to log on to a few websites to be in the loop. With little check on the narcotics trade in the country and a few stray raids, drug abuse at rave parties is bound to continue."
153,The new white flesh trade,[],2011-01-25 17:17:12,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"Lola, 22, is a tall girl with high, thin eyebrows on a slender face. Her features are sharp but her eyes are uninterested, fixed at a painting on the wall of the coffee shop, as she tries hard to explain, in broken English, why she is in India. Clad in a too-tight pink sweatshirt, faded cream shorts and shiny red boots, her right hand bearing a cocktail ring which she keeps twisting nervously, her blue nail varnish chipped, she seems a far cry from her alluring nocturnal avatar as one of the Capital's high-priced prostitutes.
She speaks of how she came to work here two-and-a-half months ago. Her boyfriend TC, not Tom Cruise, she clarifies, momentarily showing signs of life, joined her last month. Both are clear about what they want from their lives--enough money to buy a house in Tashkent, their hometown in Uzbekistan.

The websites guarantee confidentiality.
One of five siblings who grew up in poverty, Lola's mother is dead and her father was abusive. For her it's just another job. There are no regrets. ""It was TC who did all the running around for me, got my papers done and put me on a flight to Delhi,"" she says.
Lola is not alone. She is part of a growing army of fair-skinned prostitutes, about 3,000 of them in the Capital and about the same number in the other parts of the country. They are from Ukraine, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Chechnya and Kyrgyzstan, all of which are part of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
Replacing the earlier favourites, imports from Nepal, and charging 40 per cent more than Indian prostitutes, they are changing the rules of the game, feeding on the Indian fascination for white skin and the greater openness with which they can promote their sexual favours, through classified advertisements in newspapers and professionally-designed websites.
That the fascination for white skin is transnational is evident from the string of recent arrests. Last year, on December 10, a Delhi-based hotel manager, Shanker Mishra, was arrested in Rajkot along with an Uzbek prostitute in her late 20s, Ragini, a native of Tashkent. Initial investigations revealed that Mishra would provide women to cash-rich traders and garment exporters in Rajkot, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Indore.
A little earlier, on October 30, another sex racket was busted in Mahipalpur, Delhi, where three women of CIS origin, Aslefya, 23, Sonya, 25, and Roma, 27, were arrested following a scuffle between a few pimps and locals in front of a guesthouse, 365 Inn.
In July, the Crime Branch of the Delhi Police arrested two CIS prostitutes when a decoy customer was sent to strike a deal with them. The pimp, Goldy, came with the two foreign women in a car. They were here on a six-month tourist visa and had been in the Gulf before coming to India; with their stay here governed by a Rs 1.5 lakh contract for each girl for one month. The women will be deported soon.
Two of the three prostitutes arrested in the Capital in October last year. Two of the three prostitutes arrested in the Capital in October last year.
But it's quite likely they will be back, admits Joint Commissioner of Police, Crime, Mumbai, Rakesh Maria. ""The prostitution racket involving CIS women is very well organised. The Indian pimps are in close touch with their counterparts in Dubai and CIS countries,"" he says. It's the culmination of events that began with the collapse of the Soviet Union and gained momentum with the entry of young CIS women into Dubai, transforming it into a major centre of prostitution.
According to an article in The New Yorker in 2008, an ""almost perfect recipe: mass immigration, mass transience, a tremendous concentration of money and anonymity, and a robust demand for labour"". But a crackdown in Dubai in December 2007 when 240 people were arrested and in May last year when 2,713 prostitutes were detained as well as the deportation of 228 Uzbek women from Thailand recently, ensured that many women moved south, a process hastened by the meltdown.
Inside the new trade Getting a light-skinned prostitute is rather easy. All one has to do is call one of the numbers flashed in the two dozen-odd difficult-to-ignore massage advertisements in the classified pages of leading dailies. The sales pitch starts as soon as the ad is mentioned. Then there's the Net, where a search for 'escort service' with the city name yields pages of results. Most of the women come as tourists from the impoverished republics of the former Soviet Union, particularly Uzbekistan. Some are coerced while others get into this business voluntarily. The so-called 'aunties', CIS women who have been illegally living in India for several years, act as the interface between the women and local pimps. The aunties are local agents of a mafia back home and share up to 50 per cent of the profits. Most prostitutes are not paid; they serve 'aunties' under informal contracts that pay off loans taken back home by their families in return for services provided here. The contracts run for three to six months, during which up to a third of a prostitute's earnings go repay family loans. Lured by big money, some women come back as 'freelancers'. They then stay with an Indian pimp, who sometimes helps them get a visa. They also pay these women a daily fee which is usually between Rs 10,000 and Rs 15,000. Most women reinvest their earnings to make a profit; exporting leather garments is a favoured avenue. The pimps also make money by organising rooms for clients. Five-star hotels, farmhouses and guesthouses are hotspots, with smaller establishments bending rules to ensure anonymity. Official addresses are avoided. Some women aren't prostitutes and others aren't just that. As part of dancing troupes, they are called 'belly dancers' or 'item girls' and serve as hostesses and showgirls at parties. Lax visa rules make for a thriving sex trade. Joint Commissioner of Police,Crime,Mumbai, Rakesh Maria says, ""The pimps in India, Dubai and CIS countries work in close coordination."" A secret report of the NSA had expressed concern over foreigners buying land illegally. Others have established guesthouses and restaurants. Only half a dozen arrests were made last year; there were no convictions. According to the law, soliciting or encouraging the exchange of sexual services for money is a sex crime and not prostitution. Sometimes these women are deported, but most of them come back. The Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls (Amendment) Act, 1978, is toothless. Most arrested women get bail as soliciting is difficult to prove. This prompted the Supreme Court last month to ask the government to legalise prostitution, on a PIL filed by an NGO called the Bachpan Bachao Andolan.
""The odds were against staying in Dubai,"" says Nagina, a 27-year-old Muslim from Samarkand who was in Dubai till a month ago. She escaped the police but many of her friends are in jail for illegally entering the country on false passports. She doesn't like to go to a bar to meet a client as ""it is against my religion"". But prostitution? ""They need our services and we provide it,"" she says. Or take Roma, a 25-year-old from Karshi, Uzbekistan, who ran away from a violent father when she was 17. She was sucked into prostitution and sent to Dubai where her travel documents were confiscated. She is now a veteran with seven years of experience and this is her third stay in India. She lives in a three-storey flat in Delhi, atop a spiral staircase. It's a big living room with bare orange walls, a dressing table with lights and a smorgasbord of cosmetics. As she settles down in a couch to talk, the only sign of her profession is a roommate who lies huddled in the bedroom next door, sleeping in mid-afternoon, working off the effects of a late night. As she flicks the ash from her cigarette, Roma says, ""Only the best survive. The pressure to do well is so high. I learned English and have been to the US and Europe. I am okay with this life.""
As the hunting ground shifts from Dubai, the CIS women, often referred to as ""night butterflies"", find India easier to work in. The classified advertisements in newspapers are easy to spot, printed by the dozens every day, five lines each costing Rs 1,800, giving mobile numbers, the option of paying by credit card and dropping cryptic hints of ""body massage"" assuring ""full satisfaction"". Translate what that means: accompanying clients on long drives, having sex with them during the lunch hour in pimp hideouts around commercial hubs or in designated safehouses, and playing host at 'stag' parties where they serve alcohol and food skimpily dressed. All this for prices ranging from Rs 8,000 to Rs 30,000 depending on the duration.
It's difficult to miss them, whether it is five-star hotel lobbies, elite clubs or farmhouses. They come here on tourist visas for three to six months and stay with 'aunties', women from CIS countries, who act as mediators between agents in home countries and pimps in India. The women are paid on a daily basis.
In Delhi, for example, over 150 Indian pimps host them and some of them have four to five CIS women on their payroll. The pimps pocket the money from clients, as payment for their upkeep as well as promotion. Call at any of the numbers advertised in the newspapers and they are quite blunt. ""She will do all you want,"" says the male voice at the other end. ""Trained handling"" means the client will relive his ""wildest fantasies"". And when they say ""full satisfaction guaranteed"", they mean ""the girl will do whatever the clients wants, in the way they want, with great ability"". Some even promise to refresh clients with world class 'blwoiob' (blowjob) 'ser'(vice), the misspelling deliberate to avoid trouble.
Some get poetic, luring clients with phrases such as ""indulge yourself in the most electrifying experience of your lifetime with our bewitching masseuses"" or proclaiming that carnal pleasures can be sublime, ""where mind and soul entwine together in heights of pleasure"". So says a classified ad aimed at older customers. The idea is all are welcome, from the cash-rich entrepreneur to the high performing salesman, who gets sex as a bonus.
There is an even easier option, the Internet. Google 'escort service' and the name of the city where you intend to access the services, and voila, the choices pop up faster than Roger Federer's serves. Professionally designed websites offer a host of services and a detailed rate list. Again, all it requires is a call to the given number, the time of requirement, and the specific service.
""Whether for pleasure trips, business occasions, corporate events, functions or dinner dates"", ""especially handpicked to provide the highest level of service possible with professionalism, integrity and discretion assured at all times for the discerning gentlemen,"" declares one website. Clients can book their services from anywhere in the world, can even outsource the planning of a fun-filled holiday to them. Payment is to be made in advance and clients are given the convenient option of paying by credit card.
A pimp strikes a deal in a shady corner. A pimp strikes a deal in a shady corner.
Declares one website, ""For gentlemen who would want to move beyond the confines of the hourly session, I offer these exclusive getaway packages,"" to the scenic towns of Nainital and Shimla in summers and to regal Jaipur and Agra in winters. Yet another tells its prospective customers, ""My favourite pastime in the field of the adult industry, always has been related to couples, including lesbian or bisexual female couples and groups of people.""
Their skin colour is their biggest selling point. ""Sex with light-skinned women is aspirational,"" says Pramada Menon, a Delhi-based gender activist. The CIS women agree. ""Indians are so conscious of their colour and ours,"" says Sarah, 27, from Tashkent, who has been here now for five months on a tourist visa. So much so that Indian women find it difficult to counter the 'white cult' that is taking over the premium flesh trade. Indian women have to be hard-sold. So if it's an Indian woman, the advertisement reads: she is a 'Punjabi' (read intense and fair), 'model' (slim and beautiful), 'airhostess' (suave and smart), 'hygienic' (clean), 'broadminded' and 'sober'. Broadminded assures clients that the women will play out their fantasies, while 'sober' indicates that they will be professional about it.
""East European girls have a different look and they are exotic for Indians as much as Delhi girls are unusual for Americans,"" that's a recorded voice playing on Vivek's phone--he operates in an upmartket neighbourhood of the Capital and has four CIS women on his roster. ""Most of our clients have gained money recently and want new girls every time,"" he adds.
CIS women also offer anonymity. ""For our older, wealthier and regular customers, it is not about sex but courtship,"" says Feruza, 32, an Uzbek woman. ""They want somebody to give them an honest hearing and like the way we pamper them. Language is an issue but we can talk them into relaxation. They like that they are in command and that actually helps them surrender to us,"" she says. Ask Nitin, who runs a computer hardware business at a commercial complex in Delhi. He is in his mid-30s and is married with children. For him, the once-a-week sexcapade is an addiction he cannot do without.
""These women have an element of professional detachment. They are here for a few months and you don't know whether you will ever see them again. They are not interested in you beyond the task well done,"" he says, comparing them with their Indian counterparts. ""But the Indians want your number. They give theirs, want to know what I do and how much I earn. Then they go on about how they belong to a good family too but have been forced into prostitution by some compelling circumstances. That is so irritating.""
Shrugs Shruti, a 19-year-old college girl who doubles as a call girl and is on the roster of two pimps in Delhi, ""If Indian men are looking for white women for their novelty, white men are interested in us. They give us generous tips."" But why do white women attract so many repeat customers? ""We cannot do things that white women do with Indian men,"" says Shruti huffily.
CIS women dress well, wear immaculate make-up and carry the best accessories. They also play nice enough to have some men in their thrall. Roma gives the example of a 35-year-old married businessman, who offered to marry her. When she refused, he would insist only on her, paying extra for her services. ""Aunty wanted me to meet him more often as money was coming thick and fast, but I stopped because he was getting emotional about the whole affair,"" she says, adding on second thoughts, ""but it is not a bad idea to get married after all.""
The 'aunties' are the key to the business. Usually heavily-built, manicured, made-up, chain-smokers, they pronounce their verdict with the authority borne of years of handling pimps, visa agents and police officials. ""I tell my girls to come back if the clients get rough. They can call me any time even when they are with the clients. If they don't like something, they can stop right there,"" says one aunty. Four of them have formidable reputations. They have their areas of domination but their areas of operation overlap.

With names like Svetlana, Diana, Nafisa and Sweta, these aunties have never been prostitutes themselves but are cashing in on their strong Indian connections. The fathers of two aunties were diplomats stationed in India 20 years ago; another has a KGB background. For them, it's not a racket but a business. Says an aunty, dressed in a long black skirt, a thick bead necklace nestling in the V of a cleavage-popping white T-shirt, ""More then 20,000 girls have come and gone from India in several lots over the past two years. Most were from CIS countries and have done well for themselves."" The numbers are lower than in the UAE and Dubai, she adds.
These aunties are careful and so are the women. Unlike their Indian counterparts, they always carry a pack of flavoured condoms. Cleanliness is an issue and they insist that clients take a shower before going to bed with them. They have a dress code for bed too: red and black lingerie from the best brands. Sometimes the aunties insist on sending Indian prostitutes first. Only when she gives an all-clear signal is the client allowed to sleep with a white woman.
In order not to attract undue attention, only two girls are lodged in one flat each in areas close to busy neighbourhoods. They wear Fabindia clothes by day, have a fetish for leather garments at night and sport dark eyeliner at all times. ""That's our fashion statement,"" says Bessica, 27. The mother of two has been in India for four months after her jobless husband persuaded her to come here. ""I was in the UAE and Dubai before I came to India. The girls of my generation do feel the pangs. We are spiritually dead,"" she says.
Most of the women come directly to aunties to pay off loans their family took back home. ""It is according to an informal contract between the family and the agent back home where the girls are required to stay overseas for three to six months to pay off their debt by making themselves available for prostitution,"" says Mashhura, 28, who belongs to Buxoro in Uzbekistan. Some come back to make money for themselves and get in touch with Indian pimps like Vivek who maintains four such 'freelancers' and pays each Rs 10,000 per day for their period of stay. They sometimes end up working 12 hours a day, meeting six different clients, as pimps make Rs 35,000 a day, which includes the police cut, their stay and other expenses.
Rajiv, 30, a pimp in Delhi, has six such women in his list. He calls prospective clients to his home and gives them one of his rooms. His wife, a tall woman in a salwar-kameez, who listens to him negotiating from behind the curtain of the living room and often walks out to tell the client sternly, ""the price is fixed.""
The number of CIS-origin prostitutes in India is growing. Four hundred prostitutes are expected to arrive in the Capital during the Commonwealth Games to be held later in the year. ""We know there will be great demand for women then and special arrangements are being made, like renting safehouses. Some Indian pimps are even buying flats,"" says Avita, 30, who came here with her cousin from Tashkent.
Insiders also say that some girls are brought to India as part of dance troupes. These women perform group dances in revealing clothes, mostly at private parties. According to Rishikant, a 32-year-old activist who works for the NGO, Shakti Vahini, and has rescued more than 1,000 girls in the last decade from prostitution, ""Their number has increased significantly in the last one-and-a-half years."" He explains that the police are aware of the problem but can do little as senior officers are involved.
India's anti-trafficking law, the Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls (Amendment) Act (SITA), 1978, aims at combating the commercialisation of the flesh trade (brothels, prostitution rings and pimping). Prostitution is not illegal. But in practice, SITA is not commonly used; instead the Indian Penal Code is deployed to charge sex workers with crimes such as public indecency or public nuisance, punishable with imprisonment up to six months or fine or both. If the sex worker is a minor, the client may get a sentence of seven to 10 years. But, given the overt manner in which the flesh trade operates, it cannot happen without the support of the police. Former police officer Kiran Bedi calls it the ""collective failure of the whole criminal judicial system.""
Failure or not, the women don't mind. ""We get to travel, stay in new places and make friends. Yes, the money is good. But I like it here as well,"" says Kate, 27, who was presented as a model to an exporter in Delhi with whom she would be travelling to Goa. She arrived in India about a month-and-a-half ago and has already been with 50 men. As she leaves, dressed in tight jeans and a brown psychedelic top under a black leather jacket, a white taxi waiting outside to take her to her 51st client, she shrugs her shoulders.
""I was deported from Israel last year. The next few days will be tricky. It's Republic Day and security is tight.'' It's one of the perils of her profession. But one she carries off as easily as the Christian Louboutin high heels she bought online last year. It's price she extracts for the pleasure she provides."
154,Whisky ban leaves guests high & dry,[],2010-10-09 13:29:51,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"The presiding deities of the Commonwealth Games Village seem to believe in an axiom that used to be often repeated in old Hindi films: whisky is risky.
It shows in the choice of alcoholic beverages - just beer and wine - that is as uninspiring as the dcor of the only bar that serves the 6,600 residents of the Village from one inconspicuous corner of the International Zone.
The choice hasn't gone down well with delegates and coaches, who can afford to imbibe, unlike the athletes they lead. A South African delegate echoed the prevailing sentiment when he said on the condition of anonymity, "" I have been to various countries and all of them run full bars.
Athletes are responsible enough to stay away from alcohol before their events and the officials must have the freedom to drink what they like.
Delegates recalled with nostalgia the well-stocked bars operating at different venues at the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games and the 2008 Beijing Olympics. One of them said the Games Village in Beijing had a liquor store in addition to a wellprovisioned bar.
Why, they wondered, were they being denied this little pleasure at the Games Village in Delhi? The bar offerings are limited to Sula and Nine Hills wines (Rs 900 per bottle and Rs 200 per glass) to pints of Kingfisher (Rs 100) and Corona (Rs 200). No self- respecting bar can get away with this limited menu.
Village mayor Dalbir Singh is unfazed by such criticism. ""No one has come up to me and said he wanted to have 'hard alcohol',"" Singh said, adding in his defence: ""Most countries serve beef at such events but it's not on our menu. It's just a country thing.""
He went on to say that ""foreigners don't like drinking whisky"" - a view not shared by the delegates this correspondent spoke to. ""The officials who wish to drink can go to the various restaurants in the city,"" Singh suggested. But the delegates aren't amused."

Vitamin B helps the brain
American researchers have found that vitamin B3, or niacin, a common water- soluble vitamin, can "" rewire"" the brain by improving blood vessels in patients. Rats with ischemic stroke given niacin "" sprouted"" nerve cells, which greatly improved their neurological functions. Scientists said this finding could result in the development of a new low cost treatment for stroke patients. The results of this study may also open doors in other areas of neurological medicine, including brain injury. Past studies into B vitamins have indicated that they can help to prevent heart attacks and strokes.
How much is too much, and when does any habit become ""excessive"", be this eating, drinking, shopping or sex? The answer, say therapists, lies in whether this behaviour damages your life in any way. It was Clinton who first offered us a glimpse of how sex can ruin a person's life. More recently, Tiger Woods's string of sexual escapades has confirmed this idea that 'out of control' sexual behaviour which seems addictive can have far-reaching consequences.Sex addiction is being recognised as a problem the world over but in the Indian context, very little research has been done on this problem and its treatment. Experts say that this is because sex is still a taboo subject in our culture. ""Ours is a predominantly patriarchal society in which a sexual problem or addiction is considered an affront to masculinity so a man suffering from sex addiction is simply hailed as 'virile',"" says Dr Rachna Singh, consultant psychologist, Artemis Health Institute.Undoubtedly sex addiction has to be defined carefully as a person might have a high libido, nothing more, and his sexual needs might not match his partners, which leads to him being branded unfairly as an addict. ""There are no clear cut lines to define what too much sex is. If a man with a high libido finds a match in his partner then there is no problem. But when the desire to have sex takes over a person's life and renders it dysfunctional, then the psychological and physical condition should be analysed,"" says Dr Wadia.While the idea that anyone can be addicted to sex is still scoffed at, using this as a 'medical' excuse for promiscuous behavior makes the matter more controversial. Especially since this is not even recognised as a disorder by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), considered the psychiatrist's Bible and ""hypersexual disorder"" is under consideration for the next edition.Woods recently offered a public apology for his infidelity, saying he was returning to his religious faith and admitting that he had ""work to do."" This declaration appeared to be in the line of the steps advocated by a de-addiction programme called the 12-step approach. This universally-accepted plan was first formulated by Alcoholics Anonymous and has since then been adopted by Narcotics Anonymous, Sex Addicts Anonymous and groups for gambling, food and shopping addictions. Alcoholics Anonymous is the largest of all the twelve-step programs, followed by Narcotics Anonymous.Woods's apology last week to his family and his wife's family, his business partners and sponsors, and parents who ""used to point to me as a role model for their kids,"" seemed to be in line with steps 8 and 9 of the programme, which advocate listing everyone harmed and the making of amends.The 12-step is intended to provide psychological, social and spiritual support for addicts. Crucial to this is the admission that their addiction isn't in their control and that there is a greater power that can give strength. Past mistakes are rectified with the help of a sponsor who is an experienced member. The final step is to learn to live a new life with a new code of behaviour and help others who suffer from the same addictions or compulsions. ""We use many of the principles of the 12-step in our counselling ,"" declares Elizabeth Selhore, director of Sahara, an NGO that runs a rehabilitation programme for drug and alcohol addiction. Selhore admits that while sex addiction is not "" acknowledged"" in India, it is a problem nonetheless. ""Anything can become an addiction, including love and sex.""Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and counselling are typically used to deal with addictive behaviour. According to Dr Samir Malhotra, HOD psychiatry at Fortis Noida, people with addictions avoid seeking professional help. ""Groups like AA are not very active. But many elements of the 12-step programme are a part of recovery programmes, even though people may not follow the exact 12 steps. Systems of recovery vary and the patient's personality and circumstances as well as environment needs to be evaluated especially where sex addiction is concerned,"" says Malhotra.The pros and cons of the 12-step are debatable. One of the biggest advantages is the sense of community and belonging that it offers those struggling with addiction. It destigmatises addiction and helps a person accept responsibility for their dependence on drugs, alcohol or sex. Following the plan costs nothing and a person can count on it.One of the arguments against the programme is that it focuses on the emotional and spiritual, and neglects the physical. ""But that's why it's important to create your own plan based on some of the principles only,"" counters Selhore. Sahara's plan includes vigorous physical activity and the NGO has its own football team which competes in country level tournaments.Calling yourself an addict is essential in the 12-step plan. This admission is hard for some, as is the social involvement that is part of the plan. Many people struggling with addiction find this hard to deal with as it makes them uncomfortable or nervous. The public confessional approach is another area of the programme that may make people cringe. Some feel that the need for belief in a Higher Power which is integral for those following the plan also comes in the way of its universal applicability and efficacy. Selhore doesn't agree though. ""The programme talks of God or a Higher Power but doesn't give any name to this power, so it's applicable to everyone and it doesn't matter whether you are a Christian or Hindu."""
156,Naomi feared she wouldn't survive as a model,[],2010-05-28 13:17:39,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"Supermodel Naomi Campbell used to think she ""wouldn't survive"" the modelling world and used to hate looking at herself in the mirror.
The 40-year-old runway beauty admitted she pushed herself too hard because she thought she would go ""crazy"" if she had to sit down and evaluate what she wanted out of life, reported Femalefirst online.
""To be honest, there were times I thought I wouldn't survive. The time between 1998 and 2005 was especially bad.
During that time I avoided looking in the mirror, because I didn't like the person who was looking back at me,"" said Campbell.
""So I had to find out what I wanted and what I didn't want. The thing is, as a model you're used to being on the go, so just the thought of sitting down and thinking about something drives you crazy,"" she added.
The mental pressure led the British model to consume more alcohol.
""I used to have a lot of problems. Amongst others I drank too much so I joined the Alcoholics Anonymous to get and stay sober,"" said Campbell."
157,The skywriter,[],2010-01-15 15:49:50,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"More than a decade ago, when I first visited the Nehru Planetarium, I never knew what surprises awaited me. I was a student of literature with no interest in astrophysics whatsoever. I was accompanying a friend who was a member of AAAD. I had heard lots of interesting stories about this club (which sounded more like Alcoholics Anonymous), but actually stood for Amateur Astronomers Association of Delhi.
My first impression of the planetarium was that it was a dark and dim place with lots of space-related objects that made little sense to me at the time. But the moment I entered the Night Sky Theatre, I was hooked. It has a simulated night sky where amateur astronomers learn to navigate their way across the stars, constellations and other heavenly bodies. I was amazed to know that not only do the constellations have names, but all 88 of them have names for each of the star that forms them as well.
Another thing that truly interested me as a literature student was that most of the northern constellations were named after Greek gods like Aries, legendary heroes such as Hercules, mythical creatures like Cetus, Centaurus and Hydra, and even the mythological river of Eridanus!
Who would have thought that I would see an amalgamation of literature and ancient mythology in the so-called 'den of science'.
It as then that I realised that astronomy is different things to different people. Maybe that is the reason why AAAD housed members from six to 60 years old. It nurtured people's imaginations and inspired them to look at the heavens and beyond.
For school students, who usually come during the vacations, it is a place to make that special science project that will give them an edge over others. For college students, it is a stepping stone to know more about astrophysics and astronomy-a field that is unfortunately not covered in the undergraduate level in any Indian university.
Even when I accompanied our group for overnight observations in the hinterland, I noticed that everyone saw the stars from their individual perspective. A student of chemistry sees nuclear reactions. A physicist may be more interested in the electromagnetic effect that celestial objects will have. A farmer sees the night sky as a calendar that helps him decide when to sow and reap his harvest. A navigator sees the night sky as a guide pointing to new places. A poet sees the beauty of the night sky as an inspiration. To the common man, with an interest in myths, the night sky reflects the different stories heard during childhood.
This was one of the many reasons why I chose to be faithful to astronomy-it is a truly democratic science. In short, astronomy has a very big heart, perhaps as big as the universe it tries to explore.

That, however, did not deter this only son from taking to drugs. It took just a scolding from his mother about ""not being serious"" about his career to cross over to where his friends had already arrived by then. The family had land and money, so college life was all about friends, parties, girls and drinking binges.

Moving on to smack was then only incidental. What was initially achievable for Rs 100 soon needed Rs 600 and a full gram of the contraband. ""Initially I could manage it from home. Then I began to borrow, beg and steal. Soon I was in debt,"" says Manmeet. One day he fraudulently got his mother""s signature on a deed and sold his house worth over Rs 30 lakh for merely Rs 16 lakh. All this while Manmeet had to never bother about the availability of the drug. ""It""s available in every street,"" he says.

His tryst with smack began in Chandigarh where he went for a job with a call centre. ""I had rented a flat where friends would hang out and some of them were on smack. They would coax me to have a sniff and I couldn""t offend them for long."" Kanwar would often doze off at work, before he was fired. He went back to Bathinda, and drugs.

Drugs have taken over Punjab. Sixty-seven per cent of the rural households have at least one drug addict. Three out of 10 girls have abused one or the other drug. Of school-goers, 66 per cent chew gutka or tobacco. Seven out of 10 college-going students abuse some drug.
The frightening figures feature in a recent affidavit filed by the Punjab Government in the Punjab and Haryana High Court. ""We are in danger of losing the young generation,"" says Harjit Singh, secretary, Department of Social Security and Women and Child Development. It has set alarm bells ringing.
The scene is particularly bad in rural Punjab. Cut to a village in Moga. At over 40 degrees, it""s unbearably hot and humid. In a corner of a huge courtyard, Varinder Singh, 26, lies on a cot, almost unconscious, his face all sweaty yet covered with a bedsheet. It takes a lot of effort for his family to even wake him up.
""My body""s been aching since last night,"" he says. But a family member says this is routine since he started taking morphine injections. They sent him to a few deaddiction centres, but without any success. All was well till he passed Class XII, when he suddenly became convinced that there were no jobs, so studies were a waste. The family thought marriage might help but that too broke off after a couple of years.
Such sights and stories are common. Kin mostly just give up, after trying initially. In fact, in many cases, families get to know a little too late. ""Unlike in the past, most of them don""t do any physical labour. Then there is no source of entertainment. So they fall on narcotics and synthetic drugs,"" says IPS officer Praveen Sinha, who worked with the Special Narcotics Cell, Amritsar.
Inspector General of Police R.P. Meena, who also heads the recently-constituted Anti-Narcotics Task Force in the state, says, ""One big factor is unemployment. They have nothing to do. So they take to drugs. Peddlers see huge profits, and because there is demand, there is supply. Crime rates against both property and persons have gone up and it is also leading to more cases of hepatitis and HIV.""

Recently the National AIDS Control Organisation revealed that Amritsar has the highest number of HIV-positive drug users in India. The national average is about 7.23 per cent, while in Amritsar it is 30.4 per cent. The situation in the rest of Punjab is no better. ""The problem stems from affordability, availability and peer pressure. It is generally up to families to take care. But when fathers and elder brothers are already into it, who will stop the younger ones? Also, rural sports are dying,"" says Sherry Sabbarwal, professor of sociology, Panjab University.
The deteriorating record of candidates, particularly from rural Punjab, in police and army recruitment speaks clearly of falling fitness standards. When drugs run in your veins, you are good for nothing. Patiala""s Bir Devinder Singh, 31, has represented the country in junior boxing and recalls the days when his punch was feared. He had an accident and became too restive, thinking that he would never regain his fitness. And ""caring"" friends ensured that he never got fit again by offering him ""sulpha"" first and smack later.
Alcohol, opium and poppy have been a tradition but now the addicts have moved on. According to the affidavit, ""Opiates, their derivatives and synthetic opiate drugs are the most preferred ones followed by combinations of opiate and sedatives""poppy husk, smack, heroin, charas, ganja"" and synthetic drugs""such as brufen, proxyvon, diazepam, combiflam, calmpose, morphine injection and syrups""which are easily available.""
But how do the dangerous drugs land here? An official says, ""The Iran-Iraq war led to stringent checking by European nations and the US for illicit narcotics filtering from Afghanistan and Pakistan. Drug traffickers thus changed the route to via India, of which 40 per cent passes through Punjab."" A UN report puts Punjab as the new hub of drug trafficking in India. Traffickers use the cities of Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Ferozepur, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur, Ludhiana, Patiala and Chandigarh to smuggle narcotic substances through the state. So, isn""t the police doing anything?
""You can always spot a police Gypsy near the drug supplier""s place. That""s not to check the criminals but to pounce on us buyers for their cut,"" says an addict requesting anonymity. Apolice official admits that many of his officers survive on peddlers"" money. Recent cases, like that of Saji Mohan"" who was zonal director of Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) here and was caught in a drugs racket and for embezzlement of Rs 14 lakh during his tenure""prove how deep the nexus runs. Only last week NCB, Mumbai, arrested suspended Punjab Police inspector Jagdish Singh and three others with party drugs worth nearly Rs 20 crore. Singh, a recipient of the Arjuna Award in 1998, wrestling, has represented India at over 60 competitions worldwide.
The state Government claims it has a plan up its sleeve, a comprehensive five-year action plan for 2009-2013. ""We will hit the supplies for which we plan to strengthen our anti-narcotic infrastructure and also create public awareness,"" says Harjit. Meena adds the task force plans to seek support of other agencies and NGOs. Till then, however, drugs continue to be the religion of the masses."
159,Moderation is not enough,[],2009-05-30 12:23:52,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"Americans spent approximately $115.9 billion to buy alcohol in 2003 and spent billons more to treat its ravaging effects on our bodies. We are not alone. All people - Asian, European, American, and African - enjoy and suffer almost equally. No society is exempt; the rich spend discretionary income while the poor spend sustenance money; liberal societies buy it from the local liquor stores and conservative societies get surreptitious home delivery. And our world has about 140 million LUI - living under the influence.
One of them may be Mark, your high school buddy who staggers towards you and slurs at your class reunion. You notice: Mark has changed more than others; he looks different - the purplish hue of his face, red dots below his visible collar bone, lush thick hair, his tremulous hands with pink palms - he has aged more. You suspect alcohol. How do you verify? Simple: apply the CAGE test. Ask four questions.
Abuse
Are you concerned that you may be drinking too much and want to cut down? Are you annoyed when asked about your alcohol habit? Do you feel guilty about drinking? Do you need an 'eye opener' - a drink early in the morning just to get started? If Mark cares to entertain your curiosity and says yes to at least two questions, he has a problem.
Your classmate, like millions of others, was probably genetically predisposed - not by a single gene but a complex interaction of a number of genes acting in cohesion. His nurture was also permissive; his father relaxed with a six-pack of beer after work. And Mark's enabling peers started drinking in high school. He fell into the trap of early start like many teenagers but unlike them he was unlucky and succumbed to his genes.
Mark started with beer. ""I don't do hard liquor, just beer."" He had heard his dad announce in a moral tone many times. So beer was OK. And so was its euphoria and adventure. He drank mostly over the weekends and sometime sipped a beer or two during the week. His liver kept up with his pace; it slogged overtime and manufactured more enzymes to detoxify the poison.
The metabolism would convert alcohol into acetaldehyde. Excess of acetaldehyde would flush his skin; give him headache, nausea and stomach pain - a hangover. Another enzyme - acetaldehyde dehydrogenase - would now rush to his rescue by neutralising accumulated acetaldehyde and relieve him of misery.
Mark, propelled by his dad's genes and convinced by his morality, did not seek any help. It was just beer, after all. But that did not last long.
On his prom night Mark, dressed up in a rented tux, bought a bottle of Champagne and twenty-four long stem red roses. He borrowed his dad's car and went to pick up his sweetheart, only to find that she had gone with his best friend. He drove back home, parked his car in his driveway and found solace in a bottle of Champagne, which he had planned to share with her but had to gulp it all alone. A swirling head, high bass rap on the radio and vivid red colour of the leftover rose bouquet made the evening bearable.
When he woke up, he found himself crumpled in the driver's seat.
Next night and for many nights after, he craved for the same effect. But he had to drink more to get the buzz.
After high school Mark worked as a painter and made enough money to buy cheap hard liquor. He could not wait for his two off days every week, when he would binge with his friends.
Sometimes it went nonstop for twenty-four hours, only to leave him deathly sick afterwards.
Three years later, he decided to become a truck driver and he tried to stop drinking. But he suffered tremors, sweaty palms, racing heart and confused thoughts. He had to drink just to steady himself. He had developed four cardinal features of alcoholism: tolerance - drinking more to replicate pleasure; craving - compulsive need to drink; loss of control to stop after starting; and withdrawal symptoms if he stopped.
Mark had graduated from high school into the fraternity of approximately 20 million alcoholics in the US. Alcohol abuse takes it toll.
WHO estimates, alcohol causes 4.4 per cent of the world morbidity and 3.7 per cent of world mortality. In the US, an estimated 100,000 people die of alcohol linked events, which include respiratory infections, heart failure, liver diseases, accidents, car crashes, suicides and homicides.
Alcohol is a link in 40 per cent of auto accident deaths, 30 per cent of suicides and 60 per cent of homicides. And all this comes with a heavy financial burden. In 2002, the WHO estimated, between $ 210 billion and $ 665 billion was the cost of global alcohol abuse.
Prohibition
We have no cure for this disease. A preventive approach of legal prohibition by the government or abstinence by the individual has been the historical solution.
After the US Civil War, the temperance movement morphed into a National Prohibition Party and became a loud cry for preserving the family and eradicating the immorality of alcohol.
In 1919, with prohibition law about to become national, a leader, Billy Sunday, addressed 10,000 people.
""The reign of tears is over. The slums will soon be a memory. We will turn our prisons into factories and our jails into storehouses and corncribs."" By 1933, it was obvious that prohibition had not delivered the promised utopia to American society and the law was repealed.
In 1935, two alcoholics - Robert Smith, a doctor and Bill Wilson, a stockbroker - met and started the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) fraternity.
The main premise was that an alcoholic is powerless over his drinking habit and a support group suffering from the same condition will help him in achieving abstinence. It recognises that alcoholism is an inborn disease, and hence a lifelong condition.
An alcoholic is constantly on the brink - always recovering but never recovered.
A demands total abstinence and a need to surrender to a higher power to gain control of life. AA mixes the biological etiology of alcoholism with a quasireligious cure and has occupied the therapeutic space with considerable success.
Recently the quest for a gene that predisposes to alcoholism has accelerated.
Evidence points to chromosome 15 and multiple genes closely located on this chromosome seem to play a part. Alcoholism may also be closely related to nicotine addiction, anxiety state and possibly 'over active' brain seeking comfort in alcohol.
Cure But the mechanism is far from clear. Many Chinese and Japanese are fortunate to carry a mutant gene, which renders the detoxifying enzyme - acetaldehyde dehydrogenase - ineffective.
After a drink they accumulate acetaldehyde, which takes all the fun out of alcohol and gives them all the horrible effects. The mutation protects them from alcoholism. Some drugs also imitate this effect. Doctors have used drugs like Antabuse to inactivate acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, which makes drinking a punishing habit. But alcoholics must swallow this pill before they drink and obliging alcoholics are rare.
Since we do not understand the biology of the disease, our approach to therapy - by abstinence or prohibition - has not changed in centuries. We have invoked political-social-moral-religious-economic-legal methods with limited success. While we have started drinking early in life, the consumption has stayed almost unchanged for the past 150 years in the USA. Annual per capita consumption was 8.59 litres in 2006, 9.84 litres in 1906 and 7.9 litres in 1850. Based on the current data, the WHO has suggested some therapeutic strategies in March 2008. They include political commitment, raising awareness, community action, screening, and establishing public policy about marketing, availability, pricing, production and drunk driving.
We hope, that in the near future, cure will come from understanding the genetics of this disease, yet till that time no society can wish away alcohol and its serious consequences. It may help if we change our perception about alcohol.
As Abraham Lincoln observed about alcohol in his contemporary society, ""None seemed to think the injury arose from the use of a bad thing, but from the abuse of a very good thing."" The attitude has not changed; we still find a desirable goodness in a cocktail.

160,Alcoholism on campus is worse than ragging: SC,[],2009-04-24 20:55:02,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"The Supreme Court has reserved verdict to issuing fresh guidelines to deal with the ragging menace; but observed that alcoholism on the campus is worse than ragging.
A bench of Justice Arijit Pasayat and Justice A.K. Ganguly made this observation hearing into a ragging matter pertaining to the cases in Dr Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College, Himachal Pradesh where Amann Kachroo lost his life and another case in Bapatla Agriculture Engineering College in Andhra Pradesh where a 20-year-old girl, Nadiminti Triveni, attempted suicide due to excessive ragging.
The R.K. Raghavan Committee inquired into the cases and submitted a report to the apex court which was the basis of debate. The court was assisted by the Additional Solicitor-General Gopal Subramanian, acting as amicus curiae in the matter, read out the findings of Raghavan.
The committee made recommendations like: a panel of psychiatrists in every college to sensitise the freshers, senior students and the staff; de-recognising a college if it fails to curb ragging; issues of alcoholism and drug abuse in hostels a contributing factor to ragging.
The prevalence of alcoholism and drug abuse in the campuses promoted Justice Pasayat to remark: “The shocking findings reflect the degradation of value system in society. The entire value system has gone.”
The bench observed that ragging tendencies and drug and alcohol abuse results “when either parental control is in excess or when there is total lack of it.” Justice Ganguly observed that much more shocking than ragging is the finding that there exists rampant alcoholism on the campuses. “The gun culture will come here very soon” as in the US where armed students go on killing sprees.
While Gopal Subramanium suggested a need for a full-time wardens in all the hostels to check ragging incidents and fix responsibility with local government functionary like “to make the SHO or the Superintendent of Police responsible for ensuring that no incidents of ragging take place.”
Online anti-ragging database
Rajendra Kachroo, the father of ragging victim Amann Kachroo, emphasised on the need for an anti-ragging online database on where affidavits can be filed by students, parents and any one, even anonymously, directly on the website to encourage reporting by providing a viable and prompt mechanism for action against ragging with the idea of ‘prevention’ rather than ‘punishment.’
The court, however, reserved its order on framing of further guidelines to curb ragging incidents, and sought more suggestions from amicus curiae and the lawyers representing Andhra Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh.
In its previous hearing, the bench, taking strong exception, had recommended suspension of Suresh Sankhayan, the former principal of Dr Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College."
161,BMW case: Judgement likely today,[],2008-09-02 11:03:23,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"After many twists and turns, the judgement in the nine-year-old BMW hit-and-run case is likely on Tuesday. Sanjeev Nanda, son of arms dealer Suresh Nanda, is accused of mowing down six people under his car here and the prosecution has demanded life imprisonment for him.
Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Kumar on Aug 26 reserved order for pronouncement of judgement on Sep 2 after hearing the final arguments from the prosecution and defence.
According to the prosecution, Nanda mowed down six people, including three policemen, with his BMW car on Jan 10, 1999, in Lodhi Colony in south Delhi.
However, legal experts feel that the Delhi High Court ruling debarring R K Anand and I U Khan, who were the lawyers in the case, from practising for four months after finding them guilty of trying to bribe key witness Sunil Kulkarni, can have a bearing on the lower court ruling.
The division bench had debarred Anand, the defence lawyer, and Khan, the special public prosecutor, from practising and slapped them with a fine of Rs.2,000 each after establishing the authenticity of a sting operation conducted by the a news channel.
""The high court ruling will definitely have an impact on the lower court judgement. The case can take a new turn,"" said a senior lawyer wishing anonymity.
During the arguments, the prosecution has alleged that Nanda was in an inebriated state at the time of the accident.
""Nanda was in an inebriated condition. His blood alcohol content level was 115 mg/dl on the afternoon of the day of incident,"" public prosecutor Rajeev Mohan had told the court.
Mohan said the accused had the knowledge that his action was likely to cause death.
The defence concluded its final arguments on Aug 20.
The prosecution has charged Nanda and co-accused Manik Kapoor under section 304 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), dealing with culpable homicide not amounting to murder, which prescribe life imprisonment as maximum punishment.
The defence has maintained that it is at best a case of simple accident under IPC section 304A (causing death by negligence), which prescribes a maximum of two years' jail term. They say the accused had no intention whatsoever to kill.
Defence counsel Prem Kumar said it was a simple accident as the accused did not intend to kill and that while every accident is unfortunate, court decisions cannot be guided by emotions.
The prosecution has refuted the contention of the other co-accused - Rajeev Gupta, Bhola Nath and Shyam Singh, who had helped to clean the car after the accident - that they did not cause destruction of evidence as they were not aware of the incident.
While Nanda and Kapoor are booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, Gupta and two others are accused of destroying evidence.
Those killed in the accident were Mehdi Hasan, Nazir and Ghulam and three constables Rajan Kumar, Ram Raj and Perulal."

A spate of cold, calculated murders masterminded by women, in the last few years, has challenged the basic norms of understanding “feminine” behaviour.
But who said women had monopoly over “nurturance” alone. While interviewing women involved in the 1993 riots, three sentences uttered by them still ring in my ears: “Hamare hathon me bhi taqat hai”, “Hum abhi chup nahin rah sakte”, and “Hum kuch galat nahin kar rahen hain”.
Metaphorically, these expressions are a product of complex historical processes where chronic trauma has been a reality. The collective subconscious has been inundated with insults from eve-teasers, chauvinistic feudal families, rapists and many more.
The visual of an honour killing in a village repulsively reverberates across the “psyche” of the country, more so of women.
Though a large number of women live apparently unscathed lives, yet the seething anger is passed on to their daughters.
“I feel like stabbing my relative who was all over me when I was a kid” and “I have made my daughter strong so that she will not take shit like me” are sentences uttered by at least one-fifth of the women. News about women killing their lovers/husband fill crime pages today.
All of them believe that the “anonymity” of cities hit by reckless globalisation will be an armour. None feels the need to talk to a sympathetic adult about their turmoil.
Disconnection between human beings is a bigger virus than HIV and the large gatherings at religious discourses are just a superficial balm.
The Indian woman is also asking for more. Equity, excitement and empowerment are global utterances which are now being echoed in Mera Bharat Mahan. The middle class bahu wants freedom in the kitchen, bedroom and the bank, failing which she is prepared to walk out.
Cutting the murdered body into many pieces by the Mumbai couple is an extreme example of dehumanisation. The country is passing through a chronic disaster syndrome with terrorism, Naxal violence, and micro-macro disasters hitting us repeatedly.
The angst of globalisation leads to a peculiar anger leading to violence, suicide, depression, addiction, sexual offences and dehumanisation.
I have come across stories of young girls killing their severely-abusive alcoholic fathers and escaping punishment as the society justified it. These acts are a process of normalisation of women that is leaving men shell-shocked.
“We were conned in being made to believe like sacrificial martyr goddesses which we are not...we are as vulnerable as men...let us be simply normal”, is an echo one hears repeatedly."
163,Crimes of passion,[],2008-06-17 01:49:18,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"Sex was a small price that wannabe Kannada actor Maria Susairaj was willing to pay for success in the country’s glamour capital. She found the means to that end in Neeraj Grover, a media professional working with Synergy Adlabs, who would help her further her acting career in Bollywood.
At the same time, she continued a long-distance relationship with steady boyfriend Lieutenant Emile Jerome, who loved her “desperately and wanted to get engaged”, says Additional Commissioner of Mumbai Police (Crime) Deven Bharti.
But while Susairaj was busy furthering her relationship with Grover, engagement with Jerome was not top priority. On May 6, when Susairaj realised Grover wasn’t giving her a role, she turned to boyfriend Jerome, who flew down from Kochi to Mumbai on the morning of May 7 and killed Grover.
Call it a diabolical or primordial act of a jealous lover, but the darker side of India’s sexual revolution is now coming to the fore, where passion is rarely accompanied by reason.
Along with eating and drinking habits, sexual behaviour too has become globalised, where pursuit of heady pleasures isn’t taboo and trading sexual favours for professional growth is no longer considered unethical.
Gone are the days of straitjacketed relationships, which were defined by propriety and social acceptance. Today, what’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.
As women gallop towards professional success, they are leaving convention and their Laxman Rekhas far behind.
In post-modern India, a new bharatiya nari is emerging, one who is unshackling the traditional stereotypes to pursue material, professional and sexual ambitions with equal gusto.

For the new Indian woman, granting sexual favours for professional gains is like drinking coffee, claims one counsellor attached to a large corporate. The same woman today can kill her husband or lover if he proves to be an inconvenient obstruction in the larger scheme of things.
Adds Harish Shetty, social psychiatrist: “The women are saying that they can do what they want in a recklessly fast world. The walk of a woman has changed today, gone is the coy, shy woman. Women are demanding more of everything today, including intimacy. Having seen discrimination and abuse, women today want to hit back.”
Be it a small-time actor or a highprofile socialite, pursuit of personal pleasures is the mantra of this ‘Me Inc’. Last year, a high-profile business magnate hired a detective agency to shadow his socialite-turned-fashion designer wife’s movements.
In April 2007, a city tabloid set the grapevine rolling with news of her hush-hush affair with her best friend’s husband. The SMS exchange nailed the couple and the enraged businessman asked her to leave the house.
A series of denial-interviews later, the two couples are back to business again.
Says matrimonial lawyer Mrunalini Deshmukh: “The ratio of men and women indulging in extra-marital affairs is 50:50. Ten years ago, it would be 70 per cent men in such relationships. The approach to life has changed. People believe that they have only one life, so they must live it to the fullest. There is no ‘we’ left in a relationship; there’s only ‘I’.”
Women are asserting themselves everywhere and pursuing their passions with a vengeance. At 17 per cent of the organised workforce in India, the number of women in the workplace has significantly increased over the last decade.
Not able to take a no for an answer from their ambitious girlfriends, who are dumping small town boys for a glamorous life in Mumbai, thwarted boyfriends are acting like Avinash Patnaik, who resorted to the extreme measure of killing his girlfriend Moon Das’s mother and uncle as a retribution for rejection.
While Indian women may have found financial independence, men are still conditioned to tame them sexually. (See graphic: Murders most foul)
Says Trupti Panchal, marriage counsellor and head of the Special Cell for Women and Children at Mumbai’s Tata Institute of Social Service: “The expectation of fidelity and monogamy from women is absolute. She is seen as the property of the man.”
Adds Rajesh Gill, sociologist at Panjab University, Chandigarh: “As financially-independent women now have more opportunities for social networking outside marriage, husbands are on a shorter fuse against such discretion.”
While the late 1990s were characterised by spiralling divorce rates, thanks to the financial independence women found, the 21st century is seeing a disturbing trend of rising promiscuity and crimes related to uncontrolled passion.
According to a survey done by the Special Cell for Women and Children, 38 per cent cases of violence against women in Mumbai are directly to do with the suspicious nature of their husbands.

Accused: Ashish Nandwana
Cause: Jealousy and no to marriage
Date: March 29, 2008
Place: Delhi
The case: Jaipur-based Ashish Nandwana stabbed Roy after a fight in a Delhi guest house. The airhostess with Kingfisher Airlines had refused to marry him citing alcoholism. His friend Manoj Nandwana cleaned the blood and the duo then took Roy to hospital and reported a suicide bid. The hospital, however, called up the police.
In the past one year, there have been 15 cases of killing in Maharashtra due to a love triangle. Data compiled by the National Crime Records Bureau shows that love affairs and sexual causes are among the top three motives for all murders and culpable homicides committed in the country in 2006.
In states like Punjab, Delhi, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh— where there is a high degree of urbanisation— love affairs and sexual causes are the top cause for murders.
If it’s not the unbridled desire for power and lust driving women to crime then it’s the desire of men to bring women under their control that is driving men to murder.
Crimes of passion, according to Punjab Police authorities, have almost doubled in urban areas in the past five years. “As tolerance level has depleted alarmingly in upwardly mobile sections of society, mere suspicion about a woman’s infidelity is provoking extreme violence,” says Punjab DGP N.P.S. Aulukh.
The highlight of this trend is the murder of Rinku Sachdeva in Bangalore by her husband Amit Budhiraja, a software engineer with Infosys.
He smothered her to death, after an argument over her alleged affair with a colleague. Budhiraja committed suicide after killing her.
Sociologists discern a troubling trend. A 2007 study of violence against women in Punjab by the Institute of Development and Communication (IDC), a Chandigarh-based social policy thinktank, found that as many as 80 per cent husbands justified their use of force against their wives on the ground of her being “sexually unfaithful”.
Amit Budhiraja is accused of smothering his wife for her alleged affair with a colleague Amit Budhiraja is accused of smothering his wife for her alleged affair with a colleague
In urban areas, 15 per cent husbands justified wife-bashing, accusing her of “loose character”. Says Rainuka Dagar, director, gender studies, IDC: “Social norms have granted financial autonomy to the woman but are still iron-cast in not accepting her liberty in sexuality. A woman’s new economic entity is coming into sharp and often violent conflict with the husband-controlled sexuality.”
Clearly, the social fabric is changing and so are urban Indians. “Beneath the veneer of development, there are highly literate and educated men who cannot handle empowered women and that can cause a lot of tension within marriages or relationships,” says Donna Fernandes of Bangalore-based women’s support group Vimochana.
Along with Nokia and Coke, we have also become net importers of social and sexual habits that are alien to a society which in some ways is still anchored in traditions where sex is only a tool for procreation and not pleasure.
Few men want to accept that India is in the grips of a sexual revolution, which is threatening the power equation that has historically existed between the two genders. The protagonist of India’s sexual revolution is not the philandering male, but the Indian woman.
The new India is fast coming unhinged from the conventional Bharat, where Ram and Sita are role models only for a generation that has gone by.
As HBO makes inroads into villages, an alternative morality is fast pervading Indian society, where men and women are on a treadmill of perpetual pleasure and spouses are plotting to kill each other so that they can be with someone else.
In this new India, highs come from diverse avenues like substance abuse, success, glamour and quest for limitless sexual gratification.
No longer do human resource managers raise eyebrows when drains of a call centre in Bangalore are found clogged with condoms, as the Janes and Johns by night emulate the American culture they espouse all through their working hours.
A survey conducted across India’s leading call centres shows that 38 per cent respondents are fine with pre-marital sex while 25 per cent had, at some point, indulged in casual sex.
Says filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt: “The American way of life is making inroads into a straitjacketed society like ours, which looks at women in a certain way. Today’s young India is defined by lust, love and violence, which outpace everything else.”
The territorial behaviour of men towards their women is neither restricted to any particular age group nor any economic strata. Any sign of independence or sexual adventurism by a woman today evokes a violent reaction from men.
Sixteen-year-old Karishma Shah in Pune was attacked with a knife by her friend Hemant Misal for being friends with other boys. Often parents and neighbours are caught unawares by the intensity and violence coming from seemingly “normal” people.
India’s changing attitude to extramarital affairs is pretty much chronicled by the television and entertainment industry, as the real life continues to inspire the reel.
From furtive midnight phone calls received by the husband in a Career Launcher advertisement to the soap operas on television, sexual philandering and one-night stands are par for the course.
If Mandira was a vamp, who lured Mihir into an extra-marital relationship in the iconic Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi in 2001, today all such smokescreens have been shed.
Tulsi and Parvati may continue to teach the tenets of upright, middleclass morality, but the new generation bahus and betis are no longer the virtuous pativrata wives. With multiple generation leaps, soaps are shedding the garb of morality the women have been shrouded in.
Case files — II Victim: Jaswinder Kaur and son Robin Singh
Accused: Husband Bhupinder Singh
Cause: Suspicion of an affair
Date: April 8, 2008
Place: Chandigarh
The case: Bhupinder Singh, head constable with the Punjab Police, shot dead his wife and their 18-year-old son Robin Singh before killing himself. The police claim the 50-year-old was suspicious of his wife’s extra-marital relationship. Victim: Madhumita Shukla
Accused: Amarmani Tripathi and wife Madhumani
Cause: Extra-marital affair
Date: May 9, 2003
Place: Lucknow
The case: A pregnant Madhumita Shukla was murdered at the behest of Madhumani who opposed her husband, former minister Amarmani Tripathi’s affair with the poetess. The CBI had arrested Amarmani after a DNA match with that of the foetus. Amarmani and his wife have been sentenced for life. The case is now in the high court. Victim: Atmaram Gupta
Accused: Councillor Sharda Jain and her brother Raj Kumar Jain
Cause: Jealousy
Date: August 2002
Place: Delhi
The case: Former Delhi municipal councillor and Congress leader Sharda Jain, along with her brother Raj Kumar Jain, kidnapped and murdered councillor Atmaram Gupta, as she was opposed to his closeness with another woman councillor. The Jains and four others were sentenced to life.
Giving the sanctity of the saat pheras a miss, the 20-something characters—or the new generation as they are called—are exploring multiple relationships, finding love outside marriage and even having children out of wedlock.
Says Nivedita Basu, creative head at Balaji Telefilms: “Society is changing and becoming more liberal. Thirty years ago nobody had the guts to move out of a bad marriage but women these days are not willing to compromise and our serials are reflecting this.”
In the days of mobile phones and satellite television, the modes of communication are providing newer and more furtive engagement platforms to men and women.
Outside of the bedroom, the new-age mating game is played out on the short messaging service (SMS). According to operators, more than half of these messages are generated between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. and between 11 p.m. and 2 a.m..
Bharti sees another disturbing trend in the nonchalance with which people commit crimes, believing that they can get away with it.
After the murder, Jerome returned to Kochi while Susairaj went to the police station with Grover’s friends to register a missing complaint. It was only after interrogation that she broke down and confessed.
While most try to hide their actions behind the anonymity a buzzing metro offers them, others merely give vent to their pent-up frustrations without caring for the consequences.
Nanavati case Almost 50 years ago, the murder trial of a naval officer for killing his wife’s lover made big news. The year 1959 became a landmark for the Indian judiciary, thanks to the last jury trial of Kawas Manekshaw Nanavati, a commander with the Indian Navy, who was accused of killing his wife’s lover. The incident fired the imagination of an entire nation which rallied to support the man who killed his friend for violating his wife’s honour. Nanavati had settled down in Mumbai with his English-born wife Sylvia, their two sons and a daughter. Nanavati’s frequent absence drove Sylvia into the arms of her husband’s close friend Prem Bhagwandas Ahuja. When her lover refused to marry her, a crest-fallen Sylvia confessed to her husband, who drove to his friend’s house, after dropping his family at a film theatre, and asked his friend if he would marry his wife. On being told that Ahuja possibly couldn’t “marry all the women he slept with”, Nanavati pumped bullets into his friend’s body and confessed his crime.
With the breakdown of the joint family, which provided a strong support system, people have few they can call their own or talk to.
And when there is a sign of any of these people letting them down, morally, physically or sexually, it evokes uncontrolled passion. Unlike the West, counselling facilities in India are almost non-existent.
A few decades ago an overarching desire to succeed wasn’t there nor was there such intense competition. Neither were people so ambitious and that has changed the social fabric.
While the police cannot prevent these crimes, society can play key role in the prevention of such crimes. In nuclear families, where both parents are working, social values are not instilled well enough in children.
Be it at a community level or within corporations, the need of the hour is a robust counselling system equipped to pick up distress signals in people and help them out of their entrapments.
In the absence of such preventives, love triangles like that of Susairaj, Grover and Jerome will continue to result in cold-blooded brutality.

Remember Ursula Andress emerging from the surf like a modern-day Aphrodite in Dr. No? Well, Ian Fleming had plenty of inspiration when he created that trademark James Bond moment. Fleming’s private beachfront estate in Jamaica, where he crafted 13 Bond books, overlooked just such a lagoon as it nestled among greenery on a bluff facing the Caribbean Sea, choc-a-block with secret coves, private beaches (and one presumes the occasional hot bathing beauty).
Ian Fleming's beachfront estate in Jamaica Ian Fleming's beachfront estate in Jamaica
Today, Fleming House is one of the many private villas on the 15-acre waterfront hotel resort called Goldeneye. The villas are connected by narrow stone walkways, which slash their way through lush vegetation.
Located in the quiet village of Oracabessa, Goldeneye is a 20-minute drive from the resort town of Ocho Rios and a 2.5-hour drive from Kingston Airport. With outdoor tubs, private media rooms stocked with (what else?) James Bond boxed sets, and bars crammed with more premium alcohol than a school of fish can down, each villa is the ultimate in boholuxe comfort. Which might explain why the three-bedroom, white Fleming House villa rents for $3500 (Rs 1.4 lakh) a night.
Also, there’s a price to pay for inspiration. Sting thought up and wrote Every Breath You Take while staying here.
THE SPICE GALLERY
In his 40 years with Harry Winston, the late Ambaji Shinde designed over 1,00,000 fabulous pieces for the American jeweller. Legend has it that Winston asked the king of Gwalior for his favourite cook and jeweller. The cook couldn’t be spared, but the king let Shinde go to Harry Winston, where he went on to become his chief designer.
Born in Goa, Shinde started his working life as a painter and textile designer and his talent with colour and textures stayed with him through his glittering life. Shinde’s luminous designs have lit up scabbards, necklaces and bracelets for the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, the Sultan of Brunei, the Shah of Iran, Queen Elizabeth and, more recently, ball gowned-actresses on the red carpet at the Oscars.
Almond-sized turquoise and diamond drop earrings Almond-sized turquoise and diamond drop earrings
Now, these jaw-dropping pieces (adapted from original Shinde designs in the jeweller’s archives) find place in ‘The Incredibles’ collection that is disbursed across Harry Winston salons all over the world.
Each piece in the collection is spun around an individual diamond or a coloured precious gem: from almond-sized turquoise and diamond drop earrings to a star sapphire ring with pear-shaped diamonds to a yellow sapphire blossom ring, and a dazzling platinum bracelet bearing clusters of diamonds which appears to delicately float around the wearer’s wrist.
New pieces are added to the Incredibles every year. The collection is slated to embark on a world tour later this year, where it will be seen for the first time in its entirety.
STRINGING A NEW SONG
Good Times, Bad Times, you know Jimmy Page has had his share. There was a time when the Led Zeppelin mastermind saw the stairway to heaven clear up for him every time he picked up his 1960 Les Paul Custom ‘Black Beauty’ with a bigsby tailpiece.
Black Beauty Black Beauty
And then, the guitar got stolen at an airport. Despite his 1,500 other guitars, Page never quite recovered from the shock and always referred to the threepickup piece as ‘the one that got away’. But now, to honour the musician and his incredible body of work, the Gibson Custom Shop has recreated a limited edition series of the Black Beauty.
Only 500 handmade guitars are being produced worldwide, at a cost of $6,000 (Rs 2.4 lakh) each. The guitar, titled the Gibson Custom Shop Jimmy Page Les Paul Custom, will be part of the Vintage Original Spec (VOS) Series.
Handcrafted for player comfort,the construction, hardware, and electronics are period accurate and a special finish has been used to give the guitar the patina of an aged piece.
A six-position toggle lets you isolate the neck and bridge pickups or add the middle in any combination. A push/pull switch splits the bridge humbucker into a singlecoil— a Page signature sound. Just bring it on home.
COLOUR ME SENSITIVE
Wallpaper Wallpaper
Talk about being hypersensitive. As part of her ‘Design for Life’ project, Chinese designer Shi Yuan, who works and lives in England, has created a wallpaper which reacts to heat and temperature change.
Expose it to heat (say, by switching the nearby radiator on) and hidden flowers bloom on the wallpaper. Another invention has a simple poster (bearing heat sensitive inks) whose prints take on new colour when someone touches it.
Part of the same project is a wall calendar, which bears the date on every page. As the date—and day light—fades, the ink on the calendar dulls. By the time the day ends—and natural light disappears—the page goes blank.
MAGNIFICENT PET-A-PORTER
British designers Vivienne Westwood and Ben de Lisi’s last autumn-winter range of luxury dog wear put dachshunds in customised diamond jackets and Scotties in sapphire-studded coats.
While jeweller Stephen Webster, who created Madonna’s wedding ring, kind of stole the show with his £500,000 (Rs 40.9 crore) bespoke diamond and precious stone-studded collar and Ben de Lisi (Kate Winslet’s designer of choice) created a diamond-studded body warmer for pooches, Westwood’s dog clothing line debut didn’t go totally unnoticed.
That probably had something to do with the couture coat she designed with the help of UK jeweller Issa (a Jemima Khan favourite). Westwood’s £2,500 (Rs 2 lakh) couture spring jacket was made of white diamonds and small sapphires and put up for sale at Harrod’s immediately after the show, where it was snapped up by an anonymous buyer.
Fourlegged Vivienne fans who couldn’t afford the la-la coat can draw comfort from her more affordably-priced line in collars, leashes and coats. With plaids making a big comeback, dogged designer junkies would do well to make a play for Viv’s plaid coats. They’re definitely not plain vanilla.
HITTING ROCK BOTTOM
Being stuck between a rock and a hard place is no longer a bad thing. South African textile designer Ronel Jordaan makes rock cushions that you can melt into. Jordaan, who has almost 30 years of experience in the designing field, combines wool fibres with felt and other natural fibres such as cotton or silk to create all sorts of interesting home accessories.
Imagine cushions that resemble rocks and carpets that are made up of pebbles. Jordaan’s rock cushions are completely hand-made, hand-dyed, hand-carded, and are devoid of stitches.
The rocks come in realistic looking shapes and shades like cream, pale brown, pale grey, charcoal and brown. The sizes range from small (14 x 12 x 7 inches) to gigantic (26 x 26 x 14 inches).
Both the carpets and cushions can be handwashed at home in lukewarm water. Now how’s that for natural?
PETCARE ON TIMESHARE
First there were time share holidays, where members could move into villas at places of their choice, at a time of their choice.
Then came luxury motor clubs, where members could get to drive the car of their dreams without being burdened with the costs and hassles associated with ownership.
Now, New York and Los Angeles animal lovers who cannot provide a dog with the full-time care and attention that goes with ownership can opt for flexi-pets. Have restrictive pet rules in your apartment? Or a job that keeps you out of town often? Never fear. Flexpetz is here.
The NY-headquartered company provides members “access to a variety of dogs, all of whom are rescued or rehomed, very lovable and fully trained.” You can choose to spend anything from a few hours to a number of days with the dog, for monthly membership fee of $279 (Rs 11,375). And yes, Flexpetz has different breed sizes to ensure compatibility with their members’ style.
THE SPICE HUMIDOR
FOR THE TRAVELLING CIGAR LOVER

Winston Churchill is perhaps Romeo Y Julieta’s best-known devotee, and the brand’s flagship vitola, a 7-inch by 47 ring gauge cigar known as the Churchill, is named after him.
Romeo Y Julieta is a classic cigar which only gets better with age. More full-bodied than you might expect, but surprising easy to smoke. You need to take your time with this cigar, enveloped in an oily, reddish wrapper. Smokers will experience sweet spice notes ending up with little creamy notes.

PEARLS OF STARDOM
Here’s your chance to glitter like the Star of the East. A pearl necklace belonging to Um Kulthum, the greatest Arab singer of the 20th century, is up for grabs. Um Kulthum, who was known as ‘The Shining Star of the East,’ was so revered in the mid-eastern world that she used to be received with the same ceremony as heads of state when she visited any Arab country.
Pearl necklace Pearl necklace
When the Egyptian singer died in 1975, her funeral drew more than four million people to the streets of Cairo. The necklace, expected to fetch $80,000-120,000 (Rs 32.3 lakh-Rs 48.4 lakh) at a Christie’s auction of Contemporary Jewels and Watches in Dubai on April 29, was gifted to the singer by the late ruler of the UAE, Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan.
The nine-row pearl necklace with multi-coloured enamel and white stone details, in the style of a traditional Indian satlada necklace, was created in the 1880s. Made of 1,888 pearls, it will go on exhibition at Christie’s New York from April 11 to 14 before being put on display at the Jumeirah Emirates Towers Hotel, Dubai on April 27."

The latest Talibanisation of Bangalore (a term once aptly used to describe a protest against a play I directed), has ensured excise collections falling by 30 per cent, a rise in the obesity levels of Bangaloreans (we’re gulping down the beers with no way to burn off the calories), and even less entertainment for the single, 30-something girl when she’s out on the town. Like the lack of single, 30-something men in the city wasn’t bad enough.
Since we are independent, Carrie Bradshaw-worshipping girls, we end up going out with our girlfriends pretty often and it’s usually a load of fun. We have a couple of drinks (or not), chomp on some snacks, dance a lot and go home with the designated non-drinking driver. It’s all about de-stressing in a chilled space with good music and sparkling conversation.
If only the authorities would get that nightlife’s not just about the alcohol, but also the ambience, the relaxation, the exchange of ideas and opinions. Sigh. When someone suggested we try out ladies’ night at some of the bars in town, it sounded pretty par for Wednesday night course, except this way we might get a free drink and discounted chicken tikkas.
Ladies chilling out at Blue Bar Ladies chilling out at Blue Bar
At least someone realises the value we girls add to a nightspot and wants to reward us for it, I thought. I was so wrong. I’ve done this ladies’ night thing a couple of times before and I remember free champagne in F-bar, complimentary starters somewhere else and two drinks for the price of one in Maya (fabulous Cosmopolitans).
I also recall how happy the guys who escorted us were. Hmm. Maybe ladies’ night is a clever ploy designed by men to give their brethren a break from expensive dates. I remember a couple of other bars like Hypnos and Sutra, allowing girls in without the cover charge to boogie the night away, drinks optional. Ice used to give out a couple of free drinks per girl. The Beach, according to one of my young friends, would dole out larger drinks to the girls.
But in our 24-hour city with a three hour nightlife, things have gone from bad to worse. Ladies’ nights in most pubs and bars have been cancelled because owners just can’t afford it anymore. Who’d want to give out free drinks when their revenues are so down (by 60 per cent since 2005’s Draconian 11 p.m. rule was put in force, according to a reliable source)? And Bangalore girls aren’t exactly shy, retiring types who’ll be done after one sherry. No thank you; we want a pitcher or a peg or three.
So I tried Ice, Taika and Blue Bar. No luck. Then a little birdie told me that Tavern and Hypnos have clung to this fabulous tradition. I set off with my girl-gang in tow. Only to find that both these places had ladies’ nights up to 9 p.m. only! Do they expect people to start partying at tea time? There is no way I can finish work, walk my dog, shower and reach anywhere before 9 p.m. on a weekday. And what was the special deal, I asked. Free shots? Unlimited snacks? Nope. Just discounted drinks.
And guess what. Obviously, all the ladies had come and gone, because on ladies’ night, we were the ONLY ladies there. Perhaps the boys had come in anticipation of the ladies flocking there for the unbeatable offer of 10 per cent off on beer.
And I finally saw the rationale of ladies’ night—the girls come for the free stuff, the guys come because the girls are there! So that was a bit of a flop. However, in the spirit of investigation, I decided to list out the best watering holes for girls to go to on their own in Bangalore. For a girls’ night out. Because a group of dressed up girls in a mood to have a rocking time always attracts attention, it makes sense to go to places where the attention will stay just that, and not become intrusive (unless you want it to).
Bangalore is a city where you can go out in a gaggle of girls and not get harassed or felt up too much, although I wouldn’t go out for a drink alone after dark.
Coffee and lunch are fine, but dusk brings notions of notoriety and bad pick-up lines. Groups are much better. Blue Bar is very girl friendly because the crowd is usually good. If you’re looking at something mid-range, try Opus, which has a nice family sort of ambience and encourages loud boisterous singing, which is always a good thing. Pecos is peopled with a crowd that just doesn’t give a rodent’s behind about who’s on the next table, so it’s a pretty safe bet. I like Hard Rock Cafe because of the anonymity and the great music, and I like the new i-Bar because it’s intimate and feminine with its pinks and lattices.
Taika on Mondays was a fantastic evening out with the girls bouncing around to Vachan’s lovely tunes but, alas, that is not an option any more. On the whole, the hotels are a good bet because you have valet parking, decent crowds and good decor. Avoid the mad, thronging nightclubs if you’re just girls. Don’t drink and drive. And don’t hold your breath waiting for the free nibbles and drinks. In Bengaluru, ladies’ nights are nearly as extinct as the trees."

Apart from some regional movies, he has also acted in Bollywood movies like Ramji Londonwale and Corporate. He was last seen in a cameo role in Yash Raj’s Laaga Chunari Mein Daag. Currently shooting for Madhur Bhandarkar’s Fashion where he is playing a gay character, Harsh Chhaya speaks to Shruti Vashist about his journey from being a TV actor to working in films.
Q. Tell us about your role in Fashion.
A. In the movie, I am playing a gay fashion designer. We just started shooting for the movie this month and it has already been quite an experience for me. While I haven’t changed my lifestyle or the way I look physically, I have to walk, talk and behave in a certain manner which complements my character. This has really been an ‘out-of-body’ experience for me that I have enjoyed doing so far.
Harsh Chhaya Harsh Chhaya
A. I heard that Madhur Bhandarkar was making this movie. I really liked the concept of it and shot myself with a home video camera for the auditions of the various roles in the movie. I presented it to Bhandarkar and, within a few days, I got a call from him. I was happy to get this particular role because Bollywood rarely offers experimental roles like this.
Q. How has the transition from TV to films been?
A. Well, I have done TV for many many years now and that can sometimes go against you as an actor. As an accomplished TV actor, I have to face a lot of resistance from the film world. So it is almost like starting from scratch. For whatever reason, I have not been offered too many film roles and would like to do more work. Fashion will help me prove to people that I am a versatile actor and hopefully get me more offers.
Q. What’s in the pipeline?
A. I will be seen in a comedy called Oh God No God with director Saurabh Srivastav which stars Divya Dutta and Vinay Pathak. Another upcoming venture is Dhuan, which will be directed by Mrinalini Dayal and is based on an issue very relevant today.
Q. Your views on anything Gujarati?
A. Although I don’t know much about Gujarati cinema, as I have been born and brought up in Delhi, they seem to be too stuck on traditional plots. While my father is from Vadodara, I have relatives in Gujarat in the interiors like Surendranagar and Limbdi. There is stuff about Gujarat which amuses me like the alcoholics anonymous in a totally dry state!
Q. Can you read and write Gujarati?
A. Yes. I taught myself Gujarati by reading local papers whenever I visited Gujarat."

Later, watching the news about the series of bomb blasts which had brought Mumbai to a standstill three years ago, a chilling thought struck her. Had she died that morning, nobody would have known. A young late-50s, she lost her husband a few years earlier. Her son, who had gone to the US to study, had stayed on and was on his way to becoming an American citizen. Her daughter was married and now lived in Australia. Sekhon often feels lonely, her long-distance chats with her grandchildren the only brief interludes in days of unrelenting monotony. But she had never felt so isolated before.
Loneliness-and its companion, alienation-social pundits often tell us is something which happens in other societies, the affluent, western ones. India, with its strong familial bonds and joint families, safety valves of religion, sticky tentacles of tradition, the emotional security of its rural life, and its tethered ambitions, is immune to this western malady, they say.
They are wrong. Loneliness is an old inhabitant of this country: whether it struck, as eminent sociologist M.N. Srini-vas explains, the elderly, ""who were reduced to being verandah dwellers"", left out there to sleep and fend for themselves, or brides from traditional families suddenly catapulted into an unknown world with its iron-clad hierarchy, where even the architecture forbade any kind of social intimacy. There could hardly be anything more poignant than the late Jennifer Kapoor's brilliant portrayal of the elderly Anglo-Indian in 36 Chowringhee Lane, particularly the last shot of her walking down a street in Calcutta on a dimly lit night, a dog following her-sole companion after all her relatives emigrated.
Newer forms of loneliness are now arriving. It is silently gnawing into the corporate achiever clocking 14-hour days in a scramble to the top; the small-town/village exile lost in the anonymity of the big city; children and adolescents unable to connect with parents caught in whirlpools of modern times; and married couples who live in separate worlds, even in the confines of a home. ""Loneliness is a consequence and concomitant of change,"" says Srinivas. As much of India hurtles to catch up with the rest of the world, the anchors of social tradition are being hauled up, freeing personal ambitions and internal brakes.
Loneliness does not always go by its name. And not being a ""disease"", there are no clinical definitions for it. Psychotherapist Akash Dharmaraj describes it as ""the lack of connectedness"". You can be alone and not lonely: loneliness sets in when even in a crowd, there is a sense of absence or loss. Dr Achal Bhagat, a psychiatrist with Delhi's Apollo Hospital, defines it as ""a symptom of depression, with alienation en route"".
Nor are there any clinical devices to measure it. But psychiatrists and counsellors in India see a marked increase. ""The proof is that of all those going to doctors, at least 25 per cent don't have any diagnostic problems, just subjective symptoms,"" explains Dr Mohan Issac, who heads the Psychiatry Department at NIMHANS in Bangalore. ""They don't come and say I am lonely. We see the indicators."" Sleeplessness, a feeling of helplessness or hopelessness, bouts of anxiety and crying spells signal loneliness. ""Generally people who feel lonely are likely to develop somataform (psychosomatic) disorders and bodily pains or neurotic problems,"" says Dr S.M. Channabasavanna, vice-chancellor, NIMHANS.
""Loneliness is like an ache, more painful than a physical wound. It stabs you suddenly when you are with a group of couples at a party and there is general warmth flowing through the room. I know I am capable of sharing warmth. So I come back to my cocoon. I put on the television. I want to hear voices, and the TV becomes a voice. And when it really gets bad, I take the car and drive out into the night.""
It is her 34th birthday. Everybody has gone home after the party. Shiela Thakur surveys the debris round her, tears welling up. Coming from a family of traders in Patna, she fought her way up the ladder in an advertising concern in Mumbai. The urge is there-to rest her head on a shoulder, but her conquests lie in a trail behind her. And the emotional distance from her parents keeps growing.
In itself, loneliness is not harmful-the creative have often wallowed in it, using it as a spur to, or catchment area for, creativity. Like filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt. ""Best creative urges come when you are alone,"" he says. ""Loneliness has such thirst. It devours everything: knowledge, alcohol, drugs, sex, fame."" But there is the other side, it is what loneliness combines with or triggers. For one, loneliness lowers immunity because it causes stress, explains Bombay-based psychiatrist Dr Ashith Seth.
And alcoholism and suicide often become its handmaidens. ""Singles bars and pubs are cropping up and people are increasingly stopping by after work,"" says Rajesh Parikh, a neuropsychiatrist attached to Jaslok Hospital in Bombay. ""The pub culture is a manifestation of loneliness.""
Especially among the growing tribe of single working people, like Delhi-based journalist V. Sushil, ""killing time to avoid returning to empty PG (paying-guest) accommodations"". ""I even stay on longer at work,"" he says. Professor Srinivas does not discount ""the role of IMFL (Indian made foreign liquor) in reconciling the elderly middle class to their heightened states of loneliness""-usually the victims of the NRI-children-abroad syndrome and longer lifespans.
Dr Ravi Kapoor of the Institute of Advanced Studies in Bangalore sees a similar connection between loneliness and suicide. And the link is more obvious in migrants who, he says, have high suicide rates. ""The young go away to study and are from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds. Even something like different food becomes important, symbolic.""
It is during the ""stress times"" of exams that students in hostels are more prone to crack, and a few maybe driven to take their lives. Heightened competitiveness is also beginning to take its toll. The very concept of shared notes is fading away in a world where every classmate is more a rival than a friend.
But you don't need to be a doctor or psychiatrist to diagnose this spreading malaise. Just cock half an ear to FM phone-ins, tune in to any of the chat shows, hook on to party lines, or read anguished outpourings in the proliferating columns of agony aunts and uncles. The cri de coeur can be heard loud and clear.
THERE is a discernible need in young people for an interlocutor to communicate with others, even about the most intimate or personal matters. Even if you are just a disembodied voice drifting in ether. ""So many listeners out there want to hear you. So many start off rambling and then the floodgates open,"" says Roshan Abbas of Livewire and Balance Barabar, the phone-in programmes on FM, Delhi. ""We are like bridges for them to communicate with invisible people."" The letters he gets ""reek of loneliness"".
The corporate world, where the winds of change are blowing even stronger since liberalisation, seems to have become a breeding ground for the virus. The man at the top has built an impenetrable moat round him. Colleagues are more likely to be rivals, if not enemies. Corporation heads are in the lonely position of becoming the chief by eliminating the rest, explains Dr Vasantha Patri, a counsellor and head of the Department of Psychology at Lady Sri Ram College. ""Earlier, the ascent was gradual, in a predictable manner. Now at 42, he is catapulted to the head, skipping many stages."" As he hares up, he isolates himself from his colleagues, with whom interaction was earlier fun. ""We deliberately create our own empire of loneliness,"" says Dr Channabasavanna.
""I know I am isolated in the office. I have to take hard decisions, unpopular ones. I love the challenge and, frankly, the power in these exciting times of liberalisation. Loneliness is when I can't share those moments of triumph or despair with my wife. The worst kind of loneliness is a wife who is not intelligent and understanding. And says the most stupid things in front of my colleagues.""
Ravi Nataraj, 52, the charmingly aggressive CEO of a multinational company in Mumbai-is particularly exuberant today. His idea for the launch of a product has hit pay dirt. But he can't cry Eureka: a good CEO is not supposed to take the applause for his performance. Nor does he want to show his colleagues his human side. He fears his subordinates will mistake it for weakness. Many homes are also increasingly becoming little empires of loneliness. India is now getting the fashionable maladies of the West: LTL (Living Together Loneliness). A new class of middle-aged, college-educated lonely women is emerging, and the pattern seems to cut across regions and class, according to psychiatrists and counsellors. Loneliness, they say, normally sets in about 10 to 15 years after marriage.
""My friends from college are so full of life. But I have nothing to say to them. And whenever I start talking to my husband, he says he has had a difficult day and just wants to watch television. Sometimes I wish I had never married. Sometimes I feel like running away to an ashram. I almost did once. There is something hollow inside me and I feel it is growing.""
Chandrika Ghosh, 44, the pampered daughter of a former civil servant, was a brilliant student. She was going to do a doctorate in bio-physics in the US when she fell in love with a fellow student and decided to marry. Daydreams of academic laurels were put away. Now in her 40s, Chandrika has begun to feel restless. Her elder son is studying in Canada, the younger is an undergraduate in Delhi who doesn't seem to need her anymore. Until then women are so busy tackling husbands and in-laws and bringing up children that they barely have time to think about themselves. ""Many women come in about 10 years after their marriage with the syndrome: 'What is it all about, my life? Just producing kids and feeding hubby',"" says Dr Kapoor. It is an ineffable, acute feeling of being left behind.
Time has begun to stretch before them like an endless desert. An increasing number of Dr Patri's clients are women in their 40s who come in restless and talking about an emptiness in their lives. ""There is a big void in their lives because the men have spent the last 20 years building up their businesses-all their emotions, time and energy have gone into that,"" says Dr Patri. Their husbands are travelling more. Nurturing roles are getting shorter. Children are growing up and going away much earlier, many to emigrate and join the spreading diaspora of Indians abroad. Servants, more money, comforts and expanding leisure time leave these women with the empty-nest syndrome. ""These women are not old hags when their children leave. They still feel young and want more out of life,"" says Dharmaraj.
And one of the things women, working or not, increasingly want is meaningful conversation, to connect. In traditional joint families, the women of the house may have been daggers drawn, but there were certain bonds of emotional intimacy. Cooking, gossiping or fighting, they were at least connecting. Men and women often speak a different language and about different things, and such intimacy does not normally exist between them. Today's woman, home alone in a nuclear family, not only has just those four walls for company, but perceives an additional one: an impenetrable wall of silence coming up between her husband and her.
In today's pressure-cooker world, a large number of men are coming home exhausted, itching to ""switch off "", explains Anuradha Patel, a psychotherapist. ""The experience of work is one of continuous demand. So when they come home, they fear more demands,"" she says. Hence the immediate switching on to inanimate, ""undemanding"" things: television, Internet, golf, a glass of beer or a thriller. The silence becomes groaningly loud, one more brick to that wall of silence, pushing the wife further back into her area of loneliness.
For working wives, it's not endless time which trips them into loneliness. It is not being able to talk about their problems at work. Even after the husband has finished his litany of complaints about his work and his list of accomplishments of the day.
There is a growing isolation even within families, as each member goes his own way in increasingly busy lives. Focus has shifted from the family to the individual. Leisure activities take people further away from each other, whether it is the telephone and television or computers and Internet for the more affluent.
Left out in the cold, and perhaps the most lonely, are the growing number of elderly people. Ironically, as their numbers grow-courtesy modern medicine and better standards of living-the more invisible or marginal they become in a society on the move.
TO cliched images of the elderly clustering together in parks are newer ones of them shoved into forgotten corners of homes, and in case of a growing number from middle-class backgrounds, into old-age homes. ""They can cope with their physical discomforts. But what they find painful is this feeling of desertion,"" says Sister Carunia, warden at St Mary's Home, an old-age home near Delhi. ""We have an old lady here who has been waiting for her son for the past three days. She has stopped talking to people, and her asthma problem, which was under control, has suddenly taken a turn for the worse.""
How do you cope with loneliness? Dharmaraj says that it stems from a lack of self-esteem, a lonely person being somebody who is essentially unhappy with his own company. She advises her clients to take up activities like pottery, gardening or exercise. Or even to help others: social work has helped many of her clients get over their loneliness by giving them the satisfaction of having contributed to society.
""I no longer have the strength to visit my friends. My nephews and nieces used to come on Sundays. But everybody is so busy now. I don't even want to see my children's faces today. I have become invisible for them.""
Ved Prakash Khanna, 74, started from scratch after Partition. His motor-parts business flourished in New Delhi. His four sons and two daughters were well-settled. The sons and their wives lived with him in their three-storied home in south Delhi. But things began to change after he handed his business over to them. Whatever communication he had with his family broke down completely when his wife died. Slowly, he began to retreat-eating all his meals in his room, alone. And his grandchildren, who used to stop by and talk to him, gradually stopped coming. Left alone in his room, surrounded by photographs of his wife, Khanna says he often contemplates taking his life.
Collective rituals, explains Farida Lambay, vice-president of Nirmala Niketan College of Social Work in Bombay, is another way out of the impasse. ""Dussehra used to be limited to Calcutta, garba to a specific community. And now it has all become more cosmopolitan with disco dandiyas. Dance and music are therapeutic in overcoming loneliness."" Pubs and discos are all part of what psychiatrists like Dr Kapoor term, ""healing rituals"".
While the more affluent go to meet others in clubs or other public places, the middle class is often marooned by lack of funds. Aware of this problem, several housing colonies have started ""collective"" programmes. Some of the high-rise buildings in Mumbai have even introduced days for inhabitants to socialise-all in an attempt to inculcate the feeling of community, which has almost disappeared with the eclipse of the mohalla culture, and to some extent of the emotional safety-net of the extended family.
""I don't like to think. It makes me sad. I feel like the whole city has rushed by leaving me behind. It is difficult adjusting to so many changes, and then you have nobody you can share these feelings with. I would like to settle down, get married, have children. But who cares?""
Radha, 28, has been working as a maid in New Delhi for the past seven years. A pretty tribal from Chota Nagpur, Radha has her own room and every Sunday off. Having picked up some English, she even watches Santa Barbara with the family. And yet, there is an inexplicable pain within her. Watching women walking by with their children makes her feel even worse. She wonders if she will ever marry and have a home of her own. To fill those long hours, she lingers over her chores. Some nights you can even hear her washing clothes well past 11.
Bringing the family out of its siege by the pressures of modern life and the emphasis on the self and achievement, is essential to combat loneliness, according to Dr Lambay. ""Youth and adolescents are at a loose end. Parents need to spend more time with them,"" she says, adding that they need ""more social activities, more information, less competition. Youths should feel they are contributing, not just receiving."" Most poignant perhaps is the loneliness of the migrant, the small-towner or villager who has left his wife and come to the city, says psychoanalyst Udayan Patel. Rajesh had come to a big city from a small town in Gujarat. Double-decker buses, lifts and the high rises made him uneasy. He had one recurring dream. He would be stretched out on the floor and these vertical masses, tall buildings, would come towards him, almost like buildings with faces. Inevitably, he would get high fever the next morning. But even as Rajesh dwells in the realm of his nightmares, others are learning to cope. As silence descends on Kemps Corner in Mumbai, you can hear untrained voices singing a little repertoire of folk ditties in a thick rustic dialect-songs of ripening wheat and bucolic harvests, of frolic in the fields and love under the stars. The singers are cooks and domestic workers from Gujarat and Rajasthan, displaced sons of the soil trying to find their rustic roots on the hard concrete pavement of this indifferent city. This daily bonding session helps ease the sense of alienation. From time to time they break into desultory chatter about their jobs before returning once again to the subjects closest to their hearts: wives and children and doting old parents, in a faraway village called home. with FARAH BARIA and SHALINI LANGER"

I am anguished by the immorality of means and the crude tactics adopted by the Rao Government to defeat the no-confidence motion sponsored by the combined opposition (""A Battered PM"", August 15). Never in the past had a government at the Centre stooped to ignoble means like using money and indulging in horse-trading to remain in power. While the Congress(I) has only served to further erode morality in public life, the moral authority of the Government to rule the country has been undermined. Hyderabad s.b. singh
The role played by Mulayam Singh Yadav in the survival of the Congress(I) Government cannot be easily dismissed. He nurtures dreams of becoming chief minister of Uttar Pradesh by riding on Narasimha Rao's shoulders. But are these weak shoulders capable of carrying him? Dehra Dun shailendra seinger
RAO IS IRREPLACEABLE
The opinion poll (' 'Three Way Split"", August 15) reveals two very interesting aspects of the public mood. They are: the emerging consensus on the Ram Mandir and Rao's lead in comparison to other prime ministerial hopefuls. Isn't it ironical that Rao still commands confidence in spite of the scandals besieging him? This only highlights the sad fact that there is an absolute lack of credible leaders in the country. Pune vijayan b.
Your electoral prediction does not take into account political parties other than the main three-Congress(I), bjp. National Front-Left Front combine. The smaller, regional parties play a crucial role in determining the result in a general election. Madras c.t. vairavan
The opinion poll only highlights how short public memory is and the ease with which politicians manipulate the minds of the people. This is reflected in the way political equations have undergone a complete change within a short span of six months. But the sad part is that we Indians are caught between the devil and the deep sea. Even if there is a mid-term poll, there isn't much to choose from. Indore ananth srinivas
Your story based on the marg poll seems to have been cooked up within the four walls of your office. If you think there is no bjp wave, all you need to do is hold a mid-term poll to find out the truth. The way the bjp has grown in the past few years is only because of the personality of L.K. Advani. I do not believe that he comes fourth in the race for prime minister. Next time you publish a so-called opinion poll, make sure that you present it in such a way that it does not look or sound so made-up. New Delhi asha prabha
CRIMINAL FARCE
This is a case of grotesque juxtaposition (""Gunning for Cover"", August 15). Men who are facing criminal charges are being protected by the state while it is society which needs protection from them. And the very same state is, on the other hand, fighting these men in the courts.

THE TIME CRUNCH
It is hard to believe that bereft of its Air Time Committee (atc), Doordarshan was unable to evolve reasonable criteria for allotting time slots on its satellite channels (""Air Time Inanities"", August 15). If that was really the case, one is hard put to explain dd's success on its two channels. Besides, it will be grossly underestimating the Indian bureaucracy's sophistication to blame it on plain incompetence. The real reason perhaps was the time crunch. Hyderabad Dr codadu pratap
STILL SMOKY
One can't be certain even now whether the cbi will be able, or allowed, to produce clinching evidence linking Rajiv Gandhi with the Bofors pay-off (""The Smoke Clears August 15). But it doesn't really matter. Anyone who believes that the late prime minister was not one of the beneficiaries must be naive or a fool. Or Mani Shankar Aiyar. Bangalore k.r. narayanaswamy
LET REASON REIGN
Your story on the rationalist movement (""The Triumph of Reason"", August 15) was refreshing. People need to emerge from the shadows of astrology and superstition. They need to discover that success depends on the work of their hands and not on the lines on their palms. On the other hand, it is necessary to realise that science too is not infallible. When I was at school we were taught that neutrons were the smallest particles. Now we have discovered neutrinos and quarks. Kanpur chhotechai
BIG BUSYBODY
By forcing Russia to backtrack on its deal with India to supply cryogenic rocket technology (""Misguided Muscle"", August 15), Uncle Sam has clearly proved that in addition to its many faults, it is also the biggest busybody in the world. By his abject surrender to US blackmail, Boris Yeltsin has damaged his own stature and credibility. I'm certain the Russian President would even roll over and play dead if his American masters asked him to. New Delhi samir mahajan
The US has once again established its credentials as a 'world policeman' by forcing Russia to break its agreement with India. Obviously the US is concerned about our success in space technology and wants to protect its own multimillion-dollar arms market. The Government must provide adequate funds, necessary facilities and moral support to our technocrats and scientists to undertake a space research programme to devise an indigenous substitute for the cryogenic engine technology.

CLEANING THE CAPITAL
The most important thing is to control the menace of air pollution (""Capital Punishment"", August 15). The main culprit is the ever increasing number of vehicles on the road. It is, therefore, imperative that air pollution control leg- islation be strictly implemented immediately. The authorities should be equipped with modern gadgets to check the levels of emission and must be empowered to file cases against the defaulters. Above all, the courts should decide cases promptly in order to deter offenders. New Delhi k.k. bajaj
The problems of Delhi, so professionally summed up by you, are really well known. What is lacking is any long-term plan to tackle them with sincerity and determination. The greatest need at the moment is to set up an efficient transport system by implementing the Metropolitan Rapid Transport System through public and private funding. A few zones in the city could be declared out of bounds for private vehicles. Pedestrian plazas will cut down traffic snarls in the congested areas. If none of these plans work and things continue to deteriorate, we could shift the capital elsewhere and hope that history does not repeat itself. Bangalore d.b.n. murthy
In a typically Indian way we will all complain about our suffering, vehemently discuss Delhi's problems till we tire ourselves and then continue life as before. Nobody will take the initiative and take the necessary decisions. Ideas and proposals will be written down and then be lost in the bureaucratic jungle. New Delhi thomas and nancy niggli
STRESS ON QUANTITY
Your special survey on housing (""Building on Shortages"", August 15) was enlightening and relevant. However, you have not stressed the necessity of building large-scale low-cost housing. For most people interested in just finding a roof over their heads, fancy flats and bungalows are out of reach. There must be emphasis on the construction of inexpensive dwellings and importance should be given to utility and comfort rather than merely style and decor. Panchkula, Haryana alokgupta
DENIGRATING OURSELVES
Your tribute to A.K. Ramanujan (""Without Obituary"", August 15) cites the MacArthur prize as ""the highest critical accolade in the US"", while the Sahitya Akademi is called ""puny"". The former, established by an insurance tycoon, is nothing more than a monetary award given to dozens every year-well known and obscure, accomplished and potentially outstanding-merely to relieve them of the need to chase money. Do we still need to drool over any little recognition abroad while denigrating our own institutions? Madras s. ashok
MIRACULOUS MATA
The sarcasm and tone of your story on Mata Amritanandamayi, is intolerable (""The Gurus For the '90s"". July 31). My wife and I were deemed by doctors to be infertile but we were blessed with a child only by her divine grace and love. Amma's children shed tears of joy and relief lying in her lap. We offer these tears to our Mata. What qualification, what spiritual authority do you possess to write about one who is the divine mother of the universe? Madras t.n. krishnachandran
Mata Amritanandamayi, who you have written so harshly about, is the ambrosia that saved my husband's life and restored our domestic harmony. He was an alcoholic and smoking for over a decade. Then, just one confession to the Mata brought about a transformation which neither the Alcoholics Anonymous nor a clinical psychologist was able to bring about. I will be eternally grateful to her.

A QUESTION OF TRUST
Lt-General A.S. Bhullar, director-general, Bureau of Indian Standards (bis), is right in saying in his letter that the bis is the first organisation to issue quality system certificates. But Indian Register Quality Systems (irqs), a department of Indian Register of Shipping, is the first duly accredited Indian organisation for certification of quality systems (""Certified Fit"", Trade Winds, May 31). The certification system of the bis has not been independently verified as meeting internationally accepted criteria for certification bodies, unlike irqs which has been accredited by Raad voor de Certifi-catie of the Netherlands. Consequently, the bis certificate may not be easily accepted by importers abroad. This is not to say that the bis system is inferior. What is urgently needed is a national accreditation system and organisation-like the UK's National Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies- as recommended by the EC experts' group.

170,Contusion in Command,[],1993-04-15 00:00:00,https://www.indiatoday.in/sites/all/themes/itg/favicon.ico,"AN alarming chain of events that unfolded last month has caused considerable embarrassment and convulsions in the higher command levels of the army. Top level courts of inquiry have opened up a Pandora's box, involving misuse of funds and command failure in the sensitive Eastern Command that plays a strategic role in defending the border against China and in containing insurgency in the North-east.
Key professional reputations have been tarnished. The services of a Lt General, N.P.S. Bal, have been terminated. Two major-generals and several officers face inquiries. One brigadier has been dismissed from service and two others face trial. The details have been pieced together by india today with access to reports of courts of inquiry and high-level official correspondence.
The disturbing story began soon after Major-General Vinod Saighal, an armoured corps officer and former military attache to France, took over command of27 Mountain Division on March 17,1991. Differences arose with Lt General Bal, then goc of 33 Corps, a Param Vishisht Seva Medal recipient with considerable combat experience. Bal's career had a brush with controversy in 1984 when he was accused of being 'soft' towards Sikh army deserters. He was later exonerated. Within 17 days of taking over, Saighal sent a signal to HQ 33 Corps expressing reservations about the ""strategies for the '90s and proposed redeployment and dual tasking of formations"". The plan called for thinning out the army in the Himalayas in view of the receding threat from China. To Bal's chagrin, Saighal sent a copy of his dissenting note to the Command HQ in Calcutta. Bal asked him not to bypass the Corps HQ. Saighal ignored this: ""The national interest requires that those directly charged with preserving the sanctity of the country's frontiers communicate their misgivings to their military superiors."" Finally, Lt General K.S. Brar, then coc-in-c, Eastern Command, had to warn Saighal: ""I've found in you a consistent tendency to question orders..in an effort to project yourself as an 'independent thinker'."" The strategy was nonetheless implemented.
Differences between Saighal and Bal surfaced again when Major Rajiv Khanduri, posted in HQ 27 Mountain Division, died from gunshot injuries in mysterious circumstances on May 25, 1991. An inquiry ruled out foul play. But Saighal was not satisfied. He appointed an 'evaluation committee' which recommended a cbi inquiry. Saighal wrote to the Army HQ, alleging foul play and referred to rumours about an alleged extra-marital affair involving a senior officer. But Bal and Brar decided to go by the inquiry report. Saighal was again reprimanded for overstepping himself.
From then on, it was an undeclared war between Saighal and Bal. One instance was the inquiry into the canteen of HQ 123 Mountain Brigade, commanded by Brigadier G.S. Kahlon. Saighal alleged that Kahlon had been provided 'immunity' by his predecessor, Major-General Kulwant Singh, and Bal. But Bal maintained that Saighal was blowing the whole thing out of proportion.
As the top commanders locked horns, several other units of 27 Mountain Divi- sion got into trouble. According to inquiries, an engineers' regiment was alleged to have misappropriated operational funds; a battalion of the Bihar Regiment (2 Bihar) was accused of selling coal dust illegally; and a battalion of the Garhwal Rifles (19 Garhwal) was allegedly running an unauthorised soda water factory. Allegations surfaced against the ordnance unit of the division and the ordnance set-up in HQ 33 Corps.
Meanwhile, there was a dispute between Saighal and Bal over an adverse evaluation given by Saighal to Brigadier M.P.S. Kondal, commander, 166 Mountain Brigade. Instead of accepting Saighal's dim view of his brigadier, Bal decided to organise an exercise in October 1991 to test Kondal's proficiency. Saighal complained that Bal was interfering in his command. But Bal maintained that he chose to test Kondal personally to ensure that he was not being treated unfairly.
The shenanigans continued. A battalion of the Sikh Regiment (19 Sikh)-a part of 2 7 Mountain Division-became the centre of controversy when two of its officers were roughed up by jawans. Bal ordered another officer, an alcoholic, to be hospitalised and had the commandant replaced. Saighal complained against Bal's interference. But Bal's response was: since Saighal never visited the unit, he, as the regiment's ceremonial colonel-commandant had to ensure things did not get out of hand.
THE constant skirmishes were bound to escalate into a full-blown battle and the involvement of the Army HQ and Defence Ministry was inevitable. Saighal wrote several letters to the ministry. One contained insinuations of a ""communal nexus"" between various senior officers in the Command, others spoke of the presence of 'anti-national elements' in the Corps. Some of the communications were anonymous. That led to the Military Secretary's branch at Army HQ scrutinising the annual confidential reports initiated by the concerned officers. In an unusual move, the Army HQ appointed a court of inquiry in October 1991 headed by the then vice-chief of army staff, Lt General V.K. Sood. Eventually, Bal was removed from the command of 33 Corps and appointed director-general, Rashtriya Rifles, at New Delhi. Saighal too was removed and appointed deputy commandant, College of Combat, Mhow.
Sood is reported to have expressed dismay at the state of affairs in 33 Corps. Following this, Kulwant Singh was removed from a pivotal appointment in the HQ Western Command and posted as deputy commandant, Infantry School, Belgaum. He was issued a show cause notice for the award of the army chiefs 'displeasure', and action is yet to be taken.
But that was not the end of the story. The sorry saga, in fact, took a strange twist. Saighal, the cause of much of the controversy, suddenly saw a change in his professional fortunes. He was given command of 24 Rapid Division in the Western Sector, a more sensitive command than his earlier command of the Mountain Division. His rehabilitation is still steeped in mystery and is viewed by many officers of the Eastern Command as being another example of the imbalance and inconsistency in decisions taken by the Defence Ministry. However, Army HQ sources said Saighal was given a 'second command' in view of his representation against the adverse report filed against him.
The unusual turnaround in Saighal's case is more surprising considering the action taken against others. On the basis of separate inquiries, several other officers are to face court martial. Kahlon has been sentenced to dismissal. Eight officers of 123 Mountain Brigade are facing action. And the 33 Corps deputy director of ordnance, a brigadier, who has since retired, continues to be 'attached' for court martial proceedings.
Bal, meanwhile, was given a show cause notice last October on the basis of Sood's inquiry, for award of 'severe displeasure' of the army chief on four counts. The charges included misuse of manpower and army transport, failing to report property returns satisfactorily, failing to accommodate views different from his own, interference in the command of subordinates and exhibiting lack of firmness in dealing with Saighal. But then, instead of inviting the army chief s displeasure, Bal was dismissed by the Government on January 25 under Section 18 of the Army Act, 1950, and his decorations withdrawn. ""The termination of Bal's services in this manner was not only unprecedented but came as a great shock to me,"" said Brar, adding that while Saighal's conduct was unbecoming of an officer, he had no complaints against Bal. Regretting that the action against Bal and the rehabilitation of Saighal were done within days of his retirement on October 1,1992 as goc-in-c, Eastern Command, Brar observed: ""What value is an army commander if his views are to be undermined.""
Sood is unwilling to talk: ""I completed the inquiry in November 1991 and retired in February 1992. The action against Bal may be related to something that happened after that.""
Full details of the episode may never be known. But it raises many disturbing questions about key areas of the army's functioning. Ego clashes and disagreements are nothing new among senior officers in professional armies. But the way these undermined the Eastern Command and the fact that charges and countercharges of incompetence and even a communal nexus were allowed to be tossed around as if it were routine bureaucratic warfare in a government department, is extremely disturbing. While refusing to comment on the episode, the Army HQ says steps have been taken to prevent a recurrence. But judging by the curious twists and turns in the recent happenings in the crucial Eastern Command, that is unlikely to be taken seriously by the officers whose careers depend on the whims of the military bureaucracy."
