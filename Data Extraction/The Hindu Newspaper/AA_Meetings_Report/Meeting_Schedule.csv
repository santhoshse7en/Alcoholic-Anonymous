Google outlines steps to tackle workplace harassment,Saturday,2018-11-10,LIFE,[],"Google on Thursday outlined changes to its handling of sexual misconduct complaints, hoping to calm outrage that triggered a worldwide walkout of workers last week.
“We recognize that we have not always gotten everything right in the past and we are sincerely sorry for that,” chief executive Sundar Pichai said in a message to employees, a copy of which was shared with AFP. “It’s clear we need to make some changes.”
Arbitration of harassment claims will be optional instead of obligatory, according to Mr. Pichai, a move that could end anonymous settlements that fail to identify those accused of harassment.
“Google has never required confidentiality in the arbitration process and it still may be the best path for a number of reasons (e.g. personal privacy, predictability of process), but we recognize that the choice should be up to you,” he said in the memo.
Mr. Pichai promised that Google will be more transparent with how concerns are handled, and provide better support and care to those who raise such issues with the company. Google will provide “more granularity,” regarding sexual harassment investigations and their outcomes, according to Mr. Pichai.
A section of an internal “Investigations Report” will focus on sexual harassment to show numbers of substantiated concerns as well as trends and disciplinary actions, according to the California-based company.
He also said Google is consolidating the complaint system and that the process for handling concerns will include providing support people and counsellors. Google will update its mandatory sexual harassment training, and require it annually instead of every two years as had been the case.
Google is also putting the onus on team leaders to tighten the tap on booze at company events, on or off campus, to curtail the potential for drunken misbehavior.
“Harassment is never acceptable and alcohol is never an excuse,” Google said in a released action statement.
Thousands of Google employees joined a coordinated worldwide walkout a week ago to protest the U.S. tech giant’s handling of sexual harassment. Some 20,000 Google employees and contractors participated in the protest in 50 cities around the world, according to organizers.
‘More needed’
In a statement, organizers commended Google for the response, but said more changes are needed.
“We demand a truly equitable culture, and Google leadership can achieve this by putting employee representation on the board and giving full rights and protections to contract workers,” organizer Stephanie Parker said in the statement.
Along with sexual harassment, Google needs to address racism and discrimination that includes inequity in pay and promotions, organizers said.
“They all have the same root cause, which is a concentration of power and a lack of accountability at the top,” Ms. Parker said."

Global Drug Survey set to cover Indians,Saturday,2018-11-03,OTHERS,[],"In the United Kingdom, cocaine is often said to be home delivered faster than pizza, and the Germans and French are the least likely to seek medical attention following alcohol use. These pointers and more emerged from the 2018 edition of the Global Drug Survey (GDS), the largest poll of its kind in the world that surveyed recreational drug use among 1,30,000 people spanning 44 countries.
Now in its eighth year, the GDS for 2019 will survey, for the first time, consumption trends in alcohol, cannabis and opiates in India. The 2019 survey, which will launch in November and be available online until December 30, will investigate drug habits across 35 countries, and its findings will be translated into 20 languages.
The GDS uses an encrypted, online survey platform to conduct annual anonymous surveys. No IP addresses are collected and the survey is independent of governments.
“Because we are independent, we are free to explore issues of relevance to people to use drugs and can focus our attention on achieving our mission of making drug use safer, regardless of the legal status of the drug, and promoting honest conversations about drugs. All our research is approved by university ethics committees and has led to over 50 peer-reviewed publications in the last 6 years,” according to a statement by the GDS team.
Focus on social issues
The GDS 2019 will probe social issues, including how the police treat people who use drugs, and the complex problem of sexual assault, consent and drug use. How cannabis health warning labels might be an important part of drug regulation, how much people trust their person they get drugs from, how much do people in different countries pay for drugs and whether they think they are good value for money are among the questions that the GDS 2019 will investigate.
A key objective of the survey is to understand how advances in technology are influencing drug use and the complexities this pose in determining the levels of harmful dosage and how those who sought to reduce drug-related harm responded. With countries, including Canada, legalising cannabis, the survey attempts to open doors to understanding the therapeutic potential of drugs such as MDMA (3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine), better known as ‘ecstasy,’ and LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide).
Few studies have looked at use of alcohol and illicit drugs and consequences faced by drug users in India. A 2004 survey by the Union Ministry of Social Justice on the extent and pattern and trends of drug abuse left out women. That study found the prevalence of alcohol use to be 21% and current use of cannabis at 3%. Among the alcohol and cannabis current users, 16% and 25% respectively were dependent.
The study questionnaire can be accessed at www.globaldrugsurvey.com"

Website offers anonymity for grievances,Sunday,2018-07-29,OTHERS,[],"A cartoon cat in a purple robe brandishes a tiny gavel as it comforts another cat yowling from abuse: the images welcoming visitors to Sorehara, a Japanese website for anonymous complaints about harassment and other grievances, are deceptively endearing.
“You don’t have to suffer alone. Get help from the cat who seeks justice,” it says.
Sorehara, an abbreviation of the Japanese for “That’s harassment,” was devised by a 21-year-old college student and, like many #MeToo apps and websites, is meant to help victims of abuse safely fight back against their tormentors.
It allows users to send anonymous complaints by email, without registering any personal information and is gaining popularity in Japan.
The website doesn’t focus just on sexual misbehaviour. Sorehara goes to very Japanese extremes in allowing users to register their disapproval electronically to those who offend them in all sorts of ways, including indulging in garlic, wearing excessive perfume or smelling too strongly of cigarette smoke.
Victim blaming can be severe in highly conformist Japan so anonymity is essential for helping them feel safe, says Tatsuki Yoshida, 21, who developed Sorehara and founded his start-up Quaerere last year.
“In Japan, companies don’t like to deal with harassment issues. People who raise their voices about harassment usually just get moved to a different department or maybe given a raise. Or they get fired,” he said.
A college sophomore, he is taking time off from his studies to work on Sorehara.
Sorehara offers users various options, including “power harassment,” bullying, alcohol harassment, sexual harassment and even “smell harassment.”
Next, they chose the level of severity, ranging from mere annoyance to threatening legal action. They fill in the email and a name or nickname of the person accused of the misbehaviour, but not their own email or name.
Recipients get an email politely notifying them of the harassment claim, asking if they recognize it and giving a choice of responses such as: “I will reflect on my behaviour,” or “I have done nothing wrong.”
An English version was released recently, and a Korean-language version is in the works."

Privatise all political parties,Sunday,2018-07-08,OPINION,[],"The NITI Aayog chief recently made a brilliant suggestion that, I am sorry to say, has been widely unappreciated. Instead of gratitude for expressing a bold idea, his comments provoked outrage. Everyone apparently thought he wanted to sell India’s family jewels to the cheapest crony capitalist.
A magic passport
Nothing could be closer to the truth. The outrage is as misplaced as a fish on a bicycle. Or a prime minister on a rock. People were worried that the family jewels in question could end up with someone like Nirav Modi, a famous jeweller with a magical passport that keeps working no matter how many times it’s revoked. According to my sources in the MEA, the passport is immune to revocation because of its special powers derived from the Tesseract.
There is only one way to definitively kill Nirav Modi’s passport: the MEA must get one of its agents in London to steal it, and on the next available Amavasya, at the stroke of midnight, soak it in a vat of organic urine sourced from a cow bred on a pure Panchatattva diet containing the correct proportions of Prithvi, Jal, Vayu, Agni and Aakash. Then it must persuade one of the Avengers, preferably either the Hulk or Thor, to perform a yajna where each page of the passport is torn one by one, coated thickly with clarified Gowardhan ghee, and dropped into the sacrificial fire while three MEA officials with the rank of Joint Secretary and above chant shlokas from the Niravathiruttupaya Samhita . Only then will the passport stay dead. I know this is a tough and complicated challenge. But then, so is getting people to voluntarily starve to death unless their fingerprints match the preferred rangoli pattern of an artificial intelligence. And we’re managing that quite well, aren’t we?
The one big bang reform we need
Coming back to the NITI Aayog chief, all he said was that India should hand over its schools, colleges and jails to the private sector — something long overdue. If at all he must be criticised, it should be for stopping short of advocating the one truly big bang reform that can transform India’s fortunes forever: privatisation of all political parties.
Frankly, I am surprised that I am the first private intellectual to publicly propose this idea, given that it has been staring us in the face, neck and shoulders for quite some time. Thanks to electoral bonds and last year’s amendments to the Finance Act, today any money bag anywhere in the world can anonymously invest any amount in the Indian political market through the BOOT model — Build up a politician, Own him, Operate him, and Transfer black money abroad.
What the whole world knows but few Indians recognise is that India is the fastest growing political market in the world. Political parties spent a total of Rs. 10,000 crore in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls — more than double the Rs. 4,500 crore that was spent in the 2004 elections. If you thought that was a lot, they spent in the 2014 parliamentary elections three times what they did in 2009, burning up an estimated Rs. 30,000 crore.
Clearly, electoral politics, along with the allied industries of tax evasion, black money generation, and money laundering, is one of the best performing sectors in the Indian economy. Since elections these days take place round the year, our much maligned political parties are actually the country’s biggest job creators, with millions of people finding year-round employment as social media trolls, fake video producers, WhatsApp admins, lynch mob coordinators, offence-takers, rally audiences, cash dispensers, alcohol distributors, etc.
If we want to preserve these jobs and create millions more, in addition to encouraging FDI in Indian political parties, we must also allow foreign political parties, such as Trump’s Republicans, for instance, to contest in Indian elections. Just as a company’s biggest shareholder becomes its chairman and managing director, similarly the biggest investor in a winning party, regardless of his nationality, should be allowed to become the Prime Minister of India. Imagine an election where the prime ministerial candidates are Modiji, Trumpji, Zuckerbergji and Sequoiaji! It would be worth its weight in Nirav Modi (I mean the branded diamonds, not Nirav bhai) just for the TRPs it would generate.
All said and done, privatising political parties, though a major reform, is still only the first step. The ultimate goal must be to privatise the state itself. Our passports should start saying ‘India Inc.’ instead of Republic of India. But in order to make it happen, the Indian government should first hire a top consulting firm, say, a McKinsey or a PwC, and ask them to review the Constitution from the perspective of ease of doing business. Their recommendations can then be converted into amendments that will suitably update the Constitution into a more market-compatible version. In the unlikely event of there being too much opposition to these constitutional amendments, they can always be passed as money bills — after all, politics is all about the money."

Bastianich gets personal,Wednesday,2018-07-04,OTHERS,['8 p.m.'],"I am a bit nervous before my call with Joe Bastianich, the no-nonsense television judge known for binning a bad dish without blinking an eye. In May, the celebrity chef and winemaker returned to Season 9 of MasterChef US along with co-hosts Gordon Ramsay and Aarón Sanchez.
Yet, contrary to his television avatar, he is chipper on the phone. We start with his early days as a bond trader on Wall Street. “Imagine, if I had stuck to that, I would have been retired, super rich and living on a yacht,” Bastianich, now 49, says. He was no stranger to the restaurant industry; born in Astoria, he practically grew up in a restaurant run by his parents.
The first in his family to go to college, he was determined to make it big. “I had humble beginnings. I didn’t want to be poor like my family,” admits the chef, adding, “I worked on Wall Street and hated it. My mother suggested I quit and spend some time in Italy for a few years and develop my already existing passion for food and wine. I travelled around the country and returned to New York in 1991 to open my first restaurant.”
Hard talk
Today, Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group — which the chef founded along with his mother, and celebrity chef Mario Batali — owns 30 restaurants worldwide, including the Michelin-starred Babbo and Del Posto in New York.
In May, his company released a statement saying it would end all ties with Batali in the wake of multiple sexual harassment claims made by women, many of whom had worked in the B&B Group’s kitchens. Earlier this year, the MasterChefjudge also apologised for racist and sexist comments he had made in Italy. When I bring up Batali and three of the group’s restaurant closures in Las Vegas, Bastianich chooses to remain tight-lipped. We talk about the show instead.
Constructive critic
Bastianich agrees that the MasterChef franchise has had a huge impact on our palates and culinary travel aspirations. “The show opened horizons and changed perspectives. People feel it can change their lives,” he says. What about his brusque manner and sometimes harsh criticism onscreen? “Reprimanding them is part of giving them genuine feedback,” he responds. “My main role as a judge is to steer a contestant’s journey. We become vested in them and we put effort into their food journeys.”
Glocal is the way
With appearances on MasterChef Italia, Bastianich’s fame extends to his country of origin. “Similar to India, where family and food are the two most important things in life, Italian families too are close-knit. Food is a way to relive our culture, especially for immigrants living away from home,” he says.
Part of his inherited culinary heritage is an emphasis on local, sustainable food. “The essence of Italian cuisine is hyper-regional, and a cook in Milan will always use seasonal produce. It is part of our cuisine culture,” he explains, finding parallels in the contemporary culinary world. “Campaigns like #unwaste are great, and heirloom food is finding its place across the globe. We should eat responsibly and adopt sustainable practices.”
Feel the pressure
Our conversation steers towards the recent suicide of Anthony Bourdain, a friend and mentor. “I didn’t say much about his death because I had no words to express my feelings. He was a great legacy.
I even did a chapter in his book, Kitchen Confidential ,” he says, describing how he turned to the late chef when he decided to write his own memoir, Restaurant Man . “I was trying to write something really honest and personal. He showed me the way to ensure each page had an impact on the reader.”
Depression in kitchens has become a talking point recently, with more media attention being given to the harsh working conditions at many elite restaurants. “We work in an environment of high pressure and long hours,” agrees Bastianich. “The problem of alcoholism is a reality of the industry. This is a good time to alter people’s mindset about mental health issues, and let them know there is help available.”
A recent trend finds the culinary world’s renegade citizens eschewing accolades and ratings. Last year, legendary French chef Sébastien Bras was one of many to return the Michelin stars awarded to his restaurant, Le Suquet à Laguiole, citing anonymous reviews and pressure to perform as a reason. “Yes, there is a lot of pressure to maintain standards,” Bastianich agrees, “but I think people who are drawn to that kind of restaurant want to be judged, they want a name, by customers and journalists and they do the hard work they do,” he concludes.
MasterChef Junior US , also hosted by Bastianich, currently airs every Saturday at 8 p.m. on Star World and Star World HD in India

Joe’s rapid fire
Winemaking: The greatest privilege and responsibility I have in my life
My favourite cuisine: Italian seafood
Chef I look up to: Alain Ducasse
Pet peeve in the kitchen: Lack of professional integrity"
Bastianich gets personal,Saturday,2018-06-30,WEEKEND,['8 pm '],"I am a bit nervous before my call with Joe Bastianich, the no-nonsense television judge known for binning a bad dish without blinking an eye. In May, the celebrity chef and winemaker returned to Season 9 of MasterChef US along with co-hosts Gordon Ramsay and Aarón Sanchez.
Yet, contrary to his television avatar, he is chipper on the phone. We start with his early days as a bond trader on Wall Street. “Imagine, if I had stuck to that, I would have been retired, super rich and living on a yacht,” Bastianich, now 49, says. He was no stranger to the restaurant industry; born in Astoria, he practically grew up in a restaurant run by his parents.
The first in his family to go to college, he was determined to make it big. “I had humble beginnings. I didn’t want to be poor like my family,” admits the chef, adding, “I worked on Wall Street and hated it. My mother suggested I quit and spend some time in Italy for a few years and develop my already existing passion for food and wine. I travelled around the country and returned to New York in 1991 to open my first restaurant.”
Hard talk
Today, Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group — which the chef founded along with his mother, and celebrity chef Mario Batali — owns 30 restaurants worldwide, including the Michelin-starred Babbo and Del Posto in New York.
In May, his company released a statement saying it would end all ties with Batali in the wake of multiple sexual harassment claims made by women, many of whom had worked in the B&B Group’s kitchens. Earlier this year, the MasterChefjudge also apologised for racist and sexist comments he had made in Italy. When I bring up Batali and three of the group’s restaurant closures in Las Vegas, Bastianich chooses not to comment. We talk about the show instead.
Constructive critic
Bastianich agrees that the MasterChef franchise has had a huge impact on our palates and culinary travel aspirations. “The show opened horizons and changed perspectives. People feel it can change their lives,” he says. What about his brusque manner and sometimes harsh criticism onscreen? “Reprimanding them is part of giving them genuine feedback,” he responds. “My main role as a judge is to steer a contestant’s journey. We become vested in them and we put effort into their food journeys.”
Glocal is the way
With appearances on MasterChef Italia, Bastianich’s fame extends to his country of origin. “Similar to India, where family and food are the two most important things in life, Italian families too are close-knit. Food is a way to relive our culture, especially for immigrants living away from home,” he says. Part of his inherited culinary heritage is an emphasis on local, sustainable food. “The essence of Italian cuisine is hyper-regional, and a cook in Milan will always use seasonal produce. It is part of our cuisine culture,” he explains, finding parallels in the contemporary culinary world. “Campaigns like #unwaste are great, and heirloom food is finding its place across the globe. We should eat responsibly and adopt sustainable practices.”
Feel the pressure
Our conversation steers towards the recent suicide of Anthony Bourdain, a friend and mentor. “I didn’t say much about his death because I had no words to express my feelings. He was a great legacy. I even did a chapter in his book, Kitchen Confidential ,” he says, describing how he turned to the late chef when he decided to write his own memoir, Restaurant Man . “I was trying to write something really honest and personal. He showed me the way to ensure each page had an impact on the reader.”
Depression in kitchens has become a talking point, with more media attention being given to the harsh working conditions at many elite restaurants. “We work in an environment of high pressure and long hours,” agrees Bastianich. “The problem of alcoholism is a reality of the industry. This is a good time to alter people’s mindset about mental health issues, and let them know there is help available.”

De-addiction drive in Mysuru,Thursday,2018-02-08,KARNATAKA,[],"NR Foundation, the philanthropic arm of NR Group, is holding a de-addiction drive under phase 2 of Project Prerepana in association with Swami Vivekananda Youth Movement (SVYM).
The residential camp was inaugurated by M.R. Suresh, chief operating officer of NR Group, Sindhu Suresh, director of Vivekananda Institute of Indian Studies, Veeraj of Alcohol Anonymous Group, Dhushyanth, physician (palliative care), SVYM, at Achala Hall, V-LEAD Hostel here.
The 10-day camp began on February 3 and will end on February 10. Twenty people from seven slums were counselled to attend the camp. Apart from day-long physical activities such as yoga and meditation, the camp includes medication for depression or other disorders, counselling by experts, and sharing of experiences with other addicts.
Alcohol and drug abuse has been a major problem in society for long. A considerable number of people have lost their lives or brought disrepute to their family because of addiction.
Holistic perspective
Speaking about this initiative, Mr. Suresh M.R., chief operating officer of Cycle Pure Agarbathies, said: “Alcohol and drugs are among the major issues that need to be uprooted. Through our de-addiction camp, we aim to make people aware of this grave addiction and help them fight it. In addition to helping individuals handle addiction, the programmes envision a holistic perspective on life.”
Dr. Sindhu Suresh said: “This programme aims to empower individuals to live an addiction-free life. This residential de-addition camp will make a difference not only in the individual’s life but also in [his or her] family's. The programme includes stress-handling techniques like pranayama and yoga to overcome craving for cigarette or alcohol. The treatment includes medical detoxification and clinical and psychological therapy.”"

Duterte’s critic undeterred by intimidation,Sunday,2018-01-21,INTERNATIONAL,[],"Law student Jover Laurio, 38, runs one of the hottest blogs in the Philippines, the Pinoy Ako Blog. Being one of the most steadfast critics of the Philippine President, Rodrigo Duterte, she chronicles extrajudicial killings and dissects false claims made by him and his circle.
Until a few months ago, she was able to do it anonymously, even as the blog gained dedicated readers.
But during a Senate hearing last year on criticism in the media, Mr. Duterte’s social media team exposed her as the force behind the blog. Within days, his supporters were making threats against her and publishing her personal information, including her home address and where she studied.
“I wrote behind the cloak of anonymity, because when you write something against the government, about the children who are orphaned in this war on drugs, and if you call out the administration for false claims, you receive hate from the government’s army of trolls,” Ms. Laurio said in an interview, during an event for the release of a book based on her blog.
Libel suit
One of Mr. Duterte’s backers has directly taken aim at Ms. Laurio, accusing her in a lawsuit of online libel. She has counter-sued. Another sent her an online message in which he threatened to smash her face with a baseball bat the next time he saw her — suggesting that he was watching.
Through all that, Ms. Laurio’s posts on the Pinoy Ako Blog, written in Tagalog language, have lost none of the dark humour and sarcasm that made the site so popular.
Long before she was dragged into the public eye, Ms. Laurio experienced one struggle after another. She was orphaned at an early age: She was 10 when her mother died of appendicitis, she said, and her inconsolable father turned to alcohol and quickly followed suit.
She was passed among a series of relatives, mostly on the central Philippine island of Masbate, until she turned 16, when she was officially adopted by an aunt. She decided to go to Manila to study law, she said, because she wanted to help those who cannot afford legal help.
Attack on credibility
Her online critics have attacked her credibility by saying she suffered a breakdown a decade ago and tried to commit suicide. Ms. Laurio was ready with an answer: She not only bluntly confirmed it, she went deeper, saying she has struggled with repressed anger since being molested as a child.
Then there have been the political accusations, among them that she was being paid by the political campaign for Mr. Duterte’s closest rival in the 2016 election, Mar Roxas. She acknowledges volunteering for the Roxas campaign during the election, but insisted that she took no money for her work there.
Ms. Laurio credits her blog’s popularity to a sense that ordinary Filipinos are growing more impatient with the government. Many have also been struck by her courage since government officials identified her.
In naming the star blogger as one of its Filipinos of the Year, the Philippine Daily Inquirer said that Ms. Laurio “stood out for her patriotic daring”.NY Times"

"New Year resolutions keep Capital’s gyms, salons busy",Sunday,2018-01-07,NEW DELHI,[],"From wanting to lose weight to just trying out a new look, Delhiites’ new year resolutions have been keeping the Capital’s gyms, salons and clinics busy in the first week of 2018.
Smriti Manchanda, the chief operating officer of Gold’s Gym in East of Kailash, said that the gym sees an increase in membership at the beginning of every year. “This week, we have had maximum enquiries and several people have paid for gym memberships. Every year, the enquiries increase by around 40%, of which nearly 70% get memberships,” she said.
Yoga centres
In fact, the gym targets those whose new year goal is to become fit, with a campaign called ‘I take an oath to be fit’ in January, she said. It’s not only gyms, but centres offering yoga have also seen an increase in takers.
“At the beginning of every year, we have people signing up for new memberships and this year is no exception. We usually witness a 30 to 40% increase in memberships in the first few weeks. Along with New Year’s resolutions, the guilt of indulgence during the holidays encourages people to seek memberships,” said Zubin Atré, the founder of Atré Yoga Studio in Shahpur Jat.
In the first week of January, the yoga studio saw more calls regarding membership along with more traffic on its site, he said, adding that new courses and workshops were introduced to accommodate new members. Along with fitness centres, dieticians also experienced an increase in consultations.
“There are a lot of enquiries during this time of the year. People have it in their minds to start diets but the actual rush in consultations is experienced in the latter half of January and in February,” said Dr Karun Makhija, a dietician practising in Greater Kailash-II.
While improving fitness and health is a popular resolution, many people have also been visiting salons for makeovers.
Aastha Vohra, the regional manager of the Geetanjali Salon chain, said: “Every new year, people come for complete makeovers. To change their looks, people tend to get new haircuts and get their hair coloured in bright and vibrant shades.”
More procedures
A student from Dehradun who was visiting Delhi for the holiday season, Naina Singh, was among those who opted for a dramatic change — from long hair to pixie cut. “Getting a hair makeover was on my mind for a long time. The new year seemed like the perfect opportunity to go ahead with it,” said Ms. Singh.
Dermatology and trichology clinics also reported an increase in minor procedures during the end of last year and the beginning of this year. Arpit Goel, the executive director of Berkowits Hair and Skin Clinic chain said there had been an increase in patients, partly due to the festive season and the fact that people wanted to try new looks.
“People who have been delaying their decisions to get hair and skin procedures done find the motivation to do it when the new year starts. There is an increase in people getting hair transplants, laser hair removal and anti-ageing procedures. We experience up to 40% increase in procedures done during this time,” he said.
There has also been an increase in the number of people wanting to make a serious change to their lives by quitting a bad habit. In the past week, approximately 10% more people have started attending meetings organised by Muktidaan, an alcoholics anonymous group conducting activities in Punjabi Bagh, according to a spokesperson."

Mr. Lakshman, who took a brief recess at the pilgrim centre of Anandashram in Kanhangad on Thursday evening, said he told people he met along the National Highway about the dangers of alcoholism and shared Alcoholic Anonymous helpline numbers. He started the trip from Palakkad, his native town, on Sunday.
“If one person heeds my advice, I will be very happy. Alcoholism, according to unofficial sources, has led to over 400 suicides in Kerala, and the State stands third in alcohol consumption,” he said.
Mr. Lakshman has cycled from the West Coast city of Kochi to Velankanni in the East Coast. He has undertaken several such journeys in his endeavour against alcoholism, he told The Hindu here on Friday."

"Coming to terms with a social taboo, and how",Monday,2017-10-23,NEW DELHI,[],"Sejal (name changed) was just 15 when she realised her unhealthy addiction to sex. It might sound like a “phase” that some teenagers go through, but for Sejal the curiosity grew into an obsession that steered her life for many years till she finally decided to get medical help last year.
“Yes, sex addiction is real and women can also be victims of it. All these years I was in denial mainly because of the shame I felt, and the thought of my family and neighbours knowing that I was a sex addict was just unimaginable,” said Sejal.
Sitting in a room with three other women during a group sharing session of the Delhi chapter of the Sex Addicts Anonymous (SAA), Sejal, with a scarf covering her face, agreed to speak to The Hindu on the condition that her identity would not be revealed.
Apart from her husband, no one in her family is aware of her condition. Her weekly visits to the psychologist and sessions of the SAA are known in the immediate family as visits to the gynaecologist.
Despite her discomfort, Sejal wanted people to know about the condition so that women like her do not have to silently tolerate the trauma. “Sex itself is a taboo in our society. Patriarchy is so internalised that even if we recognise it to be a disease, we cannot stomach the fact that women can be victims too,” she said.
Narrating her early experiences, Sejal said that what started out as sneakily watching porn turned into mindlessly entering physical relationships as she entered college. “I used to look forward to my parents leaving me alone at home. At the time, I felt that maybe everyone my age was experiencing this burst of hormones where sex was the only thing on their minds. But, I couldn’t get out of this phase and it only started to grow,” she said.
By the age of 21, Sejal had already casually dated a dozen men, and commitment seemed like the least of her priorities in a relationship. “As time passed, it became less about pleasure and more about power. My body would say enough, but my mind wanted more. It was then that I got introduced to another ‘reality’: it is not considered normal for women to want sex,” she said.
The women’s sessions of the SAA barely have any attendees. Most women, who want to share their experience with the group, prefer to call in so that their identities cannot be revealed. It is also not very easy for women to find medical help in the city.
Double stigma
Sexologists and psychologists said that women addicts are doubly stigmatised and often don’t feel comfortable seeking medical help.
Dr. Shatrupal, a sexologist in a private hospital in Gurugram, defined sex addiction as an obsession with sexual thoughts — often they are so strong that they start interfering with a person’s ability to work properly, or have relationships.
Bharti, a 24-year-old student, has been under recovery for around three months now. The initial sessions of counselling were spent getting her accustomed to how sex addiction is just like any other addiction and there is a way out.
“My sexual escapades had started taking a toll on my body. I got a urinary tract infection (UTI) twice and also got a pregnancy scare a few months ago,” said Bharti, who lives in Pune. Bharti, however, was unable to find a psychologist in Pune. She was asked several embarrassing questions and one counsellor even asked her to bring her mother along as she wasn’t “mature enough to understand her problem”.
“I still haven’t found a psychologist there. I take my sessions from an expert in Delhi, most of which are video calls,” she said.
Dr. Sarah Abrahim, a psychologist who has been counselling men and women with sex, porn, drug and alcohol addiction, said that for women sex addicts the feeling of guilt and shame is more because of the way they are raised to view sex and desire.
“For men, their acts are more aggressive. Some might be into voyeurism and exploitative sex, and others might be into anonymous hooking up and hiring prostitutes. For women, since the physical manifestation of their desires do not come easily, the psychological effect is serious,” she said."

Recovering ground,Saturday,2017-04-15,METRO PLUS,[]," Anonymous meeting, where I was asked to speak from the perspective of a child who opened the door to Mahesh Bhatt being dropped home so drunk that he could not even stand. He and his friends used to go for three to four-day drinking binges. And then my parents would fight. I grew up watching that, and I started speaking about it. I grew up in an environment where I could see the kind of havoc alcohol can create. And when you are the child of an alcoholic, there is a high probability of the addiction being passed down.
But my body started telling me to take a break. We don’t really listen to our bodies enough. Luckily, I pulled the plug before I needed help. People do get to that state because they don’t speak about it or ask for help. That’s one reason I spoke up, because I know that there are people out there who think: ‘I do want to stop drinking, but I don’t know how,’ or ‘Can you help me, or can we help each other?’
Alcohol is said to act as a depressant.
Yes, it is a downer. I think the issue was that I didn’t give myself a chance to mourn after my marriage ended. It’s not easy to end a 12-year relationship, and Munna (Manish Makhija) and I had a great equation. I told the world I was okay and they accepted it. And suddenly, once I was single, I was the most happening thing at all parties. But the last two years exhausted me. I did make a movie in between, but besides that what do I have to show? Some travel yes, but I didn’t quite give myself time to heal.
What made you take this decision?
It started with one message from my dad. He said, “If you love me, then love yourself”. And then I told him that I am going to put the phone down and be the best ‘me’ possible. On Christmas Eve, I sat at home, put my phone on silent, opened the windows, heard ‘Silent Night’ being sung in the churches in my neighbourhood, and went to sleep. I had to take stock. I said to myself: Before you are physically put into a clinic, help yourself for god’s sake. I asked myself, “Do you want to reclaim yourself?” And the answer was “Yes”. “Do you want to be dependent on a bottle when you are not dependent on any man, not even your father?” The answer was “No! I am 45 years old and I want to spend the next 25 years of my life healthy, be on my feet and independent.”
I think the most dysfunctional relationship I’ve had in my life has not been with any man, it’s been with the bottle. I am envious of those who can enjoy the drink and not let the drink enjoy them"

Yes, it is a downer. I think the issue was that I didn’t give myself a chance to mourn after my marriage ended. It’s not easy to end a 12-year relationship, and Munna (Manish Makhija) and I had a great equation. I told the world I was okay and they accepted it. And suddenly, once I was single, I was the most happening thing at all parties. But the last two years exhausted me. I did make a movie in between, but besides that what do I have to show? Some travel yes, but I didn’t quite give myself time to heal.
What made you take this decision?
It started with one message from my dad. He said, “If you love me, then love yourself”. And then I told him that I am going to put the phone down and be the best ‘me’ possible. On Christmas Eve, I sat at home, put my phone on silent, opened the windows, heard ‘Silent Night’ being sung in the churches in my neighbourhood, and went to sleep. I had to take stock. I said to myself: Before you are physically put into a clinic, help yourself for god’s sake. I asked myself, “Do you want to reclaim yourself?” And the answer was “Yes”. “Do you want to be dependent on a bottle when you are not dependent on any man, not even your father?” The answer was “No! I am 45 years old and I want to spend the next 25 years of my life healthy, be on my feet and independent.”
I think the most dysfunctional relationship I’ve had in my life has not been with any man, it’s been with the bottle. I am envious of those who can enjoy the drink and not let the drink enjoy them"

Peer groups to monitor drug and alcohol abuse in schools,Sunday,2016-12-25,KARNATAKA,[],"Can peer group monitors help stem the tide of drug and alcohol abuse in schools? In an effort to tackle the menace, the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KSCPCR) is planning to ask school managements to set up peer groups that can monitor and report instances of students indulging in drugs and alcohol on campus, and even help them.
Following multiple requests from parents to address this issue, Kripa Amar Alva, chairperson, Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights , called for a meeting with stakeholders.
The commission wants to strengthen these peer groups on the lines of the NCC and the NSS.
“If a student has experimented with drugs, cigarettes or alcohol, they will find it difficult to confide in their teachers and counsellors. These peer group members can help students get the assistance they need so that they are not addicted to it,” she said.
Meeting held
The commission recently convened a meeting with all stakeholders, including Education Department officials, Narcotics Control Bureau and the Karnataka State Drugs Control Department, and public health experts.
Vishal Rao, public health expert who was also part of the meeting, said the peer group monitors could act as whistleblowers and also anonymously call KSCPCR. “We have noticed that it is often youngsters, particularly those below the age of 18, who fall prey to drugs and cigarettes. So we want school managements to play a more proactive role in this regard,” he added.
The commission has also asked the Drugs Control Department to strengthen its monitoring mechanism and maintain an online database for more efficient monitoring. Besides that, they have also been asked to keep track of online sales of e-cigarettes.
“The monitoring mechanism is lax and there is a need for the drugs controller to keep a list of frequently used drugs that could lead to substance abuse by youngsters. Medical stores should be asked to keep a copy of prescriptions of drugs that cannot be sold over the counter,” Dr. Rao said.
KSCPCR is planning to ask managements of schools to set up groups to keep a check on the problem"

Angelina Jolie questioned by FBI,Friday,2016-10-28,NATIONAL,[],"Actor Angelina Jolie was questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for four hours over an incident that occured on a private plane with her estranged husband and actor Brad Pitt.
Pitt is alleged to have gotten “verbally abusive” and “physical” with their son Maddox, 15, while under the influence of alcohol during a flight on September 14 and Jolie filed for divorce just days later.
After an anonymous source reported the incident, the FBI got involved as they have mid-air jurisdiction. “The agents wanted a breakdown of everything that happened from when the plane took off to when it landed. Angelina fully cooperated,” a source told usmagazine.com. The source added that the FBI “will likely investigate for another few weeks”. After that they “will present the case to the prosecutor, who will evaluate whether they feel the need to bring charges. It could potentially be months”.
Both Pitt and Jolie are eager to avoid a court case, with the source explaining: “Neither side wants this to go to court because everything the FBI and DCFS (Department of Children and Family Services) investigated will potentially be made available to the public, which would be bad for the entire family.” — IANS"

— Anonymous
romthe top left corner of my phone screen, a tiny blue light blinks endlessly. Almost instinctively, my fingers reach for the metallic device. I tap it awake to see a work email, a couple of WhatsApp group messages, a Facebook ‘Like’ for my latest profile picture and an offer from Fresh Menu. It is 8 p.m., which means it is time for dinner and as the rule goes ‘phones are not allowed at the dinner table’. I swipe them right and click on the home button to switch off the screen. I leave the phone on the sofa, far from the dining table, but within sight.
A minute passes.The blue blot shines again, irresistibly. It catches the corner of my eye, all the way from the sofa, as I look up from the plate at my family. What if it is an email from work again? I have to check. I gobble up dinner and rush to the sofa. My fingers perform the routine again. Oh it’s a Facebook post. But dinner’s done anyway. So I linger a minute longer on Facebook, scroll down to see some photos. I click on a link, which leads to another link. ‘Share it?’ asks my phone. I copy the link on WhatsApp, a conversation begins and I wait for the ticks to turn blue. There’s a rumble of a ‘real’ conversation somewhere around me. But every-one’s online and I can’t afford to miss out.
“Switch off the lights when you go to sleep,” says a voice behind me. It’s my mother. I look up at the clock and it is 11 p.m. “You’re addicted to your phone!” she adds. Everyone seems to have gone to bed. I make a resolve to keep my phone away until morning, at least.
Just as I switch off the lights and leave the room, the blue light shines again. Am I addicted? Is addiction to my phone even a thing?
The answer could be a resounding yes, I discovered the next morning, as I made my way to the strategically named SHUT clinic (Service for Healthy Use of Technology) at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru. The network on my phone dropped to a single bar as I entered NIMHANS and I couldn’t help but notice the timing. The clinic is located in a rather quiet building near the entrance. All the noise and commotion of Hosur Road seems blocked out here. A green pinboard with newspaper clippings about cases of children being affected by excessive use of social media and gaming greets you as you walk in.
Manoj Kumar Sharma, who runs the clinic that was set up two years ago, says there has been a rise in the number of patients over the past year, even though Internet and technology addiction isn’t exactly new any more. “In Bengaluru alone, 4-7 per cent of the population is addicted to some form of technology or the other and this could mean the Internet, smartphones, gaming or Internet porn. We also receive calls from other cities regularly. The problem is that there isn’t enough awareness yet.” The clinic, with sessions every Saturday, sees three new cases every week.
Do we have a concrete yardstick to describe what exactly constitutes Internet and technology addiction? “It varies from person to person,” says Dr. Sharma. “We don’t generally use the word ‘addiction’. It tends to have a negative connotation and often hinders our rapport with patients, who are mostly young adults between 17 and 22. Instead, we term it ‘problematic to excessive usage’. The general consensus is that as long as the usage is related to a purpose and does not extend beyond that, it is fine. If you are unable to distract yourself with offline activities, then there might be a problem.”
Dr. Sharma spells out the ‘4C’ criteria to understanding a person’s relationship with technology: craving, control, compulsion and consequences. “The same parameters were once used for alcohol and tobacco addiction. People tend to want to consume alcohol when they see a shop or when they are amidst others who are drinking or smoking. Today, we are saying the same about technology. If you have a laptop or a smartphone in your hand, you tend to browse and immerse yourself in it simply because it is available. But when the usage starts to affect your social, familial and biological functions, that’s when it becomes a problem.”
“There are patients who don’t bathe for days because it would mean taking a break from their game, others lose interest in their studies. It’s usually the family members of these patients who come to us. One of the most predominant complaints is that the patient has stopped talking to them.”
This reminded me of what Sherry Turkle wrote of in her book Reclaiming Conversation, The Power of Talk in a Digital Age : “Face-to-face conversation is the most human — and humanizing — thing we do. Fully present to one another, we learn to listen. It is where we develop the capacity for empathy... But these days we find ways around conversation. We hide from each other even as we’re constantly connected to each other. For on our screens, we are tempted to present ourselves as we would like to be. Of course, performance is part of any meeting, anywhere, but online and at our leisure, it is easy to compose, edit, and improve as we revise... We are forever elsewhere.”
Across the lane from SHUT is the psychiatry department of NIMHANS, which also deals with cases of Internet addiction. “We run an OPD three times a week. One among 30 new patients in each OPD suffers from a form of Internet or technology addiction,” says assistant professor Arun K.
“From what we have observed, all the patients have significant anxiety in handling the real world. The online world is more comfortable. Say, you are in a relationship online. If something goes wrong, you can switch off the screen and get away from it. Patients say they are not worried about being judged when they are online. They can be whoever they want.” Dr. Arun talks of a girl who created a fake Facebook profile and told him she loved the roleplay involved in it. “People pretend they are Harry Potter. They have fake husbands, wives, etc. It is rather fascinating. But at the same time, it has a debilitating impact on real social equations and relationships.”
“Broadly, there are two reasons why people lose themselves online,” says Dr. Sharma. One, it is a means of coping with loneliness and boredom. The other is the euphoria they get from gaming platforms and social media.”
Despite its growing incidence, the phenomenon is not yet categorised as a disease, say doctors, but rather as ‘problem behaviour’. “Unfortunately, there is not much research yet,” says Dr. Arun. “Right now, the Internet is like food; integral to our lives. How do we know for certain when the usage is excessive? We need data to show there are symptoms and to see if there are brain-related abnormalities in [such] cases. Since it is so individualistic, it cannot be easily pathologised.”
There isn’t, therefore, a particular medicine to treat the addiction. “Generally, patients also suffer from significant anxiety, so we can treat them for that. It is a combination of medicine and counselling,” says Dr. Arun. Dr. Sharma says he tries to address the lifestyle changes first. “We ask patients to work on their sleep and food patterns. We try something called ‘Internet fasting’ where patients try and stay away from the Internet for two hours to begin with.”
Can this addiction be as bad as alcohol or tobacco addiction? Amit (name changed), who has recently recovered from porn addiction, talks of his experience. Amit watched porn for the first time when he was 16 and has no idea when it became an obsession. “On some days, I would watch porn through the night,” he says. “Gradually, I began to seek more varieties; the more violent and explicit, the better. I didn’t even know it was a problem. Two years ago, I started to notice that I was preoccupied with negative thoughts and was also increasingly depressed. It was then that I sought help.” Amit is on the mend now and says, “Nothing, absolutely nothing should be consumed in excess. You never know the consequences.”
In Bengaluru alone, 4-7 per cent of the population is addicted to some form of technology or the other"

Indian cinema has romanced the ‘drinking songs’ over many years. In Bollywood alone, from the iconic ‘Jai Jai Shiv Shankar’ in Aap Ki Kasam to ‘Raat Bhar Jaam Se’ from Tridev , from ‘Mujhe Duniyawalon Sharaabi Na Samjho’ in Leader to ‘Zara Sa Jhoom Loo Main’ from Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge , from ‘Chaar Botal Vodka’ from Ragini MMS 2 to ‘Daaru Desi’ from Cocktail , the list is endless.
In other words, the discourse on alcohol in Indian filmdom isn’t quite as monochromatically depressing as the offline narrative suggests, if one were to interpret only the public policy that shapes enforced prohibition. Sure, some movies take a polemical view and portray alcoholism as an unmitigated social evil (which it doubtless is in a certain context), but for every one of those drowning-in-drink depictions, there is a more fun-laced alternative storyline where the clink of glass against glass conveys a convivial sharing of momentary merriment. Let’s raise a toast to that diversity of delineation.

In Bollywood alone, from the iconic ‘Jai Jai Shiv Shankar’ in Aap Ki Kasam to ‘Raat Bhar Jaam Se’ from Tridev , from ‘Mujhe Duniyawalon Sharaabi Na Samjho’ in Leader to ‘Zara Sa Jhoom Loo Main’ from Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge , from ‘Chaar Botal Vodka’ from Ragini MMS 2 to ‘Daaru Desi’ from Cocktail , the list is endless.
In other words, the discourse on alcohol in Indian filmdom isn’t quite as monochromatically depressing as the offline narrative suggests, if one were to interpret only the public policy that shapes enforced prohibition. Sure, some movies take a polemical view and portray alcoholism as an unmitigated social evil (which it doubtless is in a certain context), but for every one of those drowning-in-drink depictions, there is a more fun-laced alternative storyline where the clink of glass against glass conveys a convivial sharing of momentary merriment. Let’s raise a toast to that diversity of delineation.

"Don’t bar TASMAC, regulate it",Tuesday,2016-04-19,OPINION,[]," Anonymous was formed and crime went up. Even as the Supreme Court upheld the Kerala government’s policy of restricting liquor bar licences to five-star hotels, this model of phasing out alcohol by limiting access only to the rich is divisive. The debate on prohibition in Tamil Nadu has revolved around TASMAC outlets so far; political parties have not yet spoken out on hotels that serve alcohol. A DMK functionary told this writer that the party studied the Kerala Bar Hotels Association case before spelling out its policy in its manifesto.
Tamil Nadu’s political parties have left themselves with little wiggle room by committing themselves to a prohibition wave that is beginning to sweep the country. Both parties in question have been part of the cycle of implementing and relaxing the policy, showing their ambivalence towards the issue. What they can do is to have a Plan B. They could begin with letting TASMAC survive and reinvent itself as a tool of alcohol regulation.

All set for AA convention,Thursday,2016-02-11,ANDHRA PRADESH,[]," Anonymous (AA) a non-profit organisation that was initiated in the USA in 1935, offers a holistic programme to tackle the progressive disease of alcoholism. He says that alcoholism is a bad and progressive disease that not only affects one’s health, but also drains out financial resources and affects the family life.
“The entire family is affected due to alcoholism. This apart, it leads to many diseases such as cirrhosis of liver, heart and brain strokes and cancer. Most importantly, it impacts the finances and alcoholism accounts for a number of suicides,” said Dr. Harsh.
The four-day convention will be attended by about 1,000 delegates from over 27 States and 12 countries.
Giving details on the AA movement, Dr. Sridhar Goka, Trustee of AA, said that the movement was launched in the USA in 1935 by two alcoholics and slowly spread over the world. It came to India about six decades ago and at present there are about 1,600 groups across the country with 40,000 recovering alcoholics in the groups.
The movement was initiated in unified AP about 25 years ago and at present in AP and Telangana, there are about 100 groups with 3,000 recovering alcoholics. “World over there are about 1.5 lakh groups with about 21 lakh fellowship,” said Dr. Sridhar.
According to Dr. Harsh, the entry is open for free in AA groups for all suffering alcoholics. The AA programme comes wrapped in a 12-step recovery process with a spiritual tinge. National Helpline: 09022771011 AP numbers: 9666466118, 9666466119, 9666679466, 9666679566.

Feel free to seek help,Sunday,2015-09-06,TELANGANA,[],"Anyone in the city who suffers from drug addiction can contact the local helpline of Narcotics Anonymous (NA) to help them with the problem. The group, which conducts meetings a few times in a week, will keep the identity of all its members anonymous.
The NA group may be contacted at 082975 44324 to know about the locations of the meetings. “We conduct them at hospitals, schools and other public places, but never at a member’s house. And we do not charge money, as it’s a not-for-profit organisation,” said Amitabh, a member from New Delhi, at a press conference here on Friday. Mr. Amitabh and other members said that the meetings encourage ‘fellowship’ of the group. “It is an environment for addicts to identify and help each other to stay away from mood altering substances, that include alcohol,” he added. The core NA programme is a 12-step one which all members have to follow to de-addict themselves. In the meetings, the experienced members termed ‘sponsors’ will guide the new members in identifying their problems and help them find best solutions. The NA does not accept financial contributions from any non-members, said Mr. Amitabh. “Nor does it affiliate or endorse its name to any outside enterprise,” he added."

Alongside Vardhan were other members of Narcotics Anonymous, who shared their experiences, explaining how addiction should be treated as a problem and not a crime. “I am a doctor and I was working in the neo-natal care unit. The drugs had such a strong hold on me that I could do things only when they were in my system,” said Ashish, who is now leading a clean life.
Both of them shared that they faced relapses during treatment at rehabilitation clinics. Ashish said that the cause of it was lack of a support system. “The first time I had gone for a meeting, they clapped when I introduced myself,” he mentioned, adding that the group meetings provide the much-needed help to addicts. They were both attending a press conference organised by the group here on Friday.
Benjamin, another member from Bengaluru, pointed out that newcomers are encouraged to attend meetings even if they take drugs after attending a session. “I was a hopeless person when I was younger. Because I could not meet the expectations, I took to drugs,” he recalled.
As of now, the Narcotics Anonymous meetings in Hyderabad comprise between 20-25 members per session. “Over the last few years, the numbers have improved,” said Amitabh, who addressed the media. He added that overall, the group has touched 8,000 members.

A struggle back to normal life,Sunday,2015-08-09,TAMIL NADU,[]," Anonymous at the Kajamalai Ladies Association (KLA) Trust, and those assembled here are from all walks of life: farmers, marketing executives, a former political party worker, a noon meal scheme caterer, a businessman … they are people who let their love for liquor briefly get the better of them.
As the stories tumble out and the survivors recount their harrowing journey back to normalcy, all that social organisations like the KLA can do is hope that their patients keep to the straight and narrow path of recovery after treatment.
“Liquor consumption stops the normal functioning of the body. The empty calories of the drink suppress hunger,” Mr. Bharathimohan, project director of the de-addiction centre at KLA, told The Hindu . “Many alcoholics cannot eat more than half an idli, or a little gruel when their addiction is at its peak.
This is why our treatment starts with nutritional and psychological support.”
Whether it is manufactured by the government or native brewers, alcohol is an addictive substance, Mr. Bharathimohan clarified.
“The success rate of alcohol de-addiction treatment in our experience is that out of 10 people, six will definitely stay off the drink for the rest of their life. The others will have a relapse, either due to personal circumstances or willpower failure,” he said.
“So we counsellors have to keep working, and be happy with those who have taken our message to heart.”
What starts out as a means to get attention or an expression of rebellion soon becomes a need that has to be satisfied at all costs, said Mr. Bharathimohan, explaining the psychology of the alcoholic.
In the past 20 years that he has been a counsellor, Mr. Bharathimohan has seen the average age of the addict fall from 38 to 13 to 14. The KLA has a minimum age limit of 18."

Stars before sunrise,Friday,2015-02-13,FRIDAY REVIEW,"['3 a.m.', '4.30 a.m.', '4.35 a.m.']","It’s Thursday, February 5, and my alarm rings at 3 a.m. It’s ‘Yennai Arindhaal’ time! I spring out of bed. Shortly, a few of my friends, one of who has managed tickets for a 4.30 a.m. show (I kid you not), find ourselves on our bikes heading towards Porur on empty roads, which for some strange reason remind me of the film ‘Zombieland.’ Thanks to Google Maps, we find our way to a theatre named Gopalakrishnan, one I’ve never heard of in my three decades in the city. I expect to see a handful of droopy, sleep-deprived people lumbering in. The sun, after all, hasn’t even risen yet.
What I see though… is a sea of people flooding into the obscure theatre with chants of ‘Thala’ ringing in the air. Bikes jostle for space, some fans seem drunk on alcohol, but most on the prospect of being among the first to watch the Ajith-Gautham Menon film.
We finally take our seats. I am surprised they are even numbered. The chairs are creaky, the cushions threadbare. More people pour in, and a random guy in the audience asks them to sit on the floor, yelling “Seat-laam kadaikaadhu!” Most people are dressed in lungis and shorts. Not the fancy shorts seen at posh theatres, but the multi-coloured ones you find on Parry's pavements.
But the noise, oh, the noise! Groups of men (of course, no women) whistle and hoot. When the ads start playing, the cheering makes you wonder if Ajith has walked in. A deafening roar erupts when the Censor certificate comes up — U, U/A, A… who cares?
Then the words Ajith Kumar appear on screen and as Sathyadev (Ajith’s character in the film) says later in the film, “All hell breaks loose”.

The film is running, but nobody seems to care. It’s the opening show of an Ajith film, and everything else, even the film itself, is secondary. Having heard no dialogue for the first 15 minutes (the dreadful speakers are also to blame), I realise I’ll have to watch it again to review it.

Stars before sunrise,Friday,2015-02-13,FRIDAY REVIEW,"['3 a.m.', '4.30 a.m.', '4.35 a.m.']","It’s Thursday, February 5, and my alarm rings at 3 a.m. It’s ‘Yennai Arindhaal’ time! I spring out of bed. Shortly, a few of my friends, one of who has managed tickets for a 4.30 a.m. show (I kid you not), find ourselves on our bikes heading towards Porur on empty roads, which for some strange reason remind me of the film ‘Zombieland.’ Thanks to Google Maps, we find our way to a theatre named Gopalakrishnan, one I’ve never heard of in my three decades in the city. I expect to see a handful of droopy, sleep-deprived people lumbering in. The sun, after all, hasn’t even risen yet.
What I see though… is a sea of people flooding into the obscure theatre with chants of ‘Thala’ ringing in the air. Bikes jostle for space, some fans seem drunk on alcohol, but most on the prospect of being among the first to watch the Ajith-Gautham Menon film.
We finally take our seats. I am surprised they are even numbered. The chairs are creaky, the cushions threadbare. More people pour in, and a random guy in the audience asks them to sit on the floor, yelling “Seat-laam kadaikaadhu!” Most people are dressed in lungis and shorts. Not the fancy shorts seen at posh theatres, but the multi-coloured ones you find on Parry's pavements.
But the noise, oh, the noise! Groups of men (of course, no women) whistle and hoot. When the ads start playing, the cheering makes you wonder if Ajith has walked in. A deafening roar erupts when the Censor certificate comes up — U, U/A, A… who cares?
Then the words Ajith Kumar appear on screen and as Sathyadev (Ajith’s character in the film) says later in the film, “All hell breaks loose”. Many people stand up on the seats, unable to control their excitement. Some like yours truly stand up on the seat too, to peer over the other heads. A few run towards the screen. In seconds, they are atop the stage up front and dancing, shirts in hand.
I’m not even looking at the screen now, only at the revellers. Some stop dancing, get phones out and begin taking selfies. I dimly realise that I can barely hear any music at all. Harris Jayaraj may as well not have bothered. The madness continues till the opening credits stop rolling.

Spirit being ferried in ‘refrigerator trucks’ for Onam,Thursday,2014-07-03,ANDHRA PRADESH,[],"Since June 25, eight agents of the Excise Commissioner’s Special Squad had been on a stakeout on the Kayamkulam-Punalur road.
Their quarry — a Karnataka-registered “refrigerator truck” with the trade name ‘Kingfisher’ emblazoned on its side.
Much of the 58-km-long stretch is flanked by lagoons and paddy fields.
The squad had information that somewhere along the stretch, which cuts through the hinterland of remote and waterlogged Kuttanad, lay at least three secret warehouses where contraband spirit from distilleries in sugarcane-growing regions in north India was being hoarded in anticipation of the surge in demand for cheap liquor during Onam.
Extra neutral alcohol (99% proof), which costs less than Rs.50 a litre in north India, accrued more than 20 times its original value when diluted and retailed (as toddy or fake liquor) in Kerala.
The profit margin for rectified spirit was even higher.
Karnataka-based criminal gangs, some of them new players, and their local partners had entered the lucrative racket in a big way this April.
Early on July 1, the officers intercepted the truck and seized 5,000 litres of spirit. The seizure has thrown light on the “evolved tactics” of the so-called spirit mafia, and the length the smugglers go to cover up their tracks.
The chassis and engine numbers of the truck had been chipped off. Its registration plates were faked. The driver could offer no clue about the smugglers.
A “contact” had offered him Rs.2,500 to drive the vehicle from Thrissur to Punalur.
He was to park it near the market and leave the ignition keys in place, just as he had found them in the truck. An anonymous caller had contacted him on a mobile phone he found on the driver’s seat to offer directions.
Excise Commissioner Anil Xavier has alerted check-posts of the new method of smuggling, and ordered intense verification of vehicles designed to carry perishable freight. T. Ani Kumar headed the squad."

Similar to the philosophy adopted by the worldwide organisation of AA, the Madhumukthi too involves fellow addicts coming together and talking about their experiences with one another. But this is a six-stage process, unlike AA’s 12, which prioritises rebuilding self-respect and affirming a belief that they cannot afford to let themselves rot, but be useful to their families, most importantly, and to their community, Jacob Varghese, who chairs the trust, says.
Separate sessions are held for wives, mothers, and even children of addicts, a member of AA told The Hindu on condition of anonymity.
“There are AA meetings being held in the city every day of the week. We keep no record of the numbers, and our focus is entirely on that closed-door discussion. There, only those who admit to being alcoholics convene and they talk about episodes they would not otherwise be comfortable with sharing. We keep in touch with each other, call each other whenever we feel the urge to drink,” he says. In that room, he says, a toddy-tapper, a businessman, and a government official are all treated the same."
This opera is home-grown,Friday,2014-03-28,FRIDAY REVIEW,['7 p.m.'],"(Chavittu-Natakam, the 16th century dance-drama tradition, originated in coastal Kerala, and is a the mix of Indo-Western cultural gradations. The Sangeet Natak Akademi, Delhi, recently documented the art form and its artists from the picturesque Gothuruthu, one of the few villages that have played a significant role in preserving the form.)
Chavittu-Natakam (stamping drama) is a sort of an opera. While Chavittu means steps, Natakam stands for drama. The hallmark of the play is the rhythmic steps of the performers while they enact. It is a form neither traditional nor folk in its true sense and in terms of ethnic identities, but stands somewhere in between these with a blend of aesthetics from its region and from the West.
A clear history of Kerala is available from 1498 onwards, the year in which the Portuguese landed in Kerala. The period between the 15th and 17th centuries is considered a golden era in the arts and literature in Kerala. It was during this period that forms such as Ramanattam, which by the 17th century became Kathakali, and Krishnanattam (based on Krishnageeti written in 1654) originated. By the end of the 18th century, Kunchan Nambiar’s Thullal, a semi-classical semi-folk satire form highlighting the rich literary, musical and rhythmic heritage of Kerala, had become popular among both the common man and scholars.
The socio-cultural renaissance of this period resulted in the proliferation of the Vaishnava cult too. The 12th century poet Jayadeva’s Gita Govinda greatly influenced the development of sopana sangeetam and also the evolution of Ashtapadiyattam, the bhakti-oriented dance choreography, that completely vanished about two centuries ago.
Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri’s (1560-1666) Narayaneeyam became popular among scholars and native devotees. Both these inspired the composition of ‘Krishnageeti.’ By the time Koodiyattom, the ancient Sanskrit theatre tradition, had become a strong ritual performing art inside several temples.
Simultaneously, the post 15th century saw flourishing Roman and Portuguese trade settlements and spread of Christianity and conversion under the initiative of the missionaries. When Vasco da Gama landed in Kerala and visited Kochi in 1502, a team of Christian warriors from Kotungalloore went to greet him and offered loyalty to the Portuguese kingdom.
The origin of Chavittu Natakam happened under these circumstances, initiated by missionaries. While focussing on conversion and religious charities, they developed an art tradition of their own mixing both the heritages and using the warriors as dancers. And thus, around the 16{+t}{+h}century, was born Chavittu-Natakam in the coastal belts from Kotungalloore to Kollam.
Elements of Kalarippayattu, Koodiyattom and several folk traditions were adapted to display Christian stories in glittering Western attire. Later when Kathakali became popular, its nuances too were imbibed.
Dance segments between verses are described as ‘kalasham’ (derived from the Arabic word ‘Xalasa’, which means ‘conclusion’) in both Kathakali and Chavittu Natakam. The idea was to stop Christians from attending Hindu arts traditions by showcasing before them an art of their own in the native language (then Tamil) and hailing the spirit of Christianity and Western dramatics tailored with ethnic ingredients. Stories were episodes from the Bible or about the adventures of Charlemagne or Alexander, or historical issues. Soon, the form became the evening entertainment of the Christians of the area. By the end of the 18th century, plays based on moral themes too adapted.
The very first Chavittu Natakam was either ‘Carelman Charitham’ (Charlemagne the Great), the story of the great French Emperor of the 8th C, or ‘Brijeena Charitham’ (Life of Queen Brijeena); the dispute still continues.
“Four or five decades ago, it took four to five entire nights to present a play. Today shortened versions are presented for two hours and hence several subtleties are lost,” says Roy Kolath, a well-known performer and trainer. He is the son and disciple of the late Kolath George Asan, ‘an icon of Gothuruthu tradition of the art and groomed by Ambalathi Ouseph Asan and Poulose Asan,” according to octogenarian Inasu, who used to perform.
“It is said that George asan’s gurus were trained by one Varu asan. Beyond that none knew about this lineage,” says Thambi Payappilly, another disciple of George and a trainer. Means, beyond the 20th century, the history of the art is bleak.
“There is hardly any support from the State. So, we all are engaged in other work to survive and take up the art only after 7 p.m.,” says a master who prefers to remain anonymous. True. Thambi is an auto rickshaw driver and Roy, a construction labour. Whenever performance opportunities come their way, they stop work and pursue their passion, even if it means a “loss of wages.”
Since 2012, the State Government has included Chavittu-Natakam as one of the items for competition in school youth festivals. And students are slowly but surely taking it up.
Nevertheless, the form and its productions are fast changing. Earlier musical instruments such as Chenda, Ilathalam and Maddalam were used and the actors themselves rendered the verses. During the past few decades, the instruments have been replaced by the tabla, organ, keyboard and the drums. Yes, the pastoral flavour of the music is lost. Old fashioned classy boots have been replaced by canvas shoes and more often than not, the vigour of the stamp (chavittu) is also missing in performances. Of late plays are presented in Malayalam too.
Perhaps, the most significant loss is the disappearance of Kattiyakkaran, an essential character in Chavittu Natakam.
In ancient Tamil, it means the court jester. With humour as his permanent emotion, Kattiyakkaran is the replica of the vidhushak of Koodiyattam except in costume. His funny head-gear and an extremely large belly are his trademarks. Delivering extempore humour and funny imitations of the verses of other characters, are his mandate. He is completely free on stage and may appear and disappear whenever he wants to. Even the King addresses him as comrade (‘Tozhan’).
WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY…
Fr. Joseph Valiyaveetil who has, since 1989, worked for the dissemination of Chavittu Natakam has a different experience to share. To protect the poor fishing community and labour class from the clutches of alcoholism and addiction, he initiated a troupe with rehearsals and performances during the evening hours. “The result was tremendous as the lifestyle of many changed,” beams the priest who produced several social issues through Chavittu Natakam. For the artists and aficionados of Chavittu Natakam, the documentation of the Sangeet Natak Akademi, was a novel experience and came as a boon. “Better late than never,” was the universal response."
Students told to stay away from drugs,Friday,2014-03-21,TAMIL NADU,[],"Stay focused on your studies so that you’ll not be lured into taking drugs or alcohol — this is the message given to a gathering of students at an awareness programme on drug abuse and trafficking organised by Yadava College and Narcotics Intelligence Bureau (NIB) here on Thursday.
Samiyappan, Sub-Inspector (NIB), said, “Laws against drug trafficking are stringent, and invite severe punishment. It is a non-bailable offence too. Do not fall prey to drugs. It will ruin the life of you and those around you.”
The students were educated on various health problems related to alcohol and drug consumption.
A rehabilitated youth and a member of Alcoholic Anonymous (AA), who shared his experience with the students, said: “I was an alcoholic till a few years ago. My family and friends despised me for who I was. But, now, I have overcome several obstacles to become who I am today.” He advised the youth to stay away from drugs “as it is harmful not just for you but also to society.”
The AA member struggled with his addiction problem for years. Guided by a rehabilitation centre in the city, he is his normal self now. He is running a business."

This opera is home-grown,Friday,2014-03-21,FRIDAY REVIEW,['7 p.m.'],"(Chavittu-Natakam, the 16th century dance-drama tradition, originated in coastal Kerala, and is a the mix of Indo-Western cultural gradations. The Sangeet Natak Akademi, Delhi, recently documented the art form and its artists from the picturesque Gothuruthu, one of the few villages that have played a significant role in preserving the form.)
Chavittu-Natakam (stamping drama) is a sort of an opera. While Chavittu means steps, Natakam stands for drama. The hallmark of the play is the rhythmic steps of the performers while they enact. It is a form neither traditional nor folk in its true sense and in terms of ethnic identities, but stands somewhere in between these with a blend of aesthetics from its region and from the West.
A clear history of Kerala is available from 1498 onwards, the year in which the Portuguese landed in Kerala. The period between the 15th and 17th centuries is considered a golden era in the arts and literature in Kerala. It was during this period that forms such as Ramanattam, which by the 17th century became Kathakali, and Krishnanattam (based on Krishnageeti written in 1654) originated. By the end of the 18th century, Kunchan Nambiar’s Thullal, a semi-classical semi-folk satire form highlighting the rich literary, musical and rhythmic heritage of Kerala, had become popular among both the common man and scholars.
The socio-cultural renaissance of this period resulted in the proliferation of the Vaishnava cult too. The 12th century poet Jayadeva’s Gita Govinda greatly influenced the development of sopana sangeetam and also the evolution of Ashtapadiyattam, the bhakti-oriented dance choreography, that completely vanished about two centuries ago.
Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri’s (1560-1666) Narayaneeyam became popular among scholars and native devotees. Both these inspired the composition of ‘Krishnageeti.’ By the time Koodiyattom, the ancient Sanskrit theatre tradition, had become a strong ritual performing art inside several temples.
Simultaneously, the post 15th century saw flourishing Roman and Portuguese trade settlements and spread of Christianity and conversion under the initiative of the missionaries. When Vasco da Gama landed in Kerala and visited Kochi in 1502, a team of Christian warriors from Kotungalloore went to greet him and offered loyalty to the Portuguese kingdom.
The origin of Chavittu Natakam happened under these circumstances, initiated by missionaries. While focussing on conversion and religious charities, they developed an art tradition of their own mixing both the heritages and using the warriors as dancers. And thus, around the 16{+t}{+h}century, was born Chavittu-Natakam in the coastal belts from Kotungalloore to Kollam.
Elements of Kalarippayattu, Koodiyattom and several folk traditions were adapted to display Christian stories in glittering Western attire. Later when Kathakali became popular, its nuances too were imbibed.
Dance segments between verses are described as ‘kalasham’ (derived from the Arabic word ‘Xalasa’, which means ‘conclusion’) in both Kathakali and Chavittu Natakam. The idea was to stop Christians from attending Hindu arts traditions by showcasing before them an art of their own in the native language (then Tamil) and hailing the spirit of Christianity and Western dramatics tailored with ethnic ingredients. Stories were episodes from the Bible or about the adventures of Charlemagne or Alexander, or historical issues. Soon, the form became the evening entertainment of the Christians of the area. By the end of the 18th century, plays based on moral themes too adapted.
The very first Chavittu Natakam was either ‘Carelman Charitham’ (Charlemagne the Great), the story of the great French Emperor of the 8th C, or ‘Brijeena Charitham’ (Life of Queen Brijeena); the dispute still continues.
“Four or five decades ago, it took four to five entire nights to present a play. Today shortened versions are presented for two hours and hence several subtleties are lost,” says Roy Kolath, a well-known performer and trainer. He is the son and disciple of the late Kolath George Asan, ‘an icon of Gothuruthu tradition of the art and groomed by Ambalathi Ouseph Asan and Poulose Asan,” according to octogenarian Inasu, who used to perform.
“It is said that George asan’s gurus were trained by one Varu asan. Beyond that none knew about this lineage,” says Thambi Payappilly, another disciple of George and a trainer. Means, beyond the 20th century, the history of the art is bleak.
“There is hardly any support from the State. So, we all are engaged in other work to survive and take up the art only after 7 p.m.,” says a master who prefers to remain anonymous. True. Thambi is an auto rickshaw driver and Roy, a construction labour. Whenever performance opportunities come their way, they stop work and pursue their passion, even if it means a “loss of wages.”
Since 2012, the State Government has included Chavittu-Natakam as one of the items for competition in school youth festivals. And students are slowly but surely taking it up.
Nevertheless, the form and its productions are fast changing. Earlier musical instruments such as Chenda, Ilathalam and Maddalam were used and the actors themselves rendered the verses. During the past few decades, the instruments have been replaced by the tabla, organ, keyboard and the drums. Yes, the pastoral flavour of the music is lost. Old fashioned classy boots have been replaced by canvas shoes and more often than not, the vigour of the stamp (chavittu) is also missing in performances. Of late plays are presented in Malayalam too.
Perhaps, the most significant loss is the disappearance of Kattiyakkaran, an essential character in Chavittu Natakam.
In ancient Tamil, it means the court jester. With humour as his permanent emotion, Kattiyakkaran is the replica of the vidhushak of Koodiyattam except in costume. His funny head-gear and an extremely large belly are his trademarks. Delivering extempore humour and funny imitations of the verses of other characters, are his mandate. He is completely free on stage and may appear and disappear whenever he wants to. Even the King addresses him as comrade (‘Tozhan’).
WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY…
Fr. Joseph Valiyaveetil who has, since 1989, worked for the dissemination of Chavittu Natakam has a different experience to share. To protect the poor fishing community and labour class from the clutches of alcoholism and addiction, he initiated a troupe with rehearsals and performances during the evening hours. “The result was tremendous as the lifestyle of many changed,” beams the priest who produced several social issues through Chavittu Natakam. For the artists and aficionados of Chavittu Natakam, the documentation of the Sangeet Natak Akademi, was a novel experience and came as a boon. “Better late than never,” was the universal response."
Lack of sufficient support system for young alcoholics / addicts rued,Thursday,2014-01-09,TAMIL NADU,[]," Anonymous (AA) Miracle Group that meets once a week, the situation is different.
Though the number from the age group of 17 to 22 attending the AA meetings has increased, it is not so in the case of teenagers.
“The AA meetings are relevant to any age group. The ones who are in the age group of 17 to 22 are more motivated in keeping the initiative going. This was not the case till a few years ago. But the younger ones are controlled by the elders /parents at home. Unless referred by a rehabilitation centre or a doctor, teenagers are not allowed by the elders to attend AA meetings,” the representative laments.
NGOs, JJB and DCPO hope that more adolescent victims receive the right kind of counselling / treatment. But this they believe will be possible only when parents accept their wards condition and are willing to help them come out of it."
Coming out in the open to be an anonymous member,Monday,2014-01-06,TAMIL NADU,[]," Anonymous (AA) who took part in the seventh year anniversary celebrations of the Madurai Inter Group AA at De Nobili Pastoral Centre on Sunday.
The celebrations brought together members of various AA groups in the city which held meetings regularly.
“If two members in a group have abstained from consuming alcohol for more than six months, they can branch out and form a new group where they can interact and talk to people who want to recover from addiction,” a senior AA member said.
AA Madurai has over 1,000 members, led by 70 senior members. They meet every day and discuss ways overcome alcohol addiction and related issues.
“We emphasise on sharing our experiences. When addicts who want to recover come to the meetings, we focus on stabilising emotions and restoring balance,” a member says. “Drinking cannot be stopped individually and it is only through mutual understanding and support that change can be brought about,” he adds.
A senior member said nearly 30 per cent of the members in the city come to AA on their own accord. The rest usually are asked to join and are put on to AA groups from hospitals and treatment centres.
Family members and friends of the recovering alcoholics who are a part of AL ANON groups also took part in the event.
Narrating the importance of having such a group, the wife of an AA member said the group offered her immense support when she was looking for support. “Meetings with family members of the other AA members helped me since I could talk to other people who were facing the same situation as me. I realised that I was not alone and learned to handle the situation more effectively,” she said.
Dr. A. Samuel Dodd from the Grace Kennet Foundation Hospital and Fr. Britto Packiam addressed the AA members and their families and friends in a special session."
There is a way to wean away addicts,Sunday,2013-12-22,OPEN PAGE,[]," who begin with one drink will not be able to stop with just two drinks and would then go on to drink more and more until they start behaving obnoxiously or just simply pass out.
This pattern continues until their existence becomes completely unmanageable in terms of their personal, professional and social life. Ultimately, either they are forced to seek help or their family members and friends strongly urge them to.
And even then the alcoholic will not want to acknowledge that he or she has a problem. This is because the most predominant characteristic of the disease of addiction is DENIAL.
And then begin the excuses leading to a “blame game”. “My wife does not understand me, or, my boss and friends do not understand me,” and, finally, he or she will blame God for giving him/her a raw deal in life when he/she runs are out of excuses.
Unfortunately, the younger generation is also unaware of the perils of addiction — when the pleasure turns into a habit and the habit into addiction. Here we are also talking about behavioural addiction like the Internet, porn, gambling, eating and sex.
Does any of this sound familiar? Now, the good news is that THERE IS A CURE! Addicts need to undergo a complete change in their thinking. This metamorphosis can take place when they are made aware of their problem. Therefore, helping them acknowledge their addiction with the support of a professional and compassionate team. There is also support like Alcoholic Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous where addicts meet others who have managed to come out of their addiction and are leading normal lives.
Once they have undergone initial treatment for their withdrawal, also known as detoxification, from alcohol or drugs, they could try out these support groups. There are Rehabilitation Centres if addicts are not comfortable attending meetings where they are taught how to once again lead normal productive lives following a structured programme. It is rather unfortunate that our society attaches a stigma to all kinds of addictions which, in turn, discourages addicts, making it difficult for them to accept the fact that they have a problem.
I implore all those people out there who lack an understanding of addiction not to deal with the situation on their own as it does not always work that way. The families end up being “enablers” by suppressing and not addressing the issue, inadvertently, encouraging addiction. And therein lies the problem. Help may be closer than you think when you reach out in the right direction.

Held on matricide charge,Tuesday,2013-10-08,KERALA,[],"A 29-year-old man from Kulakkada, near Kottarakara, was arrested by the Kollam Crime Branch CID on Monday on charges of matricide.
The case is unusual in that it was registered by the Crime Branch. Usually, the Crime Branch follows up unsolved cases registered by the local police. This particular case was not registered at any local police station.
Crime Branch Deputy Superintendent of Police C.G. Suresh Kumar who investigated the case gave the name of the arrested man as Manoj Krishnan, alias Manikuttan.
His mother Maniammal was declared dead-on-arrival at the Kulakkada primary health centre (PHC) on April 29, 2012. It passed off as a natural death owing to some ailment. The funeral was held in the compound of Manikuttan’s house, and Maniammal was buried in the presence of a large gathering.
Anonymous letter
However, an anonymous letter sent to authorities six months ago resulted in the Crime Branch registering a case. The copies of the letter were sent to the Chief Justice of the Kerala High Court, the State Women’s Commission, the Inspector-General of Police (Crimes), the District Superintendent of Police (Kollam Rural), and the Superintendent of Police (Crime Branch-Kollam). Mr. Suresh Kumar, who conducted the preliminary inquiry into the case, sent a formal report to Additional Director-General of Police (Crimes) Vinson M. Paul seeking permission to register and investigate the case. After necessary clearance from the government, the case was registered at the Crime Branch headquarters, and Mr. Suresh Kumar entrusted with the investigation.
Vital clue
During the investigation, several persons told Mr. Suresh Kumar that Manikuttan, under the influence of alcohol, assaulted his mother whenever she turned down his demands for money. But the crucial information came from Manikuttan’s wife Sujatha.
Mr. Suresh Kumar said Sujatha told the investigating team that she had allegedly seen her husband asphyxiate Manimmal in a dispute over money. Maniammal who fell unconscious was taken to the PHC by Manikuttan and some neighbours where she was declared dead.
Sujatha also told the investigating team that before attacking Maniammal, her husband had attacked her. She ran out of the house but saw the gruesome scene through the window. Fear preventing her from revealing the truth.
Mr. Suresh Kumar then obtained the permission of the Kollam Revenue Divisional Officer to exhume Maniammal’s body.
Last week, an autopsy was conducted by forensic surgeons from the Government Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram, and experts from the Forensic Science Laboratory. They concluded that the neck cartilages of Maniammal were fractured and fragmented and she was asphyxiated. The autopsy also noted that 10 of her ribs on the right side and seven on the left side were fractured.
Mr. Suresh Kumar said that based on medical evidence and Sujatha’s statement, Manikuttan was taken into custody and interrogated. He then confessed to having committed the murder. Following his arrest, Manikuttan was produced before a magistrate court in the evening and remanded in the district jail."

Helplines in distress,Monday,2013-09-09,KERALA,['10.10 a.m.'],"The chances of women in distress getting on-the-spot assistance from the police helpline numbers seemed to be dim in the capital if the recent experience of a social activist is anything to go by.
At 10.10 a.m. on Wednesday, J. Sandhya of the Human Rights Law Network repeatedly called all the three toll-free helpline numbers for women (9995 399953, 1091, and 0471-233 9953) to help a victim of domestic violence. The numbers were out of order. She called the police control room, which rushed a patrol to the location.
Social activists Aleyamma Vijayan and Rejitha, both prominent members of Sakhi, a resource centre for women, said the lack of functioning of such a crucial public service delivery facility was a matter of import as far as the safety of urban women were concerned.
Both had recently conducted a survey-based study on how safe the capital was for its women residents. They had interviewed a wide cross section of women at public places at different hours of the day.
They said that 98 per cent of the respondents identified sexual harassment in public transport buses, bus stops, and roadsides as the main safety problem they faced. As many as 51 per cent feared potential chain-snatchers (mostly helmeted youth travelling on motorbikes).
Verbal abuse was the most common form of sexual harassment (80 per cent), followed by physical harassment (60 per cent), stalking (26 per cent), and exhibitionism (21 per cent).
The survey also revealed that only 7 per cent of the victims sought police intervention and it was mostly witnesses who informed the law-enforcement. It also noted that 77 per cent of women were loath to approach the police. As many as 38 percent of the respondents felt approaching the police was ‘too tedious.’ The fallout was that women felt insecure when they accessed a wide range of municipal facilities.
The police said domestic violence, obscene calls from anonymous persons, sexual harassment at public places, alcohol-fuelled male violence against women, and dowry harassment topped the list of complaints received at women helplines in the State.
Most such helplines lacked infrastructure, such as police teams and vehicles for quick response, and the phones were dead most of the time due to delay in paying bills. The police personnel attached to such facilities lacked proper training and were not supported by doctors or counsellors.
City Police Commissioner P. Vijayan said he had tried the helpline numbers on his own on Friday and found the complaint of the social activist to be true. He said the issue would be addressed and such helplines would be integrated with the Police Control Room for more rapid police response.
Issue will be addressed: Police Commissioner

An army ‘addicted’ to a social cause,Monday,2013-09-02,TAMIL NADU,[]," Anonymous (AA), an international volunteer body committed to the cause of de-addiction all over the world since 1935.
A few minutes after they gather, the men take turns for the next two hours to narrate their experiences as alcohol addicts, how they joined the AA, how it was helping them overcome the addiction and how life has changed after joining the AA.
Dhanaraj (35) (name changed for anonymity) says he started drinking alcohol from when he was 20-years-old. “I did not spend a day without drinking. I was consistently suspended from my job and was even asked to quit because of my uncontrollable drinking habit. I joined the AA on the advice of one of my friends. As I started attending the daily meetings, I realised that every person addicted to alcohol has the same personality. I was able to identify with every one of them”, he narrates.
Dhanaraj, one of the senior members of the AA has stopped drinking for six years now, and he attends the meetings every day to help the newcomers forsake the drinking habit.
“I earned a decent sum from work, but I spent almost all of it for drinking. I had even sold my bike and my wife’s gold jewels for the sake of drinking. I saved money and built a house after joining the AA”, he recounts.
Even today if he does not attend the AA meetings for four consecutive days he gets the urge to drink, but has kept the habit under check by attending the therapeutic meetings as a ritual, he says.
As Dhanaraj narrates his story, a few more men drip into the meeting taking the count to around 40.
Govindan (50) (name changed for anonymity) is one of the senior most members of the AA. He was addicted to drinking for almost 15-years, but has abandoned the habit for nearly a decade now. “My drinking habit was a cause of embarrassment for my wife and my daughter. I started drinking for fun and soon became addicted to it”, he says.
Govindan then explains to the gathering the difference between restrained drinkers, social drinkers and addicts like him. “All of us who have gathered here are victims of a disease called addiction. People like us cannot stop drinking after tasting it. We need to have self-control”, he says.
The AA meetings were miraculous in his case as his life was resurrected from being on the verge of collapse, Govindan recalls. “When I joined the AA, my wife used to wait outside for me just to ensure that I did not walk away. It then proved to be a miracle. At the time of joining the AA I was drinking heavily as I wanted to die”, he says.
The AA reached Chennai in 1950 and has been effective in Madurai since 2001, says Karmegam (40), another senior member.
“Since 2001 it has benefitted more than 1000 addicts and their families. The concept in the AA is very simple. We ask the members to avoid drinking the next day and then attend the meeting in the evening to tell us how their day was. We ask each member to do this for a minimum of 90 days. The senior members offer them moral support during the 90 days and extend the support to the members who keep in touch with us”, he explains.
According to him, some of the AA’s members are teenagers. “A few students in the high school and higher secondary are brought to the AA by their parents, who say their wards are addicted to consuming shoe polish and whiteners”, he says.
“Some of the newcomers who come to us or are brought to us by their family members are generally in a bad condition. If they have suffered any physical damage because of drinking, we take them to a doctor. In the beginning, until they get accustomed to the regular meetings, we ask them not to talk about their past. We ask them to avoid friends who encourage them to drink. And we insist that they eat properly because hunger is a major factor that leads to drinking”, he told The Hindu .
Janet Sankar, Professor at Madurai Institute of Social Sciences (MISS), says that detoxification needs a multi-disciplinary approach.
“In MISS we organise awareness camps frequently where we insist that the spouse of the addict and the children play a major role in overcoming the addiction. The social stigma attached to the addicts should be changed and the society should realise that they are not criminals but are people suffering from a disease”, she says.
The AA also organises discussion among the spouses of the addicts to ensure prevalence of a supportive ambience at the home as well. “My husband has sold everything from utensils, jewels, bike and my silk sarees for the sake of drinking. I and my children have been beaten on several occasions. When we came to know about the AA, he was in a chronic condition. Today he is more patient at home, helps my children in studies and is not angry as he used to be before. In the meetings for women we discuss as to how we understood what they went through and how to help them overcome it”, says Parvathi (32) (name changed for anonymity).
K.S.P.Janardhan Babu, director (programmes), M.S.Chellamuthu Trust, says, “Two out of ten persons who come to ‘Trishul’, a de-addiction centre run by the trust, are adolescents. Most of the addicts are hesitant to go for de-addiction programmes fearing social stigma”, he concludes.

Says Protection Officer Vasuki, “Women prefer to fight atrocities at home committed especially by their husbands with the Domestic Violence Act 2005 as it promises speedy solutions.”
Between 2008 and December 2012, the Department of Social Welfare received 516 applications. Of these 332 cases were disposed off through counselling and 184 Domestic Incident Reports (DIR) were filed for legal action.
The predominant cause of friction among couple is alcoholism that leads to mental and physical abuse, ego clash and misunderstanding which is further fanned by relatives and third party interference and wrong guidance. “Nowadays dowry demand is not the main reason but certainly it is one of the reasons,” says Vasuki.
As domestic violence is a criminal and non-bailable offence, lawyers and police officials direct women to use the act as a weapon. Aiming to hit back at their wives men prefer to file a divorce case. In most cases, the shock treatment yields results.
Women are forced to withdraw the cases on the pretext that husband would also withdraw the divorce case.
“In present times, individuals are in a hurry. They also lack knowledge about marriage as an institution and the value of it,” says Vasuki and adds “the couple comes into marriage in a hurry and they go out of it at the same pace. They do not have the time to think about children, who are the worst affected.”
The Act provides protection for women not only from physical and sexual abuse but also protects them from other forms of violence such as psychological, verbal and economic abuse.
“There is no age limit for the suffering of women. Even after 10 or 20 years of marriage, women have problems and prefer to file a case under the Domestic Violence Act though they try to give it a dowry harassment angle,” says Ananadavalli, District Social Welfare Officer.
Even if there is any case relating to dowry harassment or divorce pending in court, there is no impediment to file a case under the Domestic Violence Act, she says and adds that anybody can file a complaint on behalf of a woman. The Act stipulates that after filing the DIR intimation should be sent to the husband within three days and a solution found for the complainant within 60 days.
“Nowadays couples use technology to abuse each other,” says Vasuki and notes that both men and women record their emotional outpourings. “They use very abusive language.”
But, the Protection Officer does not take the recordings as evidence. Because, she says that who ever wants to record the speech would use language with caution while instigating the other person.
“Moreover,” she feels “people might record with the help of mimicry artists also. But we can always take cue from these recordings. Howsoever clever, the couple is sure to divulge some important facts that will ascertain who is who.”

Attention-seeking gimmick?
Not everyone thinks of the trend positively, though. Many, like Krish Prashanth of SASTRA University, seem to echo Eleanor Roosevelt’s sentiment ‘small minds discuss people’. “It is a mere attention seeking gimmick; instead of feeling any retribution, people post their wrongdoings anonymously and pride themselves on the likes and comments they receive”, he says. Nachiketa Janardhan of IIT Madras, believes confessions pages are for ‘voyeurs, who are interested in petty gossip’. But Arjun Arul, a student at the Chennai Mathematical Institute, admits, ""It served as comic relief during the exams, though the proposals part is just creepy when not hilarious.""
According to Mansi Thakkar of the National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad, the pages reveal deep anti-woman biases, “Women are talked about cheaply and targeted. Slut shaming is also a disturbing trend.” Sumedh Kapoor, a teacher and parent, adds, “As a parent of a girl, the posts make me concerned about her safety. Many of the posts abuse teachers. The administrator must filter the posts.” But will the moderated confessions have the same effect?
Whether it is plain honesty, a voyeuristic act or sheer escapism, one cannot overlook the storm these confession pages are brewing- if that storm is in a teacup, time alone will tell.

Candidates using liquor to lure voters in Mandya,Saturday,2013-03-02,KARNATAKA,[],"With only a few days left for the urban local body elections in the district, several candidates and their supporters are freely distributing liquor to voters.
Taking serious note of the free flow of liquor, the Excise Department has established seven control rooms across the district to prevent its illegal sale and supply during campaign.
The departmentconducted 149 raids at different places in the district between February 15 and 27 and booked cases against owners of bars and restaurants.
668 candidates
A total of 668 candidates are in poll fray. Among them, 175 candidates are contesting for 35 wards of the Mandya City Municipal Council.
The control rooms have been set up at Mandya, Malavalli, Pandavapura, Maddur, Nagamangala, Srirangapatna and K.R. Pet, a senior official of the Excise Department told The Hindu .
Control room officials are taking complaints of distribution of alcohol to voters during the campaigning for urban local bodies in the district. Besides, the department had set up 218 booth points at different parts of the district.
From February 15 to 27, officials blocked road at 125 places and inspected vehicles, the officer said.
The department also deployed additional staff for patrolling to check illegal distribution and storage of alcohol, besides intensifying inspection at checkposts, the official said.
Excise officials booked 23 cases against several bar and restaurants for violations, another officer said.
“Bar and liquor shop owners are allegedly selling liquor to minors. We have instructed them not to serve liquor to those under the age of 18,” the officer, who wished to remain anonymous, said.
Party agents and supporters were luring voters by illegally distributing liquor, Siddaraju, a social activist, told this correspondent. Agents at several slums were freely distributing liquor to attract voters, he said.
Complaints
The seven control rooms will operate round-the-clock to take complaints of illegal storage or distribution of liquor to voters. The identity of those who provide information will be kept secret. To contact the control room, call 08232-220313/ 225657."

"For the poor, not much to count on....",Sunday,2013-02-10,NEW DELHI,[]," Anonymous which ensures that they do not relapse,” Dr. Rajesh says.
Every inmate who comes to the SPYM centre has to give his consent before he is admitted. Once the inmates come out of detoxification phase, they go through a daily regimen that helps to inculcate discipline and order into their chaotic lives. “The activities at the centre start at seven in the morning and go on until ten at night, when the lights are turned off. The regimen includes meditation, yoga, TV watching, discussions, personalised and group counselling sessions,” says chief counsellor Franklin Lazarus, who himself was a drug and alcohol user for 27 years until he successfully underwent a reformation several years back. “I tell them the problems I underwent with all honesty and they are able to relate to me quickly. They do not realise that what they have is a disease which is curable. But as the treatment progresses they gain confidence that they will recover.”
While alcoholics face a greater chance of relapse, they are prescribed a pill called antiabuse to help them stay off drinking. In the case of drug users, a medicine freely distributed by NACO (National Aids Control Organisation), buprenorphine, is prescribed as part of oral-substitution therapy.
“At the SPYM facility at Kotla Mubarakpur where the density of injected drug users is high, we prescribe buprenorphine, and progressively reduce the dosage. Once the dosage is down to the minimum level, many of them communicate to us that they are ready to come to the rehab,” Dr. Rajesh says.
Nitesh Kumar, a coordinator at SPYM, said the problems at Kotla Mubarakpur, where he estimates the presence of around 800 injection-drug users, centre round the easy availability of over-the-counter drugs from medical shops. “Sometimes they even make deadly cocktails of medical drugs. There is absolutely no monitoring of the problem. We have been motivating the addicted persons to not share syringes as this is causing the spread of HIV among them,” says Nitesh."
Finding a new meaning in their lives,Tuesday,2013-02-05,KARNATAKA,[]," Anonymous (AA) held in different parts of the city on a weekly basis.
In the absence of an organised group of Narcotics Anonymous (NA) as is the case with bigger cities, drug addicts, who want to change for better, are making it a point to attend the AA meetings. A few of those suffering from narcotics dependence syndrome (NDS, strong sometimes overpowering urge to use drugs) have been planning to launch a group of their own so that their recovery is addressed in a better way. A member of the group, which includes a scrap dealer and an advocate and an MSW student, hopes that it could become a reality soon.
It is not all over for a person who is suffering from NDS.
The realisation and acceptance that the person is an addict is the beginning of change, Johnson (name changed), the MSW student, told The Hindu on Monday. Many youngsters unfortunately think they are “infallible” and they can manage it but by the time they realise their folly, it is too late.
Mr. Johnson, who at the height of his addiction, forged the signature to empty his father’s bank balance in Chennai, said that since the fundamental principles of AA and NA were same attending AA meetings had been of great help. Mr. Johnson is getting help from the Fr. Muller’s De-addition Centre, where he also helps other victims.
The changes he brought in his life after an intensive rehabilitation course and association with AA, “which gives unlimited moral support,” he has now “found life, earned respect of peers and (saved) lot of money.”
According to psychiatrist K.K. Shetty, the need is to “manage” the whole family of the drug addict, and a mere 21-day rehabilitation course will not help. This, unfortunately, is not happening here.
Mr. Johnson and de-addiction centre in-charge Shripathi Bhat suggested that more pro-active policing could help prevent supply of drugs. While Mr. Johnson stated that there could be just one or two main suppliers of banned substances, Mr. Bhat said proximity to Goa and Mumbai and increased communication channels could be helping drugs supply, while lifestyle changes and increased disposable incomes were also to blame.
Those in need of help may call AA Inter-group of Dakshina Kannada on 9845013047 or 98458-07190."

Activists working with de-addiction centres say though it is well-known that young women are more frequently seen in pubs there is no documented evidence about how serious the problem is. Doctors say that effect of alcohol in women is more severe and several studies have found that they are linked to cancer of breast if it already runs in the family.

The homemaker, who quit drinking three years ago, said: “I developed the habit of drinking along with my husband about 10 years ago. Our children used to [get upset]. We ended up spending a bulk of our earnings on alcohol. After my husband passed away, I came across this group and realised the pointlessness of drinking.”

“I felt so embarrassed to join any group which can treat my problem as people would come to know about me,” she said.

“Now after recovery I feel just this problem of alcoholism has nothing do with gender, women too can have a problem.

This line of introspection is indeed warranted, for there can be little doubt that these values have fuelled an astonishing number of sexual assaults across India — two women are said to be raped every hour in the country and rapes increased by 20 per cent during 2007-11.
However, less has been said about the need for institutional reforms, especially measures to improve women’s security in public spaces such as university campuses. In most cases Indian college administrators would virtually be starting from scratch in terms of drafting a pragmatic and comprehensive university sexual harassment policy and code of conduct.
Could they look to others, such as universities in the West to get a sense of ‘best practice?’

Sadly, national rape statistics in the U.S., for example, do not inspire confidence. According to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN), one of the nation’s largest anti-sexual violence organisations, 207,754 rapes occur every year, approximately 23 rapes per hour, which is significantly higher than the corresponding figure in India. RAINN adds 54 per cent of sexual assaults are not reported to the police and 97 per cent of rapists never spend a day in jail.
However, the under-reporting of rapes is likely to be high in India, possibly even higher than in the U.S., hence the statistical difference in the number of rapes per se ought not to dissuade policymakers from learning from their U.S. counterparts.
There is little doubt that U.S. universities have a long way to go in terms of making women safe on campus, and indeed 2012 may well be considered “the year of rape” in the U.S. too, in the light of several incidents on college campuses and disturbing remarks about “legitimate rape” and a child born out of rape being “a gift from god,” made by conservative candidates during the election campaign season.
Two such incidents, in particular, are noteworthy and exemplify what is right and wrong with systems to prevent sexual violence on U.S. campuses.
The first, which made national headlines for many months, was the Pennsylvania State University case, in which the former college coach, Jerry Sandusky, was convicted last June on 45 counts of sexual abuse of young boys in his charge.
Besides spotlighting the often overlooked cohort of male victims of sexual violence, the Penn State case stirred up a nationwide discussion on sexual abuse by authority figures in universities. Though Sandusky was indicted in 2011 for child molestation dating from 1994 to 2009, “the abuse may have dated as far back as the 1970s,” according to some reports.
In a more recent case in Stuebenville, Ohio, two high school football players were arrested and charged with raping a 16-year-old girl and “kidnapping her by taking her to several parties while she was too drunk to resist.”
Similar to the assault on a girl on the streets of Guwahati by a gang last July, a video of which went viral on YouTube, graphic photographs emerged in social media, showing the girl looking unresponsive as two boys carry her by her wrists and ankles.
The Stuebenville case highlights U.S. universities’ continuing struggle with sexual violence involving the use of alcohol and drugs to override consent. But it also showed that dysfunctional masculinity often undergirds the proclivity of men to inflict violence upon women, as indeed The Hindu argued is the case in India (‘The rapist in the mirror,’ January 11, 2013). Given the multi-dimensional nature of America’s rape problem it is appropriate, then, that a prevention-focused, multi-stakeholderapproach has been recommended by numerous studies funded by the U.S. Department of Higher Education.
Checklist necessary
Indian universities would do well to begin by ensuring that a basic checklist of campus security mechanisms has been instituted, including but not limited to 24/7 patrolling of the campus by specially-trained security officers; a 24/7 confidential hotline for victims as well as for anonymous tips; access control or building admits and passes restricting entry to authorised persons; escorts made available 24/7 to and from university-owned property from nearby city areas; registration of all motor vehicles parked on campus; keeping campus physical environment safe by managing lighting, vegetation and emergency phone lines; and video surveillance of campus areas deemed risky.
Such core elements designed to provide ongoing security to students would however fail without sufficient institutional coordination, which would include, for example, establishment of a central Public Safety Office at the university whose contact details are widely and regularly disseminated; links between university security apparatus and the local police, and a strategic coordination body including the highest university authorities which would regularly review and refine the campus security strategy.
As an overlay to this institutional “hardware” to ensure security on college campuses, most U.S. universities give significant attention to getting the “software” right – in other words educating the student community on acceptable and illegal conduct towards their peers including in the context of alcohol use. Drug use would almost universally be identified as illegal and entailing severe legal repercussions, as indeed U.S. universities do in their bid to tackle the worryingly widespread problem of date rape. The University of North Colorado has a mandatory two-hour workshop covering these topics, for all incoming freshmen; it screens applicants for sex crimes convictions.
Define offences clearly
In many ways the education of students and staff on unacceptable sexual behaviour and violence stems from the university’s charter code of conduct, which is often a semi-legal document that defines core concepts such as “rape,” “sexual assault,” “sexual harassment” and “consent.” American University in Washington DC , for example, has a detailed definition of consent and argues that it should be “informed and clear,” “essential each time sexual activity occurs,” “granted without perceived threats, intimidation or coercion,” “not construed from a partner’s silence,” “not assumed from previous sexual relationships,” “not implicit in a person’s manner of dress or appearance,” and “not implicit in a person’s acceptance of an invitation for a meal or a date.”
Indian universities would also need to outline the procedure for filing a sexual misconduct complaint, ideally design the process such that it does not burden the potential victim with onerous legal or other responsibilities at the outset. For example anonymity should be guaranteed unless the law requires disclosure of personally identifying information. Legal protection from retaliatory action by the respondent, especially in the case of a student alleging misconduct by a member of staff, should be readily provided. Students should have the right to withdraw a case midway should they desire. Mechanisms should be instituted for victims to report an incident to law enforcement, file a complaint through the university disciplinary process, and opt to prosecute criminally — all as separate actions.
Finally, when rape or sexual assault does occur, university institutions need to make it easy for victims to find support. Victim support groups must consist of trained and experienced staff for medical treatment, trauma counselling and legal advisory. While victims of rape anywhere in the world face social stigma that exacerbates feelings of shame and guilt, this is nowhere truer than in India, where support from even closest family and friends may not be forthcoming. In the U.S. RAINN notes that approximately 66 per cent of assaults are committed by someone known to the victim and 38 per cent of rapists are a friend or acquaintance. With these figures high in India as well, authorities should not shy away from taking a proactive role in victim support.

"“Fear, shame associated with drinking absent”",Monday,2013-01-07,TAMIL NADU,[]," Anonymous Madurai inter-group here, Mr. Balakrishnan said that it was unfortunate that alcoholism, once considered a taboo, had now attained social recognition.
The fear and shame associated with drinking were absent now and people had started to drink even in their teens. There was a recent instance of two tenth standard boys getting drunk in a nearby IMFL outlet during school hours. When this was brought to the notice of the police, action was initiated against salesman of the IMFL outlet for selling liquor to minors. Mr. Balakrishnan said that people started to drink out of curiosity or a false belief that it would ‘feel good.’ They did not realise that a small-time pleasure would ultimately end up in long-term pain. The all-women police stations in the district had united over 2000 families that had cases of marital disharmony in 2012. Over 75 per cent of such cases were caused by alcoholism. The Madurai district police would utilise the services of AA in rehabilitating alcoholics involved in cases of marital disharmony. The AA would be help to sustain harmony in families united through conciliatory talks in all-women police stations. He praised the role of AA in bringing about a silent revolution in society.
K.S.P. Janardhan Babu, Assistant Director, M.S. Chellamuthu Trust and Research Foundation, hailed the role played by women in a family in getting alcoholic men rehabilitated through AA. AA members from all over the State shared their experience."

Ramasubramanian, State Nodal Officer of Mental Health Programme in Madurai Medical College are expected to deliver addresses."
Exposing a multidecade smuggling operation,Sunday,2012-11-11,NATIONAL,[],"In February 2007, authorities in Mumbai detained a consignment heading to the Nimbus Import-Export Corporation in the U.S. The customs declaration said it contained “marble garden table sets.” However, when the consignment was stopped, they found that it contained Chola period idols, some valued in multiple-millions of dollars, and seven crates were seized.
While an analysis of databases revealed that one consignment had already been shipped out to the U.S. a week or so prior to the seizure, Indian authorities alerted their U.S. counterparts immediately and, as a result, the same month the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) seized the consignment.
It was ultimately to be delivered safely into the hands of the alleged kingpin of one of the most “successful” smuggling rings in the history of the Indian subcontinent — Subhash Chandra Kapoor.
Kapoor, who is said to hail from a multi-decade family history of plundering cultural institutions across South and South East Asia, had apparently made a rare mistake. Instead of having the consignment, which, ICE said in a public statement, was worth over $20 million, sent to intermediaries in Singapore, London and elsewhere as per standard operating procedure, Kapoor was said to have committed the error of having it directly sent to him from India.
When ICE pounced on the consignment and brought Kapoor in for questioning, he apparently acknowledged being aware of the laws governing importation of cultural properties from India, and the fact that shipment could not be lawfully imported. Therefore, he elected to abandon the items.
But the confidence that he inherited from his father, who is said to have similarly looted temples and other institutions in India, Pakistan and Nepal even since the 1960s, may have imbued him with a false sense of security.
Suggesting that Kapoor had failed to heed the warning of ICE’s seizure in 2007, a cooperating defendant reportedly said Kapoor was still looking for fresh artefacts between April 2008 and October 2011. At that time, an anonymous letter was also sent to Homeland Security Investigations in New York (HSI/NY) giving detailed information on Kapoor and his illicit cultural property activities.
Although he was said to have ultimately fled the U.S. before ICE could tighten the noose around his operations and arrest him, Indian authorities’ coordination with their counterparts abroad led to an Interpol ‘Red Corner’ notice against Kapoor for smuggling, and he wound up in a Chennai prison.
While Kapoor was subsequently said to have implicated others in his network of smugglers, including his brother, son and daughter, much of the evidence against him remains in the U.S., it has become evident. For example, during questioning, ICE recorded admissions by members of the group of dealing in looted property, confessions of manufacturing false provenance, documented proof, and seized smuggled shipments at port — all part of a meticulous effort to tie the Kapoor firmly to his operations.
Fate of stolen idols
Since the time of his questioning and subsequent arrest, Indian authorities are said to have mapped out the entire alleged chain of operations by Kapoor, Asokan and other associates in Tamil Nadu, from the actual theft of the idols from individual temples to their delivery to galleries in the U.S. and elsewhere. Crucial to this process has been the input of officers from the Criminal Investigation Department, Idols Wing, in Tamil Nadu.
This mapping may be of use in speeding up investigation into the theft of Tamil Nadu idols, currently in the possession of ICE. However, a similar exercise would be necessary for other parts of India from which Kapoor is said to have stolen idols, and this may require further coordination with State-level authorities as appropriate.
Gang bosses and
their methods
The role of Sanjivi Asokan, whose links to Kapoor have reportedly been confirmed by authorities, is highly pertinent to this case for, he is said to be the leader of Kapoor’s gang of robbers. Asokan is under arrest following action by the Tamil Nadu CID.
The most commonly practised method of theft by Asokan’s gang was outright robbery, which would likely entail breaking and entering, followed by forced removal while seeking to avoid detection, it has been suggested. However, in numerous instances, authorities are said to have recorded the use of bribery, including through the offer of alcohol.
Another player who is said to be a key associate of Kapoor is London-based Kishore Bhatt. Bhatt is mentioned in a seizure report from 2009 by Mumbai authorities, which mentioned the recovery of Shiva-Parvati black sandstone idols from the 15th Century Pal period, said to be worth Rs. 2.5 crore (they are now in the Customs Museum in Goa). In this case, a bogus export address was apparently provided and so neither Bhatt nor Kapoor could be traced after the seizure.
Bhatt was also said to be a known hashish smuggler who has been on Indian authorities’ radar for over 15 years, and has been arrested in the past. Although Bhatt is said to remain a free man in London, it is possible that he may find the noose tightening around his operations too, as cooperative efforts between Indian and U.K. intelligence gain momentum.
In terms of his area of expertise, Bhatt is considered a specialist in idols from India’s eastern States. Together, Kapoor’s Indian and international associates are said to be active in India, Nepal and Pakistan.
ICE and the road ahead
With regards to the process for the return of the high-value idols, there is said to be good and bad news for the many anxious temple trustees and worshippers across Tamil Nadu.
While the idols seized are still in the possession of ICE, the Indian authorities are said to have begun filing claims for the repatriation of those idols that are confirmed to be from India. Four claims have reportedly been filed already, with many more on the way as the investigation unfolds.
In many cases the idols are already placed in major museums across the U.S.; however, these museums will be under obligation to return them to India once their origin is formally established, it is understood. ICE will apparently seek to enforce a law according to which any idol that is shown, even retrospectively, to have been procured by fraudulent or illicit means will have to be returned to its original source.
The downside of this process is that ICE is said to be preparing its prosecution case against Kapoor and his alleged associates, and only after the case has been completed will it be possible to return the idols as appropriate. Until such time the idols are said to be held at a facility only known as “the fortress,” where a large number of idols from other countries are also currently being held."
Information matters,Monday,2012-11-05,FEATURES,[],"Not sure if one should kiss on the first date? Wondering what to do on the first night? Now information about sex and relationships is only a click away. Love Matters, a mobile website hosted by Radio Netherlands Worldwide in partnership with DKT condoms, claims to have all the answers.
“Thirty thousand people search ‘How to kiss’ every day on Google! So there’s a real need to get that kind of information out there,” said Michele Ernsting, head of Love Matters. The website works on the premise that the sexual and reproductive decisions made by today’s youth will have great impact on their personal lives and on society.
“The site is not raunchy, it is informative and being anonymous helps in more sharing, leading to better sex lives,” said 21-year-old Josy Stevens (name changed), an engineering student.
Targeting the website towards India, where sex is still a taboo subject, has not been a cake walk. Love Matters provides easy to access information and news on everything related to sex to a young audience around the world.
The team had to face many hurdles while building the Hindi website (www.lovematters.in). “We had to coin a term for female masturbation. There was no way of saying it in Hindi! We have to wade through a lot of cultural barriers,” says Ms. Ernsting.
People post blogs and queries which are answered by ‘Auntyji’, an expert on sexual health and sexuality. She represents a motherly figure guiding the young generation. “I have myself posted many times and the best part is the simple framework of the site. Also, Sex A-Z is like a youth encyclopaedia encompassing a wide range of topics— from alcohol to pornography and from erection to virginity,” said 22-year-old Rajvi Desai, a student in a business school.
“At Love Matters, we are glad to be friends with DKT because we think they do a great job at making sure everyone has access to birth control and safer sex at a price they can afford. So people can make choices about their lives,” says Vithika Yadav, head of Love Matters India operations.
The website has gone viral in India and there are now plans of launching editions in Africa, Middle East and China."

Rashmi enjoys cooking as much as writing. “My job is to write for the average diner, to recreate an experience accurately, and to tell the diner what to expect.”
As a matter of principle, Rashmi always pays for her meals. “I make sure I go many times and take people along to get different palette opinions. I book the table anonymously and send my guests ahead so that they can order and nothing can be tampered with.”

Rashmi swims for 45 minutes everyday to keep fit.

I made several trips to France over two years, spent my life savings on this project and have listed about 300 restaurants which offer cheap, fabulous, crisp, French meals for vegetarians, to the most expensive meals you can have.”
“I hired a car and was chauffeured around by a baron who was in bad times, but he knew all the local places and facts.

We went to a restaurant called The Pink Flamingo and a vegetarian specialty there is a pizza called La Gandhi, and for some reason it’s got baba ganoush, saag paneer and mozzarella topping,” she laughs.
“Do you like Hemingway?” she asks. “I love Hemingway!” she tells me and without pause she narrates an anecdote about Bar Hemingway on Rue Cambon in Paris. “Hemingway was an alcoholic and he used to frequent this bar and one day he went to the bartender and asked him to mix him a drink that bloody Mary couldn’t smell on his breath – Mary was his third or probably fourth wife and that’s the story behind the cocktail.”

Did she? Didn’t she?,Thursday,2012-07-19,METRO PLUS,[],"Psychologist Carl Jung said “Every form of addiction is bad, no matter whether the narcotic be alcohol or morphine or idealism.” Had he lived in the present day, he might have wanted to add ‘social media’ to that list of addictives!
According to a research conducted by Salford Business School at the University of Salford in UK, popular social networking sites feed anxiety and can make people feel insecure. A survey of hundreds of social network site users found that more than half of them admitted that the sites have changed their behaviour, and half of them said their lives had been altered for the worse. The study also demonstrated the addictive powers of the Internet, with 55 per cent of people saying they felt “worried or uncomfortable” when they could not access their Facebook or email accounts.
Concurring with the findings of this research, collegian Trisha Reynolds says: “Every time I upload a display picture, I get nervous about the number of ‘likes’ my picture is getting. I keep refreshing my Facebook page to check on it.”
Misha Roy, a software professional, says: “I panic when my Internet connection on my phone is lost. It’s quite paralysing and smart phones have a lot to do with our addiction to networking sites.”
The research also states that those who suffered a negative impact from social media said their confidence fell after comparing their own achievements to those of friends online. Two-thirds said they found it hard to relax completely or to sleep after spending time on the sites, while one quarter of them said they had been left facing difficulties in their relationships or workplace after becoming confrontational online.
“I used get intimidated when results were announced and my friends would post their marks on Facebook and now that we’re all looking out for jobs, when one of my friends lands a good job and Tweets about it, it makes me feel rather depressed,” states Yash Kapadia, a management graduate.
To combat the anxiety that comes with addiction, several people have hopped off social networking sites. “My productivity at work dropped drastically and so did my social skills. Now that I’m not preoccupied with Tweeting and updating my status, I have more time to work, interact personally with people, and I don’t end up going to bed late,” says Ashok Raman, a marketing executive.
Too much of anything is bad. Psychologist Shruthi Ahluwalia says: “In a time and age like this, most people are stressed out and are predisposed to anxiety. Anxiety can result from just about anything, including technology. Social networking is addictive and addiction brings with it anxiety. De-addiction on the other hand, brings with it withdrawal symptoms. Therefore, a report like this doesn’t come as a surprise. Nonetheless, with any stressful situation at hand, the body’s defence mechanisms start working.”
The same is true of people who are insecure due to social networking sites and who are supposedly switching off their gadgets of communication every now and then to reduce the tension.
With Facebook, Twitter and other such websites becoming as addictive as other tranquilisers, therapy might be a necessary intervention.
Who knows, we might just all be flocking to Social Networking Anonymous meetings in the near future!

The ‘highs’ and ‘lows’ of addiction,Tuesday,2012-07-03,KARNATAKA,[],"It’s an abysmal low that takes away more than the ‘ultimate high’ can ever give. This was the message given to those gathered at the one-day workshop on “Advocacy of drug abuse prevention” held at Prajna Counselling Centre here on Monday.
In the sessions that were devoid of district-level officials, all of whom backed out from participating in the programme, it was the stories of ex-addicts that lucidly illustrated the ill-effects of drug abuse.
William (name changed) said his journey into Corex (a cough syrup) addiction started when he was a law student. “You start off by thinking that what affects everyone else cannot affect you. As an educated person, I started seeing it as something ‘progressive’ people do,” he said.
What he called the “ultimate high” after the first bottle he consumed, soon turned into 11 bottles a day with lesser highs. “I had to have a bottle just to feel normal,” he said and added that during the four-year period of addiction, he was transformed from a school topper to someone who fared badly in law examinations.
His descent ultimately affected his heart. In 2007, after he was found having multiple blocks in his heart, he joined Narcotics Anonymous – a therapeutic group for addicts by ex-addict. Since then, he says he hasn’t looked back.
For Suresh (name changed), alcoholism came despite seeing it ravage his abusive uncle. However, through a series of reasons – including loneliness at staying away from his family, pressures of the job, and even the weather – he took to the bottle. In the 10-year period of heavy drinking, which also involved an accident – “I was drunk and blacked out. I don’t recall how the accident happened. All I know is that I woke up three days later in the hospital,” he said – his family had been reduced to penury. “I was the only earning member and I had spent it all on alcohol,” he said.
Eventually, he was forced into Prajna counselling centre for rehabilitation. Nearly 20 years later, he says he lives to tell the tale to a whole new generation of people.
Younger and younger
The workshop, organised in association with Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India, sought to highlight the dangers of substance abuse.
Hilda Rayappan of the Prajna Counselling Centre said the demographic of addicts coming to the centre was getting younger. “Children now do marijuana, alcohol, sniff whitener, and other substances. It starts because their peers do it, or they steal drinks from their parents,” she said and added that being hooked to a mobile or the television could be considered addiction among the younger generation.
Debunking the myth of women not being addicts, she said: “In the district, there is a greater chance that a woman ends up being an alcoholic. It is tradition here to give her alcohol for 40 days after delivery of her child, and also, here it is generally the women who prepare local toddy,” Ms. Rayappan said."

Slew of programmes against drug abuse,Wednesday,2012-06-27,KERALA,[]," Anonymous, Kozhikode.
P.N. Suresh Kumar, joint convener of the IMA State committee for Mental Health, delivered the keynote address.
The anti-drug abuse campus club of the Kerala Lahari Virudha Vedi was inaugurated by District Collector K.V. Mohankumar at a programme at Holy Cross College. It is supported by the Prashanthi de-addiction centre.
Our Responsibility to Children (ORC) joined hands with IMHANS to organise a programme at the new bus-stand in the city. It was inaugurated by City Police Commissioner Sparjan Kumar. He administered an anti-addiction oath.
The school theatre of Government Boys’ Higher Secondary School and the PTA of the school presented a street play.
The Department of Excise, in association with the Milieu Institutional Psychotherapy Centre, presented a play against drug abuse at CMC Boys’ High School, Elathur. A film show against addiction was organised at BEM Upper Primary School, Bilathikulam.
District Collector K.V. Mohan Kumar flagged off a mass run by the Student Police Cadets from the New Bus Stand to Mananchira.
Awareness class, poster competition, poster exhibition, CD exhibition, and street plays were part of the day’s programmes at Rahmania Higher Secondary School for the Handicapped.
The Muslim Service Society Youth Wing and the Sarangi School of Music organised awareness programmes and poster exhibition.
A school-level vigilance committee against drugs was inaugurated at a programme organised at Government TTI. Essay and painting competitions for students were also held."
"20,000 alcoholics in Kerala need urgent help",Saturday,2012-05-05,KERALA,[]," Anonymous, a global front that works among alcoholics, has said.
The anti-alcoholism group is celebrating the 55th anniversary of its presence in Kerala at Feroke Grama Panchayat Community Hall on Saturday. The group came to the State in the 1960s but has been active only since the last 20 years.
Now, there are 200 groups in Kerala, 12 inter-groups and a state committee. Disclosing the data about the number of alcoholics in Kerala needing urgent attention, the AA says even medicine cannot at times help to overcome the desire to consume alcohol but the 12- point life style proposed by the forum could help to go on without alcohol for a long time.
Contact
The formula of AA includes sharing experiences, strengths and ambitions among fellow alcoholics to find solution to the problems. Those interested in availing themselves of AA's help could contact the forum at 8590240240 or 9349610022."
Game changer,Thursday,2012-04-26,METRO PLUS,[],"Really, this is a beautiful story. How a man chases his love for rolling out cocktails to friends and ends up mass-producing ready-to-drink blends, giving many of us a much-needed option to hold a fabulous desi-made cocktail at last.
Mumbai-native Desmond Nazareth is an alumnus of IIT, Madras, and lived the dream of a software professional in the land of Uncle Sam for 18 years. In 2000, he returned home, to friends who gave him the post of their designated cocktail maker, because he liked it. He went from store to store looking for liqueurs. Some he got, some not. But what he got turned out to be super pricey.
That led him to the invention of some classy, home-grown Margaritas and cocktail bases. The idea came when he was looking for a bottle of Tequila, “I thought, why is Tequila produced in just one country (Mexico) whereas other equally popular alcoholic beverages have multiple producers in multiple countries?”
Research soon led Desmond to his “aha” moment. “I saw photos of the blue Agave used in Mexico for Tequila and was sure I had seen similar plants growing in India during my childhood.” On tracing the latitude lines in a world map for the Agave growing regions, he found, “They crossed right through the Deccan Plateau!”
Desmond continued to dig for the next few years and collected enough information before landing up in Goa “to meet the right people” with whom he set off on a trip to the Deccan. “I carried with me all my data files and lo and behold, we found the blue-green Agave!” he recalls.
This discovery changed Desmond — from being a number in the software industry to someone whose enterprise led to the creation of DesmondJi, the brand he named to produce ready-to-drink Margarita, Blue Margarita, 100% Agave and 51% Agave. Don't miss the suffix ‘Ji' in his brand name. This is “to underline the use of Indian raw materials and technical ingenuity.” It is also to match the likes of international brands Johnnie Walker, Chivas, Jack Daniel's, Smirnov, etc., named after their founders. “However since the 1900s, innovation in spirits and liqueurs has become largely corporatised, with products mainly being created by anonymous groups of people in laboratories. So it has been a while since there has been any personal name branding in the alcoholic beverage space, especially in India. So DesmondJi is a bold departure for a start-up like ours, in which my first name ‘Desmond' speaks to a truth behind the brand,” he explains.
DesmondJi has a micro-distillery site in rural Andhra Pradesh and a bottling unit in Goa. Currently, the products are available only in Goa and Daman. Self distribution has been an uphill task. “Whether you sell only thousand bottles or one million, the Excise rules are the same. For every brand to enter the Delhi market, we have to shell out Rs. 6 lakhs per year.” Though through word of mouth, some business houses have pumped in money into it. Desmond says, “We will soon be available in Maharashtra and may be Karnataka.” About the difference between Tequila and his Agaves, Desmond clarifies, “Tequila and Mezcal are Geographical Indications in Mexico owned by their Government. This means that only Agave spirits produced from specific species of Agave grown in specified regions of Mexico and governed by specific rules can be called Tequilas and Mezcals. Our Agave spirits are made from the species that grows on the Deccan Plateau and has been planted in India for well over a hundred years.”
Desmond's Margarita blends need only lime and ice, and are easy to make at home and in bars. Each 750 ml bottle for Rs. 495 makes 15 Margaritas. “You can also add fruits juices, ideally fresh, to our blends and even add tender coconut, sugarcane and cucumber juice.” The Agave blends “are great for shots and making cocktails.”
Talking about his enterprise, Desmond says, “From custom designing the equipment, buildings, the bottles; from training the staff to fighting the system, I have gone through all. I have also gained friends in the process. Rest I shall talk in my autobiography!”

Big brothers and sisters,Saturday,2012-04-14,METRO PLUS,[],"Zipping down the Beach Road on their motorbikes, feverishly tweeting and texting, or gossiping over soft drinks at multiplexes — if this is the image you have of today's youth, remember there is also a flip side. Many young people are creative, knowledgeable and keen to do something for society.
The Hindu Metro Plus team recently met about 100 students from various degree and professional colleges who have taken up the onerous task of eradicating child begging. The students have joined an organisation called Generation YUVAA (Youth Unearthing Verve and Aspirations), floated by B. Naresh Kumar, a biotechnology engineer from a leading college. He founded the organisation immediately after passing out in 2007, with the idea of doing something for the less privileged children of the city. He overlooked lucrative offers to take up this task full time.
Taking a cue from Tagore's famous song ‘Jodi Tor Daak Shune Keu Na Ase Tobe Ekla Chalo Re', Naresh started off alone and within three months about 30 students from various colleges joined him. “Today, we have about 1,500 volunteers, out of which over 150 of them are very active,” he says.
Their slogan is very simple: “Your coin can ruin someone's life.” The basic idea is to eradicate child begging by discouraging people from supporting it. Every Sunday or on public holidays volunteers hold up placards and distribute pamphlets at major traffic junctions such as NAD Kotha Road, Satyam Junction and Beach Road to create awareness on the issue.
It is estimated that there are 150 million to 200 million street children across the globe and India heads the list. An officer from the Government Children Home for Boys, who chose to speak anonymously, says this city itself could have about 1,500 street children begging at the railway station, bus stations, traffic junctions, Kancharapalem flyover and other locations, or employed in various hazardous professions.
Solomon George, a recent graduate from an engineering college and Treasurer of Generation YUVAA, says that when we give a coin to a child beggar we encourage him to continue the profession and thereby curtail his growth.
He adds that most of these children are either orphans or are trafficked children. “They hail from the BPL segment and have taken up begging, as money flows in easily without any effort. By taking up begging for a couple of hours, they earn more than Rs. 300 a day. Most of them are addicted to the sniffing of whitener eraser fluids or alcohol or some form of drugs,” he says.
The team of volunteers not only try to bring awareness, but also counsel the children and send them to children's homes or to their own respective homes, to wean them from begging. They play games with the children, organise cultural programmes or quizzes for them, and teach them.
“Every Sunday we visit a children's home to spend some time with them,” says Bharghav, an engineering student and volunteer. “Education is the key factor by which we can wean them from such professions and habits. We try to impart quality and holistic education. Apart from the daily academic stuff, we teach other aspects of life and how to become a good citizen and good human being,” he says.
The ultimate mission of YUVAA is to own a full-fledged home for street children. To begin with they have adopted two children, Ganesh and Ashok. Ganesh is an orphan, and Ashok has lost his father. Both about five years old, they live at the home provided by team YUVAA at Marripalem. For the children the volunteers are ‘annas and akkas' (brothers and sisters).
“We believe in bringing up the children with love and affection,” says Naresh. “We do not want them to miss their parents. In most of the government homes, the elements of love and affection are missing.”
“We have procured land near Pendurthi and we intend to set up a home that can house at least 150 children,” he adds. Naresh has also initiated a handicraft showroom called Green House. The profits are diverted into the organisation to run the show.
Apart from acute poverty, many of these children are driven to the streets by broken families, abuse at home, fear of studying in government schools, trafficking and illicit connections of the parents.
“We not only counsel the children but also the parents, and urge them not to discontinue the child's education, as we believe that education is the only panacea for upliftment of these children and the society at large,” says Lakshmi, a volunteer.
While Ganesh and Ashok have found a home and a huge team of loving brothers and sisters, there are many who await such a gesture. “If 10 per cent of the youth think of doing something for society,” says Naresh, “there will be a sea change.”"
Public address system for NGO to eradicate alcoholism,Saturday,2012-04-07,TAMIL NADU,[],"Public address system has been given to the Alcoholic Anonymous organisation, which works to eradicate alcoholism habit from society.
Supply of the public address system to the Ngo by the district administration and the police is to help the organisation widen their activities to counter alcoholism.
District administration and police are working in tandem with the organisation to create awareness among the public on the evils of illicit liquor and methanol.
The public address system was donated as part of the programme, a release from the district police here said. District Collector R. Lilly distributed the public address system and also awareness posters on the side-effects of alcoholism at the Collectorate recently.
P. Saravanan, Additional Superintendent of Police of the Prohibition and Enforcement Wing (PEW) of the district police, and other officials accompanied the collector on the occasion, the release added."
Alcoholics Anonymous to hold meetings,Monday,2012-01-23,TAMIL NADU,[]," Anonymous along with its subsidiary group, the AA (Al-Anon) comprising family members of alcoholics who quit alcohol, is planning to arrange a series of interactive meetings in the coming days in which people addicted to alcohol would be enthused to quit by telling them the stories of AA members.
Srinivas, now an active AA group member, narrated to this paper on the sidelines of the inaugural function how an accidental contact with AA movement helped him quit drinking alcohol in 1993 after an addiction for 13 years prior to it.
“I lost 11 jobs in 13 years due to my drinking habit and even became a ‘social outcast' before I ‘started living' again thanks to the AA,” he said.
Those interested could contact AA public information committee (Tel: 99447-07445) to know details of the itinerary of meetings."
Students most vulnerable,Tuesday,2011-12-27,ANDHRA PRADESH,[]," Anonymous centres in the city and every centre has over 20 members, who are trying to recover from the ill effects of drugs. There are many other centres that are operated by other organisations.
It mostly begins at the college level. Though most youngsters from high income groups are getting habituated, those from middle income groups are slowly following suit, he explains. “It is not just students and other professionals, a few from film industry, particularly upcoming artists are also into this menace. A film actor joined us but did not stay for long. Most members inform that they get drugs from foreigners and other agents from Banjara Hills, Dhoolpet, Secunderabad Railway station, Tolichowki and other areas,” says Mr. Shekhar.
The organisation follows a 12-step programme as part of the rehabilitation and all those, who follow the programme, can come out of the habit. Apart from this, all the members are counselled regularly and are provided physical and mental rehabilitation, he says. In the initial days, most members find it difficult and do not open up freely. But after talking to other members and sharing their experiences, they get some confidence and recover fast, he adds. He can be contacted on 98480-58625"
"50-year-old woman, son arrested for murder",Tuesday,2011-12-13,TAMIL NADU,[],"Jaderpalayam police arrested E. Manimegalai (50) and her son E. Ilavarasan (23), of Sakthi Nagar in Sirukinathupalayam Village near Kabilarmalai in Paramathi-Velur Taluk, for allegedly murdering N. Ettikan (60), her husband, during the late hours of Sunday.
According to police, Ettikan, a daily wage labourer, was an alcoholic. On Sunday morning, Ettikan quarrelled with his wife and son. The same night Ilavarasan reportedly hit his father with an iron rod, killing him on the spot.
Ilavarasan and Manimegalai informed their relatives that Etikkan died of a heart attack and they cremated the body at the Sirukinathupalayam crematorium close to midnight on Sunday.
The issue came to light on Monday when Jaderpalayam Police received an anonymous call stating that Ettikan was murdered.
Bbased on a complaint from the Village Administrative Officer, the police searched the house and recovered the blood stained rod. Later, the mother and son reportedly confessed to the crime.
Police personnel said that the nature of injuries could not be confirmed as the body was completely burnt.
The two were booked under sections 302 (murder) and 201 (for destroying evidence) of the Indian Penal Code. They were arrested and produced before the Paramathi Judicial Magistrate and remanded at the Salem Prison."
Raid reveals ‘permanent' residents of guest houses,Wednesday,2011-11-16,KERALA,[],"The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) on Tuesday conducted surprise inspections at 65 government and Public Works Department (PWD) guest houses across the State and said it detected several grave irregularities, including illegal overstay of unauthorised guests.
VACB director-in-charge N. Sankar Reddy ordered the raids code-named “Operation Adithi”. Investigators said some people had appropriated government guest house rooms “permanently”.
A classic case they detected was that of a “self-proclaimed” anti-corruption and human rights campaigner who had a permanent room in a Kochi guest house. The same person had similarly “appropriated” a room at a guest house in the capital, they said.
Investigators, who questioned the staff, said some of them were afraid that the “campaigner” would send anonymous petitions against them to their higher-ups if they denied him the rooms. A wholesale dealer trading electric appliances and crockery had “permanently” converted a guest house room as his office and store.
The VACB said it would recommend to the government to exact rent arrears from such law breakers at “penal” rates for their “unauthorised” stay.
In a guest house in Irinjalakuda in Thrissur district, the agency found that Rs.11,000 remitted as rent by a visiting National School of Drama troupe had not been entered in the register or deposited in the treasury, despite the receptionist handing them a receipt for their payment.
Further enquiry revealed that the staff had appropriated the money by issuing the receipt, but only after ensuring that no carbon copy of it remained in the original bill book. Investigators said that in most rest houses, crockery and bed-spreads bought under the pretext of VIP visits, were pilfered after a single use. The managers of such establishments rarely maintained an inventory of such items. The VACB said that most of guest houses lacked proper house keeping. Many had leaky plumbing, poor electrical works, and rooms infested with cockroaches, bed bugs and rats. Towels and bed spreads given to guests were most often “used and old ones”.
Most guest house managements rarely kept a record of the hours they operated power generators, despite purchasing not less than 500 litres of diesel on most months as generator fuel. The VACB said it found that several managers rented out rooms to guests, often without any record and for short periods, to consume alcohol and hold parties.
‘Canteen owner'
They said the relative of a guest house manager operated a full fledged public canteen in the facility, without government sanction. All his overhead expenses, including power and water, were inadvertently met by the government. Investigators said room rent collected from guests was rarely deposited in treasuries."
This phony game calls for strict action,Thursday,2011-11-10,TAMIL NADU,[],"Sitting inside the dim-lit halls of the 108 Emergency Response Services' call centre in Triplicane, 24-year-old T.Vairamani received a call about a fortnight ago from a little girl who she would later on describe as someone with a “child-like voice”. The girl said her grandmother had died. There was complete silence for the next three seconds.
Even as Ms.Vairamani was preparing to alert an ambulance to triangulate the girl's position and rush to the spot, the voice on the phone laughed heartily and disconnected the call. The girl would call more than a 100 times that day and repeat exactly what she did the first time.
Such nuisance or prank calls have become so common that many of the anonymous voices even have their own nicknames – like Cuddalore Selvam or social service Mariappan. Of the 25,000 medical emergency calls that the toll-free 108 helpline receives from across the State each day, nearly 85 per cent are categorised as “unproductive”.
Children are responsible for the maximum number of nuisance calls, accounting for over two lakh calls in just the last six months. “When school holidays are announced, we go on alert,” says Ms.Vairamani. She has been on the job for two years and she still remembers the first abusive call that she got. “I cried on the floor that day. I guess some men feel powerful when they get to abuse a woman. Drunken persons are especially difficult to handle,” she says.
While most of the abusive calls come from rural areas, the educated urban populace resorts to bomb threats, says Ms.Vairamani, containing a smile.
“The most dangerous and merciless are the hoax calls,” says B. Prabhudoss, regional manager of EMRI, which operates the 108 ambulance service.
All emergency calls received by 108 are passed on to an ambulance. The paramedic in the ambulance then keeps in touch with the caller and if required, gives advice on how to administer first-aid. Hoax callers direct the ambulance towards a false emergency. P.Chandrasekar, an emergency medical technician with the 108 ambulance service, says: “Many times, I have responded to calls about a man or woman fainting on the Marina beach. Initially, the caller would give vague directions and then switch off the phone.” Such calls keeps the ambulance busy instead of it being used for a genuine emergency.
Many repeat callers have been cornered by 108 personnel, but no one admits to the crime. “When we take a list of numbers to the police, they say even their control room number ‘100' gets about 600 prank calls a day,” says Mr. Prabhudoss.
Number portability and other factors have made it difficult to trace every single caller. As a result, even temporary helplines such as the one set up by the Chennai Corporation last month ahead of the civic polls are targeted. “In the long run, we need a regulatory framework to set up mobile phone tracking systems such as the one that 911 [in the US] has,” he says.
For now, in response to a record 1,473 calls made on a single day by a person from Cuddalore, EMRI has set up a system that blocks more than five calls from the same number in a day. “But it is temporary,” Mr.Prabhudoss says. “The number is released within three days. Some of the callers are psychologically depressed or alcoholics. But even they or their family members might face a genuine emergency. It is unfair to block anyone.”"

Alcoholics Anonymous meet in city,Sunday,2011-10-02,ANDHRA PRADESH,[]," Anonymous met at the Siddhartha Public School campus on Saturday as part of the organisation's silver jubilee celebrations.
The organisation provides a platform to those addicted to alcohol, to share their addiction-induced miseries and find out new ways to overcome it.
The members like to be anonymous to the world but believe in collectively battling out the ‘disease' afflicted to them and eating out into the vitals of their systems."
The village doctor,Friday,2011-07-22,METRO PLUS,[],"T he bus drops me off at a dusty road in Thennamanallur. The village seems empty, except for two elderly women standing by a shop near the bus stand. I approach them for directions. “Could you tell me where I can find Dr. Meera of Chinmaya Organisation?” They appear clueless. “The doctor's clinic?” I repeat. “Oh! Yes, doctor! You can find her at the next turn,” says one of them.
Not everybody in Thennamanallur knows her name or where she's from. But they're sure of one thing — ‘doctor' is someone they can turn to, no matter what. There is only one clinic in the village. There are no crowded waiting rooms. A Ganesha statue stands at the centre. There is a blackboard in one corner with benches facing it. Kids play carrom in an open courtyard. Meera Krishna sits at a table overlooking the courtyard.
She is the project coordinator for the Siruvani branch of Chinmaya Organisation for Rural Development (CORD). A few years ago, illiteracy, poverty and alcoholism prevented development of any kind at Thennamanallur. Most houses did not have toilets. Women rarely stepped out of their homes. But things changed once Meera set up a CORD office in the village.
“I've always wanted to serve in a rural set-up,” says Meera. “After 16 years of practice in Chennai, we moved to Coimbatore for my daughter's education. She studied at the Chinmaya International Residential School in Siruvani.” Meera passed by Thennamanallur whenever she visited her daughter. She thought it was a perfect place for her clinic. “I volunteered here for a year,” she says, till CORD identified her in 2006.
Bringing people together
Meera has been on her toes ever since. “At CORD, we empower the rural population by integrated and sustainable development,” she explains. It's all about bringing people together. Self Help Groups (SHGs), magalir mandrams and farmers' clubs have been formed. “While we work with other panchayats, Thennamanallur is our focus. So far, we have 19 SHGs and three farmers clubs in Thennamanallur, S G Palayam, Kallimedu and Puthur, all of which come under Thennamanallur panchayat,” says Meera. Farmers clubs have been particularly successful, she says. “It's a platform for farmers from around the area to meet regularly, share their experiences and learn of government schemes.”
Magalir mandrams meet every week to discuss issues pertaining to their village. For the women, most of whom are uneducated, being able to save money and maintain accounts is an immense confidence booster. Meera invites resource persons from various fields to address the women.
I watch one such meeting unfold on a Sunday afternoon in Puthur. Members of Thiruvalluvar and Roja magalir mandram are gathered under a neem tree. Advocate Janaki and Ravi, the Thondamuthur coordinator of ‘Vazhikattum Thittam', are the guests. Ravi talks of the various Government schemes for the differently-abled.
The ladies also discuss the location of a TASMAC outlet close by. “The shop is nuisance,” says Jothi. “Girls are afraid to walk by the road in the evenings. Our husbands head straight there after a day's work. Is there any way to shift it elsewhere?”
Meera and Janaki suggest they prevent their husbands from drinking instead. “There is an alcoholic's anonymous meeting next week in Coimbatore. Why don't you attend with your husbands?” asks Meera.
Meera takes down names of students who need tuitions. Math, Science and Computer tuitions are offered at the clinic by volunteers. Through CORD, Meera has also facilitated additional income generation activities for the women. In Puthur, for example, Angathal makes winnows and Devi makes paper covers. Old Kannamal and Palanichamy mix phenyl.
Self help
A shop in Thennamanallur is dedicated to products made by the women. They sell homemade pain balms, handmade sanitary napkins, paper bags, paper packets, wire baskets and vegetables straight from farmers.
Villagers have also been taught to segregate biodegradable and non-biodegradable wastes at home which Residents Awareness Association of Coimbatore (RAAC) collects. In fact, Meera received the ‘ECO award' from RAAC and the Association of British Scholars for encouraging eco-friendly activities in Thennamanallur.
With loans from local banks, over 170 families have built toilets at home after Meera has told them about the importance of hygiene. She speaks to adolescent girls about menstrual hygiene. Back at her clinic, she has pictorial guides on breast cancer and self-examination. There are charts and cards about the human body, symptoms of diseases, treatment options, etc. Says Meera, “I try to show as many cards as possible to my patients when they come for consultation.”
The 48-year-old is always busy. When she's not chairing a magalir mandram meeting, she's filling out a pension form for a patient. And when she's not organising a trip for the ladies to Gandhi Ashram, she's clipping the nails of an old, old lady in the village.

Leading a second life,Wednesday,2010-06-16,METRO PLUS,[]," Anonymous member of Hyderabad says motivation and a strong will to change is required to kick the habit. “It takes years to even identify and admit that one is an alcoholic,” says Sharath, who works as a senior corporate executive.
“One thinks of an alcoholic as the one who falls on the road, picks up a fight or languishes in poverty. None of these things happened to me and I would even maintain my demeanour after drinking which I thought was an achievement,” he says smiling. His situation got worse and when he was admitted to a rehab, his wife left him to go to Europe and his foreign-returned son visited the rehab but refused to meet him. “It hit me hard and I realised that the real damage has been done to me and the relationships I value most,” he says. Unlike the belief, alcoholism is not genetic say the members and the abuse is rampant among women too.
“Women have more problems with alcohol than men,” says Shekhar. The pub-hopping women present a confident and independent picture but there are a few lady members, who are out of rehab centres but do not want to come out of closet fearing rejection and humiliation."
