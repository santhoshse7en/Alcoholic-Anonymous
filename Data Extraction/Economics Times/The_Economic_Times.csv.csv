Amit’s addiction story started with his college friends telling him to try a shot of alcohol at a wedding “just one time”, followed by peer pressure to “smoke only when you are drinking”. He discovered that drinking and smoking relieved the stress of cramming for exams, dealing with family issues and keeping up with his ‘cool’ college gang. And in just a few months, the one shot of alcohol turned to several glasses a day, followed by the need to smoke a couple of cigarettes every hour, resulting in loss of health, while burning a massive hole in his pocket.Multiple factors come into play, which decide whether someone becomes an addict or not.Dr H Chandrashekar, head of the department of psychiatry at Victoria Hospital, Bengaluru, says that while addiction usually runs in the family, the cause is multifactorial and varied, and cannot be attributed to one single reason.“One study found that addiction among children of alcoholic parents was three-four times higher when compared to other children,” he says. “It is also found that a dopamine-dependent reward pathway present in the brain is more active in persons exhibiting addictive behaviour. Patients suffering from personality disorders or psychiatric illnesses are more susceptible to addiction. Inability to confer to social norms, defiant behaviour and the resulting ostracisation can make one dependent on substances and sustain its abuse,” he says.Dr Jyoti Kapoor, senior psychiatrist at Gurugram-based Paras Hospitals, says the causes could be psychological, such as stress, anxiety, emotional issues, depression and psychosis; environmental, such as drug availability, peer pressure and social sanction; and genetic — epidemiological studies of twins and families have demonstrated a genetic contribution of 30-60% in developing addiction.“Substance abuse disorders are classified in medical science as an illness but the society still looks at them as a characterological trait that the sufferer is solely responsible for. Although sociocultural factors play a significant role in substance-use behaviour, genetic and biological influences can’t be discounted. These factors make an individual vulnerable to addiction and develop the mental and behavioural disorders related to substance use,” she says.Dr Kamna Chhibber, head of mental health at the department of mental health and behavioural sciences at Delhi-based Fortis La Femme, says poor family support, the need to look ‘cool’, challenging circumstances, poor coping abilities, weak problem-solving abilities, poor self-control and a desire to escape problems instead of solving them are also factors.The term addiction is used only when the individual cannot continue to lead his/her life without the consumption of the substance, says Chhibber.“They require increased amounts of the substance with time. The continued and consistently increasing consumption of the substance disrupts normal life, causing individuals to neglect other activities in favour of taking the drugs ,” she says.According to Kapoor, every substance has the potential to harm the body if used in excess.“Excessive use of alcohol causes adverse effects on the liver, stomach, pancreas, brain and nerves, resulting in associated medical conditions like liver cirrhosis, pancreatitis, memory disturbances, seizures, psychiatric illnesses and peripheral neuropathy. Other common drugs similarly affect various body organs, especially the liver, kidney and brain. Needle-users are at a risk of damage to blood vessels, leading to blocked blood vessels (thrombophlebitis), endocarditis and infections like hepatitis and HIV. Drugs also cause inhibition of immune system with an increased risk of infection, slowing of the gastrointestinal system, increased somnolence, respiratory depression, increased risk of seizure, increased risk of accidents and nutritional deficiencies,” she says.The withdrawal effects of drugs have further physical effects ranging from severe anxiety to disorientation, delirium and central nervous system side effects, she says.Apart from the physical effects, “psychosocial consequences include precipitation of psychiatric illnesses like anxiety or panic attacks, depression, paranoia, obsessions and delusions. Interpersonal relationships are affected, leading to further isolation and reliance on drug addicts and drug peddlers. Academic and professional downfall is a direct consequence of increased preoccupation with drug use and effects of drugs”, she says.Amit's situation worsened to such an extent that days and nights merged into one and his life would not go forward without cigarettes and alcohol. He was in no position to understand that this wasn't normal. His addiction was controlling his life.According to Chhibber, the use of a substance that you are not in control of warrants treatment.“If you notice that you have a lot of craving and urge to consume a substance, that you are not able to go on with life without consuming it regularly, that you need more quantities of the substance to feel good, the lack of availability of the substance affects your mood or interferes with your daily life and functioning, that consumption of the substance happens at the cost of your work and personal life, you need to seek help,” she says.Apart from that, if you notice yourself neglecting responsibilities at home, school or work, losing interest in activities you once enjoyed, withdrawing from friends and family, increasingly neglecting personal hygiene or trying to hide the extent of your drug or alcohol use from others, it is time to consult a professional, says Kapoor.Dr Faiyaz Ali Maniyar, senior consultant physician at Bengalurubased Primecare Hospital, says it is always better to take professional help with the support of family members to treat addiction.“A high-quality treatment programme will begin with a medical detox to address physical dependence and restore brain functioning back to normal. Various alternative and traditional therapies are available, which identify underlying issues, identify and change unhealthy ways of thinking and behaving, and come up with strategies to help cope with cravings and other triggers,” he says. “There are also self-help organisations like Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous, as well as religious and moralistic paths that could be useful.”In Amit's case, it was a friend's mother who noticed that he had become irregular in his visits to their house and decided to find out what was wrong. In denial at first, Amit went into a shell. It was only after constant prodding, without making him feel guilty, that she got the facts out. After that, a combination of treatment paths put him on the track to normalcy.While Chhibber says abstinence from the consumption of substances is the key to preventing addictions, Kapoor says awareness and education are vital.“Addiction needs to be understood and accepted as an illness so that susceptible individuals can come forward for education and help. Curtailing availability of substance with a stringent execution of the law is important. Drug peddlers target schools and young adolescents as they are the most susceptible. Parents and teachers need to be educated to identify and handle these issues. Being punitive towards students who have been found to be experimenting with alcohol, cigarettes or drugs only shoves the dirt under the carpet. One needs to empathise and understand their issues to guide them. School counsellors have a major role to play here,” says Kapoor. “Identifying vulnerable population with a family history of substance abuse or other psychiatric problems is also imperative in starting early intervention.”Addiction need not just be substance addiction. Behavioural addiction refers to conditions where a person engages in a certain type of behaviour repeatedly, even if the behaviour causes harm. Common behavioural addictions include gambling addiction, shopping addiction, hoarding, internet addiction, smartphone addiction, gaming addiction, sex addiction and porn addiction. However, experts continue to debate the existence, the diagnostic criteria and possible treatments for these conditions.- Sudden changes in mood and behaviour- Staying aloof and being disinterested- Sudden change in academic/ work performance- Needing extra money consistently- Consistently having bloodshot eyes, dilated or constricted pupils- Drastic weight loss over a short period of time- Evidence of drug use on the body, such as needle marks- Hostility when confronted about drug use- Disinterest in personal hygiene and grooming- Shakiness or tremors- Unable or unwilling to quit using drugs and alcohol despite financial, family, health and legal problems- Encourage the individual to seek help and work on the problem- Be empathic: Guilt prevents people from opening up to others who may judge or criticise them. Addicts feel a lack of control over their behaviour and thus, feel helpless. They need to be assured that help is available- Help them stay away from people and situations where there is a chance of consuming a substance- Support them by working in accordance with the suggestions of the expert being consulted- Withdrawal symptoms can be dangerous by themselves, so talk to a professional and get the right care","['affects', 'drug', 'brain', 'anxiety', 'behaviour', 'alcohol', '2007', 'family', 'drugs', 'cause', 'substance', 'disorder', 'help', 'paranoia', 'directly', 'delusions', 'addiction', 'kidney', 'need']","She was sentenced to 30 days in jail, but was released after only three hours because the system works.

Utterly Butterly Blissful,"Since I write in CD, it might be assumed I’m in favour of more professional management. And so I am, but I must admit that in one category I have my doubts. These are the...",['Vikram Doctor'],2010-02-26 00:00:00,"Since I write in CD, it might be assumed I’m in favour of more professional management. And so I am, but I must admit that in one category I have my doubts. These are the clubs and gymkhanas scattered across India, relics of the Raj, now colonised by the Indian middle classes. It’s true these were probably never very professionally run (despite the valiant efforts of many ex-army officer managers), and over time standards have slipped, so some degree of refurbishment and professionalization is welcome.



But how far? A large part of the appeal of the clubs has been their unique atmosphere and in the rush to rejuvenate this risks getting lost. Its one thing to modernise the plumbing (much needed in some cases) and enable WiFi, but its quite another to turn their characteristic teakwood interiors into the sort of anonymous hospitality spaces that can be found in any hotel – which, ironically, are often installing wood panelling and call their bars ‘clubs’, to create the kind of atmosphere that clubs have naturally.



Perhaps the saddest signs of ill-judged modernisation are to be found on the menus. A lot of clubs these days have outsourced catering to local contractors and while this has had some good results, like more Indian food, all too often it comes at the cost of junking many beloved club dishes. Many of these were deeply connected to the history of these clubs, since they were the home dishes of the British, whose cooking is much mocked by those who don’t know how simply satisfying they can be. Where are the shepherd’s pie, the Welsh rarebits and rugby stews? Where are the open beef sandwiches soaked in gravy, in fact, where is anything with gravy? And where, above all, is the perfect buttered toast?



The British have always had a special claim on buttered toast. It is not unique to them, since wherever there is bread gone stale, and which needs reheating, then toast will appear, and quite often butter too, to lather on while the toast is still hot, so that it melts and soaks in, to provide the perfect rich moistness to the crisp dry bread. Yet the British have always appropriated it quite as arrogantly as the Duke of Wellington did in 1814 when he landed in Dover after six years of fighting Napoleon, and ordered that the inn where he was staying had give an unlimited supply of buttered toast. In innumerable British books and memoirs you will find the Duke’s privilege reasserted – whatever else might be on the menu, there had to be lots of buttered toast.



Some argue that this was simply because of the damp British climate – hot toast was a restorative, both eaten by itself, or dunked in liquids of varying degrees of alcoholic strength, from where we get the concept of drinking toasts. Damp British bread was also a cause; where the French baguette is a light loaf, more crust than crumb and meant to be eaten soon, British breads have been heavier and moister, and are also baked less frequently. Kitchens always had a supply of slightly stale bread, so toasting was natural, on the open fires that the British also maintained.



Making toast, in fact, often moved out of the kitchens – since cold toast is an abomination, people realised the best thing to do was make it themselves. Children were often given the simple task of holding the toasting forks that put the slices of bread near the fire; as a job it was just exacting enough for them, involving cautious rotation and vigilance to make sure the slices didn’t burn – and it had the bonus of being able to eat the results. Toast was also one of the first solid foods fed to children, and all this combined to give it a particularly nostalgic value. John Betjeman, the poet of British nostalgia, used it to sum up a child’s world, “Safe, in a world of trains and buttered toast…”



It’s more than history though. Toast requires effort (you can buy bread, but have to make toast), and so it stands for care. The American food writer John Thorne recalled a story of a very poor mother in New York who once could only feed her children toast for a week; it haunted him both for the deprivation it depicted, and also the mother’s love: “there might be nothing but the cheapest sandwich loaf to eat, but she would at least make it into toast.” Nigel Slater, the British chef, titled his brilliant autobiography Toast for his mother, who died while he was young. A memory of her starts the book, of her scraping the burned part from toast for him: “it is impossible not to love someone who makes toast for you…”



Not that it’s easy. Slater admits his mother nearly always burned the toast, and for something so simple, good toast can be really hard to make. Proof of this is in the amazing number of machines invented to make it – at the Toaster Museum’s website (www.toaster.org) you will find an extraordinary range of machines in every kind of material and design, and yet it is still hard to find a good toaster. The ones I’ve used always either clog up with breadcrumbs that can’t be cleaned, burn toast or don’t cook it enough, can’t fit slices of the right size or just breakdown. These days I just make my toast on a tawa (good for a very slight charring that adds to the toast) or in the oven (good for an overall crispness).



Another complication is how thick to make toast. I like both really thin toast, like Melba toast, and also really thick slices – what doesn’t work are standard bread slices (which is all most toasters are designed for). Thin toast is all crisp perfection, whereas thick toast reverses the staling process in which starch molecules in the bread steadily lose their moisture and dry out. As Harold McGee explains, when you toast bread “water molecules move in between the starch molecules, and the granules and amylose gels become tender again. This is why toasting sliced bread makes the interior soft.” Thick toast gives you two great textures: crisp exterior, soft, warm interior, both just waiting for the blessing of butter.



This is another complication: butter before toasting or after? Buttering before makes sense when, as in India, butter is usually refrigerated and hard, so putting scrapings on bread and then grilling the two allows both melting and toasting to take place together. (Putting butter on the tawa and then the bread is too close to frying to be toasting). On the other hand, if the butter is soft enough, its better to put it on the warm bread and dreamily watch it melt till its ready to eat. One thing though I believe in strongly: our salty Indian butter is really ideal for making rich, tasty buttered toast.



With so many complications it can be a headache to do at home, and this is why I’ve always valued the buttered toast in clubs. Just sitting in their calm premises and ordering tea and toast is one of the most soothing things I know. This is why I was so worried when the club I go to most often changed caterers and for a while all I got was just tough slices of standard bread with barely any butter. Finally though things fell into place, and the proper toast appeared – thick, soaked in butter, and cut in three strips, two crunchy with crusts, but the best in the centre, demurely crustless, but crisp and bathed in butter. Bliss was back with buttered toast.

They keep experimenting with different blends to make it again, but always fail until, in a typical O.Henry twist, they realise that the missing ingredient was what was already in the barrel - plain water!



Secret ingredients are rather dubious things. When they are real they tend to be, as O.Henry suggests, really simple, just paradigm shifting (another example is Kentucky Fried Chicken where the real secret is not so much the blend of flavourings, but the pressurised frying pan used to cook the chicken). But that tiny pinch of a secret spice or the dash of flavouring from a bottle kept hidden in a cupboard? It's good for a story, and for the reputation of selfish cooks who want their secrets to go with them to their graves, but the actual value of any such ingredient to a dish is often overstated. Most of the time, unless a product is used in such quantities it is hard to conceal, it won't make a major difference. But I will admit to using one ingredient that isn't secret in the sense that I hardly conceal its use, but in that I'm not sure why it works - I just know it does! This is mirin, a liquid used in Japanese cooking that is vaguely described as sweet cooking spirit, Japanese rice wine, sweet sake and other terms that leaves its exact composition unclear. It is used in dipping sauces, as an addition to stir-fries and in marinades, particularly for fish since it has a reputation for removing unpleasant 'fishy' odours. It can even be drunk by itself, and apparently in some parts of Japan on Shogatsu, the traditional Japanese New Year, it is the custom to drink a concoction of herbs steeped in old-style alcoholic mirin.



This is not something you are likely to be able to make at home since getting really alcoholic mirin is now hard. Hiroko Shimbo's The Japanese Kitchen explains that the reasons for this lie in the rice shortages in Japan during and after the Second World War. What rice was available was either eaten directly or brewed into more potent sake (or distilled to shochu) while making mirin, which was mostly used as a condiment, was lower priority. Instead, alternatives were devised using alcohol, water, sugar and salt and these concoctions were OK for cooking, but not drinking. Since these were much cheaper than real mirin, people just continued using them for cooking and demand for real mirin dropped.



Today what you are most likely to find is this fake mirin, which is called aji mirin or mirin fo-chomiryo which means mirin-like seasoning. Connoisseurs of Japanese food disdain this and it is worth looking for mirin actually made from rice, like the Rice Mirin sold under the Clearspring brand. Tasting this alongside the more anonymous stuff, you get a clearly more chemical taste from the latter, but to be honest, this isn't really detectable in cooking. You can also get more complex styles of mirin like the Mikawa Mirin, also sold by Clearspring, which is made in a more traditional way and aged, and here the taste is much more interestingly complex and detectable.

Age at first drink linked to binge drinking risk,"An early age of onset of drinking is a risk factor for subsequent heavy drinking and negative outcomes, scientists found.",[],2014-09-24 19:15:00+00:00,"WASHINGTON: Teenagers who have their first drink at an early age are more likely to become a binge drinker or even an alcoholic, a new study has warned.An early age of onset of drinking is a risk factor for subsequent heavy drinking and negative outcomes, scientists found.The study found that starting to use alcohol at an early age and quickly progressing to drinking to intoxication jointly are related to underage alcohol use and binge drinking.Meghan E Morean, assistant professor of psychology at Oberlin College Ohio and adjunct assistant professor of psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine asked 295 adolescent drinkers (163 females, 132 males) who were predominantly Caucasian with an average age of 16 years to complete an anonymous survey about their substance use in February of 2010.These self-report questions assessed AO and age at first intoxication - for example, ""How old were you the first time you tried alcohol/got drunk?"" - as well as the previous month's consumption of alcohol, including an assessment of the frequency of engaging in binge drinking (defined as more than 5 drinks).""Our research suggests that teenagers who have their first drink at an early age drink more heavily, on average, than those who start drinking later on,"" said Morean.""Our work also suggests that how quickly teenagers move from having their first drink to getting drunk for the first time is an important piece of the puzzle.""In total, having your first drink at a young age and quickly moving to drinking to the point of getting drunk are associated with underage alcohol use and binge drinking, which we defined as five or more drinks on an occasion in this study.""To summarise, we would expect a teenager who had his first drink at age 14, and who got drunk at 15, to be a heavier drinker than a teenager who had his first drink at age 14, and waited to get drunk until age 18,"" Morean said.""The key finding here is that both age of first use and delay from first use to first intoxication serve as risk factors for heavy drinking in adolescence,"" added William R Corbin, associate professor and director of clinical training in the department of psychology at Arizona State University The research appears in Alcoholism : Clinical & Experimental Research.","['drunk', 'early', 'risk', 'drinking', 'age', 'binge', 'quickly', 'drink', 'teenagers', 'research', 'alcohol', 'linked']","- as well as the previous month's consumption of alcohol, including an assessment of the frequency of engaging in binge drinking (defined as more than 5 drinks).

No way or the highway,"Sitting here, in an undisclosed location 502 metres away from a National Highway that wishes to remain anonymous, I want to have what Justices Jagdish Singh Kehar, Dhanandjaya Y Chandrachud and L Nageswara Rao were...",['Indrajit Hazra'],2017-04-16 00:00:00,"Sitting here, in an undisclosed location 502 metres away from a National Highway that wishes to remain anonymous, I want to have what Justices Jagdish Singh Kehar, Dhanandjaya Y Chandrachud and L Nageswara Rao were having when, on December 15, 2016, they passed the Supreme Court order prohibiting the sale of alcohol within 500 m of national and state highways.

The other alternative would be to drink myself blotto while trying to understand, with all the sincerity I can muster on Easter, the significance of having 500 m as the Lakshman rekha for imbibing the unholy stuff. What happens within this mysterious radius? Or, rather, since this is all about preventing bad stuff from happening, what will now no longer happen within this charmed circle?

The venerable Supreme Court, responding to a petition seeking the ban, has even used the reasoning of doing what the Centre had prepared in a ‘policy for alcoholic beverages and alcohol’ to dodge the bullet of ‘judicial overreach’. But that un-policied policy had mentioned turning spaces within 100 m from a state or national highway into a mini-Gujarat-Bihar. And as world record-holders Usain Bolt and David Rudisha know well, 500 m and 100 m have a 400 m farak.

The judges passed the order — after much earlier passing the bar — to ostensibly clamp down on drunken driving and minimise highway accidents, for which suitably numbers, damned numbers and statistics were duly trotted to make every child sleep in this post-Gabbar world.

I can only imagine the brain-movie that must have run through the venerable justices’ heads: A man procuring a bottle of the nasty stuff from a thek 323 m away from a highway. Glug-glugging half the bottle and returning to the car which he had been driving stone sober earlier. Now drunk, tyres a-squeal he sets out into the night, swerving and a potential roadrunner of a criminal driving into a tragedy.

The fact that a person behind a wheel need not have been denied a drink or two or four from a source that isn’t a liquor shop near a highway may have eluded the sober heads of justice. Perhaps, having a thek or a bar 500 m away from the car, rather than from a highway, would have been more logical. For, a 500 m walk can, indeed, do wonderful stuff to clear one’s head that a 100 m Keshto Mukherjee-inspired jaunt can only dream of.

The earlier court order was modified in a March 31 order that lowered the threshold from 500 m to 220 m for towns of fewer than 20,000 people. One supposes that there are less people or black buck a drunken driver who is not a Bollywood star can mow down in these places. This also gives a gentle nudge in favour of family planning, I reckon.

But a Patiala peg measure of confusion is poured down my hatch when I hear that the court has exempted Meghalaya and Sikkim from the ban, since that would have meant more than 90% of shops would have to be shut down. The message I am getting in this exemption is that if Pune, with 17 state highways passing through the city, had 175,800 liquor permit holders instead of the 1,758 that it really has, Pune — and who knows, maybe Maharashtra as a whole — would also have been exempted having ‘livelihoods at stake’.

Instead of planning to lay off many of their staff, standalone hotel and restaurant-owners affected by the highway booze ban should actually go on a hiring spree. That would put more livelihoods in jeopardy, and even the cold heart of justice will then hear — as it did from Meghalaya and Sikkim — plaintive sitar strains that always signify hardships in Hindi movies.

But what I still can’t get my not-yet-spinning head around is the mystery of the petitioner, Harman Sidhu, a man a year older than I am, so hopefully someone I should be able to understand. Sidhu has been wheelchair-bound since a road accident in 1996.

Was he hit by a drunken motorist? No. Was he a drunken driver himself who paid the price of driving under the influence? Nyet.

Sidhu was reportedly in a car with two friends returning to Chandigarh from Himachal Pradesh and sitting in the back seat when the three friends spotted a leopard. They decided to “drive off road” to see if they could catch it again. But the car fell into a gorge. In his own words, there is no mention of drinking.

Er, so why does the highway theka or hotel bar or liquor shop get the rap? Call it the majesty of justice akin to banning smoking, because even though the fire was caused by faulty wiring, it’s still about wanting you to quit smoking for your own good. A little dodgy logic can be forgiven when the cause is good. So what if this also means the breathalyser industry also taking a hit. And there being no need any longer in many stretches of this land of ours for a policeman to tell you to breathe into his face. Such awkwardness will be now avoided.

Dear god, let me get a drink 501 m away from this highway, which I hope will very soon, inspired by the West Bengal government, be denotified and turned into an ‘arterial road’. Cheers.","['500', 'court', 'car', 'highway', 'driving', 'm', 'having', 'order', 'drunken', 'stuff', 'way']","But that un-policied policy had mentioned turning spaces within 100 m from a state or national highway into a mini-Gujarat-Bihar.

WASHINGTON D.C. [USA]: We have all been there - taking leftover antibiotics to save a second trip to the doctor.However, a recent study has found that giving saved antibiotics to others - within and outside the family - fuels rising rates of antibiotic-resistant infections The findings will be presented at the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) National Conference & Exhibition.Senior author Ruth Milanaik, said the study results show an ""alarming"" percentage of parents in a national sample report sharing or borrowing antibiotics, a practice called prescription diversion.""This is dangerous not only for those given antibiotics that weren't prescribed for them, but for entire populations of people who some antibiotics may no longer help when the bacteria they target become resistant to them,"" said Dr. Milaniak of New York’s Cohen Children's Medical Center.For the study, an anonymous online questionnaire was distributed to a national sample of 496 parents though Amazon Mechanical Turk. Nearly half (48.2 percent) of the parents reported that they had kept leftover antibiotics rather than properly disposing them.Of those, 73 percent subsequently diverted them to siblings, unrelated children, and unrelated adults--sometimes months after the antibiotic was originally prescribed--all without physician consultation. Parents also used the leftover antibiotics themselves.-The most common form of antibiotics diverted was liquids (80.4 percent of parents whose children were prescribed them) and drops (73.8 percent), compared to creams (69.7 percent) and tablets (55.6 percent).-The dosage of antibiotic that was administered was typically the prescribed dosage, even though the recipient of the antibiotic had changed, or was estimated based on the age of the child.-Overall, 16 percent of participants stated that they had given their child adult medications.Dr. Milanaik said more effort and resources need to be invested in educating families about how antibiotics work, that they aren't necessary for all illnesses, and the medical risks of taking antibiotics without consulting a health provider.""Although the discovery of antibiotics has revolutionized medicine, it is imperative that clinicians emphasize the importance of use and dispose of these medications properly to make sure they remain an effective tool against infectious diseases,"" Dr. Milanaik said.","['13', 'second', 'doctor', 'antibiotics', 'oct', 'shouldnt', 'key', 'trip', 'leftover', 'right', '2018', 'vitamin', 'grains', 'parents', 'happier', 'save']","Legumes 13 Oct, 2018 Consuming legumes will keep the blood sugar stable throughout the day, fostering happier mood, a key nutrient in creating a healthier gut.

NEW DELHI: The boom in India’s startup sector may be having an unlikely outcome: a lot more people are now searching for entrepreneurs to say “I do”, say matchmaking websites.In India, matrimonial profiles of self-employed people have traditionally been preferred by the business community. But top executives of cyber services like Matrimony.com and Shaadi.com, which run searchable databases of matrimonial material, say entrepreneurs are garnering a lot more clicks across communities following the boom in the country’s startup ecosystem.Rajasekar KS, general manager (marketing) at Matrimony.com, which runs matchmaking website Bharat Matrimony, said there’s been a marked increase in the preference for entrepreneurs over the last few years. “It is largely driven by the increasing success stories of entrepreneurs,” he told ET.A 26-year-old owner of a robotics startup, who did not wish to be named, said his parents often say in jest that it will be hard to find a match for him because of his “unstable income”—a reflection of the changing outlook towards entrepreneurs as potential life partners.Gourav Rakshit, CEO of Shaadi-.com, said the number of women showing interest in marrying entrepreneurs has gone up significantly in the last few years. “Over 20% women have shown interest in entrepreneurs,” he said.Jeevansathi.com senior vicepresident Rohan Mathur said he had seen a spike in women’s interest in self-employed men three-four years ago, when it was going up 10-12% on average. The percentage of interested women has now stabilised at 3.6%, he added.Shifts are visible in other directions too. For instance, professional women from business families are now keen on marrying professionals like themselves, according to matchmakers at smaller companies. This is because traditional business families generally don’t prefer women who want to devote long hours to their work, said Raspreet Singh Saluja, a veteran matchmaker at Sycoriaan Matrimonial Services, which has about 10,000 clients.Finance professionals, too, are in demand in the marriage market. “A huge number of business-background families look at finance professionals for their daughters and sons,” said Tania Malhotra Sondhi, cofounder of MatchMe, a Delhi-based personalised matchmaking service. Earlier, they would prefer even more affluent business families, she said.Rakshit of Shaadi.com said the number of clicks for finance professionals on Shaadi.com has risen significantly in the last few years, attributing it to the growth and success of private banks.Another positive change is that more women are now in control of their profiles on these websites, as opposed to their parents doing the monitoring, said Mathur and Rakshit. Defence professionals, too, are drawing a lot more interest in the marriage market, according to Rakshit.According to the major matrimonial websites, the number of people who call themselves atheists has gone up on the more high-end websites. Akhilesh Sharma, founder of curated matchmakers iBluebottle, said about 5% of his subscribers describe themselves as atheists.","['married', 'image', 'clicks', 'sites', 'profile', 'match', 'hilton', 'wedded', 'wwwimdbcom', 'couple', 'matrimonial', 'taylor', 'michael', 'todd', 'business', 'selfemployed', 'wilding']","(Image: www.imdb.com) Recently, Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta made a light-hearted mention in the Supreme Court of Elizabeth Taylor's seventh husband.

Bestselling author, and birthday boy, Chetan Bhagat likes to stir things up on social media from time to time. And Bhagat, one of the most celebrated authors amongst the millennial lot, boasts of 13.6K followers on Twitter But that doesn't stop the trolls. Case in point, tweets that earned author Chetan Bhagat Twitter's collective wrath. Even though Mr. Bhagat has tweeted multiple apologies after being trolled, the damage has been done.Over the years, he's become a punching bag for Twitter users who are quick to react every time he posts something controversial or downright stupid.On his part, Bhagat doesn't refrain from commenting on live issues, giving trolls ample opportunities to direct their fire his way over his bait-y tweets.Here are some notable instances when Twitter gave the author some major burns:After the Men in Blue defeated Pakistan in a cricket match by six wickets, Chetan Bhagat took to Twitter to blame the partition for Pakistan's loss.But he wasn't spared, and a terse response came his way.2. The ' Five Point Someone ' author tweeted a poll in October 2017 asking, "" Did you ever, as an Indian, saw the Taj as a 'Muslim' monument (as @washingtonpost is saying it's being neglected because it is Muslim)"".The author was referring to an article that states the monument wasn't allotted cultural heritage funds in the Uttar Pradesh budget for the coming year and was also not included in the state's official tourism brochure.However, what many on Twitter noticed in Mr Bhagat's tweet was a grammatical error, which he has since called a typo.His so-called typo wasn't spared.The grammar nazis sprang into action and ensured that there was no relief for Bhagat.Although, he had apologised for the error in a tweet in which he only got trolled further.Clearly, not many people bought his excuse on Twitter.The author, after the launch of his book 'One Indian Girl', had been tweeting about it, and promoting it, day and night. In one such tweet, the author tried to get people to tweet photos of his book, in a bid to promote it further.What Bhagat did not, but should have expected, was the degree of seriousness of the replies. As expected, people came up with the worst of photoshopped images and a few real ones that were just as bad.It was almost as if the author had invited the wrath of Twitterati.Bhagat, being the inspiration to most of the protagonists in his stories, did not back down. Sticking to the ""no press is bad press"" philosophy, Bhagat tried to save face by telling everyone how this little gimmick was his clever plan to get some easy press coverage.In fact, he went on to say ""I have learnt to use the hate and my trolls to aid my marketing. It really helps. Keep up the good work"". He ended his perfectly smug monologue with an old proverb about making the best of everything.When international journalist Piers Morgan, sparked an outrage on Twitter by commenting on India’s “wild celebrations” over its two medal-win at the Rio Olympics: “Country with 1.2 billion people wildly celebrates 2 losing medals. How embarrassing is that?”. However, the tweet didn’t go down well with Twitterati from India, including Bhagat.However, it seems Morgan was prepared for the troll attack, and responded cheekily, sometimes trolling the trolls as well. And, as usual Chetan Bhagat wasn't spared.The author could not contain himself and jumped to the nation's rescue, only to be trolled.Trust, Piers Morgan to make a comeback with a cheeky response.Finally, when Bhagat thought it was all over, it actually wasn't.And, how can we forget his infamous spat with Twinkle Khanna. The online feud started when a user complemented her writing skills and wrote, “You are an amazing writer, you don’t need to change your name to Chetali Bhagat.”To which, Twinkle wrote:Bhagat, who was a new judge on 'Nach Baliye 7', taunted the 'Jab Pyaar Kisise Hota Hai' actress and tweeted, “Well, I’d say you have the bigger challenge girl.. By the way, how do you tell the difference between the two anyway?.”Khanna aka Mrs. Funny Bones also had an interesting response.But never one to give up, Khanna made sure that she had the last word.","['based', 'bhagat', 'tweets', 'brought', 'movies', 'bhagats', 'chetan', 'kapoor', 'trolled', 'film', 'twitter', 'times', 'chetan_bhagat', 'author', 'house']","— Chetan Bhagat (@chetan_bhagat) 1458409822000.

_management discussion and analysis_

Industry Overview

During FY18 your Company delivered robust financial results despite significant regulatory hurdles and challenges faced by the Industry as a whole. In specific, the ban on sale of liquor on highways, lagging effects of demonetization, as well as increases in excise duties and changes in the route-to-market by certain States were several impediments against growth. Further, implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) effective July 01, 2017 contributed to increased input costs.

The most significant regulatory change was the introduction of the highway ban, which came into effect on April 01, 2017 and impacted growth in the first quarter of the year in particular. In the second quarter, some relief came from a Supreme Court clarification that States could de-notify highways passing through city limits, such that the ban would not apply to outlets located within city limits. This clarification resulted in a recovery of the industry and growth in sales volume.

Over the last five years, on an average, the beer industry recorded a steady growth of about 7% in volume terms. The per capita consumption of beer in India has increased by about 30% during that period. Given the favourable demographics in India, higher disposable income and affordability, changing cultural attitudes and a young, increasingly affluent population, consumption of beer is set to continue the steady growth pattern going forward. According to research by CISION, the Indian beer market is projected to grow at a CAGR over 7.6% during the period 2018-2024 driven by these factors.

The beer industry in India remains highly regulated with high taxation and government intervention in trade. In many parts of the country, wholesale and/or retail distribution is controlled by State Government monopolies. Also in over 60% of the markets, the respective State Government dictates the price at which beer can be sold. From time to time, significant regulatory restrictions and changes including prohibition pose a great challenge to the Industry as a whole. Conservative government policies, licensing regulations, restrictions on the sale of alcohol in certain states and a preference towards hard liquor are key reasons for the relatively slow development of India''s beer market.

With about 2 liter per capita, beer consumption is extremely low as compared to above 21 liters in other Asian countries. Spirits like whisky, vodka, brandy and rum are highly preferred by consumers in India. However, a growing segment of consumers is shifting towards beer owing to its lower alcohol content. Whilst the strong beer segment far exceeds the mild beer segment in terms of volume, mild beer is expected to outperform the strong beer segment in terms of growth, driven by health-conscious consumers and moderate drinkers who opt for lower alcohol content.

Off-trade contributes a significant share of the volume of the industry on account of more reasonable pricing as compared to the on-trade. However, on-trade channels are anticipated to exhibit high growth rates in the coming years, owing to rising income levels. Canned beer is gaining momentum as it is easier to handle and can be easily transported from one place to another. Moreover, freshly brewed, on-tap beer is demonstrating healthy growth. There has been a trend of emerging brew pubs in large cities such as Bengaluru, Pune and Gurgaon over the last few years. These outlets have introduced consumers to new types of beers, e.g. wheat beer and India Pale Ale.

During the FY 2017-18 your Company added about 1.5% market share over the previous year volume and grew by 10%. This was the first double-digit volume growth since FY 2010-11. UBL''s sales volume improved in key profitable markets, with strong market share gains in most large states across the country, especially in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Orrisa, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

Kingfisher Premium Lager and Kingfisher Strong continued to add market share in their respective categories. Your Company''s super premium brands continued to be among the fastest growing brands in the country, fueled by Ultra, Ultra Max, Heineken and a range of imported beer brands. Benefiting from a strong brand portfolio, established infrastructure, a highly skilled and dedicated workforce and several other factors, your Company continues to outperform the industry.

Impact of Goods and Services Tax

Goods and Services Tax (GST) was made effective on July 01, 2017. GST is a destination based tax on consumption of goods and services levied at all stages right from manufacture up to final consumption with credit of taxes paid at the previous stages available for setoff. The Central GST and the State GST are levied simultaneously on every transaction of supply of goods and services except on exempted goods and services.

The Government has kept alcoholic beverage industry outside the purview of GST. Since input materials used by UBL attract GST, it has resulted in higher tax incidence on input materials pushing up our cost of production with no tax credit availability. This has also resulted in a cascading effect on the profits of your Company.

The Management, however, has actively mitigated the negative impact through better commercial negotiation with the suppliers.

Sales and Marketing

UBL continues to lead in the Indian Beer market, with a volume that is more than twice that of its nearest competitor. Kingfisher Strong continues to be the single largest brand in the Indian beer market with sales recording more than 100 million cases for the first time. Kingfisher Premium continues to be the first choice of mild beer consumers across the country. The super-premium brands in our portfolio viz., Kingfisher Ultra, Kingfisher Ultra Max and Heineken are the top three fastest growing brands in the Indian market. These brands have been established in India as world class super premium beer brands. Kingfisher Ultra and Kingfisher Ultra Max are associated with Fashion and Style platform. Ultra Shorts web series had several stories and episodes released with combined views of over 30 million.

Heineken, one of the fastest growing brands in UBL''s portfolio, has established itself as India''s most premium brand. It leverages the Global marketing platforms of Football (UEFA Champions League), by associating with James Bond and Music. We have also created a highly successful India specific digital film for Heineken which achieved 20 million views across platforms.

The Company continues sustainable investment in brand building activities for Kingfisher in the fields of Sports, Food, Fashion and Music. We have a significant and market leading presence in the Indian Premier League T20 Cricket Tournament, the Indian Super League Football tournament, Kingfisher East Bengal Football Club and the Sunburn EDM festival. Our association with restaurants, bars, pubs, clubs and star hotels is uninterrupted. We have additional digital and television communication around the food platform with three interesting films.

The Kingfisher Calendar continues to maintain its high aspiration value. We have created excitement around this property and leveraged it on digital platforms in a large way. We have also launched Pitchers, India''s leading Nightlife App, in Mumbai, Delhi, Gurugram, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune.

We have also launched a highly differentiated and exciting new beer brand, Kingfisher Storm. The brand has been received very favourably by consumers and has achieved 1 million cases'' sales in its first year. Going ahead, as we roll out to other markets, the prospects for this brand are very promising.

Catering to the growing demand for a premium, strong quality beer in the Indian market, your Company recently launched the iconic Dutch beer brand Amstel, a new International super premium strong beer in the Indian market. Amstel is a slow brewed and extra matured lager, internationally appreciated for its quality and enjoyed in over 100 countries across the globe. This launch brings another major imported brand into the UBL product portfolio. Currently launched in Karnataka, Amstel will be available pan-India in current financial year.

Supply chain

Our manufacturing expenses for the FY18 amounted to Rs.26,412 million, representing 21% of sales, as against Rs.21,942 million in the previous financial year, which also constituted 21% of sales. This has been achieved through tight cost control in the manufacturing process in an environment of relatively high inflation.

Bottles remain our biggest cost element. Our decision to move to dedicated bottles with Trade Mark and design registration has ensured tight control on the cost of recycled bottles. In our endeavour towards reducing our environmental impact, we have adopted NNPB technology (less weight, less energy, less environmental impact) in about two-third of our new bottle purchases, which allows the company to source new bottles with reduced weight, better distribution of glass and with this the Company has got bottles at a reduced price, better stability and lower breakages.

Barley-malt is the basic raw material in the manufacture of beer. Barley prices in India fluctuate widely and availability is also scarce. Apart from procuring Barley-malt locally, your Company also imports barley from other countries to meet the demand.

Key material imports for the Heineken brand (bottles & labels) have now been localized and substituted with Heineken approved local vendors. This has ensured lower procurement cost and greater flexibility of sourcing. Softening of commodity prices coupled with better negotiations have helped us contain prices.

We are continuing our efforts to develop new varieties of barley in association with leading Government Institutes. We work with farmers in helping them cultivate barley and provide them with good quality seeds and offer a package of good practices in order to increase productivity.

Research and Development

UBL''s Research and Development function continues to support our growth strategy with focus on new capabilities, development of new products, enhancement of existing products, productivity improvement and cost reduction.

Human Resources

Employees are your Company''s biggest and most valuable asset. UBL provides a congenial working environment which enables success through ownership, camaraderie, freedom of thought and action. We nurture our human resources through mentoring, coaching, learning & development programs etc. We believe in celebrating milestones, both big and small and encourages its employees to connect, communicate and collaborate through various platforms enabled by the Company. We have employee friendly policies viz., leave, travel, medical etc. which keeps UBL employees happy and productive. The talent pool is refreshed from time to time by infusing new hires from premier colleges of the Country. Industrial Relations continued to be harmonious and peaceful at all levels and at all locations of the Company.

UBL has 2,837 employees on its rolls across all locations. The Company has not offered any stock options to the employees during the year under review. All the wage agreements have been renewed in a timely manner and are valid and subsisting. Workers and unions support implementation of reforms that impact quality, cost and improvements in productivity across all locations, which is commendable.

Total employee benefit expenses for the year stood at Rs.3,946 million, as compared to Rs.3,521 million in the previous year. This constituted 3.18% of revenue from operations. Employee benefit expenses were higher on account of salary increases. Your Directors place on record their sincere appreciation to all employees for their contribution towards the continuous success of the organization.

_corporate social responsibility and sustainability_

Over the years, UBL has striven towards sustainable development. It is interpreted as growing the company in a socially and environmentally responsible manner, while meeting the legitimate interests of the stakeholders. After all, to be truly successful, companies need to have a corporate mission that is bigger than just making profit. Your company and its employees are committed to the community we work with and the environment we extract our resources from.

With a population of 1.3 billion, India, with its diversity, faces multitude of social issues and ecological concerns. Your Company, as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), works with the communities residing near its breweries as a starting point. Your Company has integrated CSR in its corporate strategy and intends to drive it with a vision to bring about sustainable social development for its co-communities. The CSR Policy of the Company is posted on the website www.unitedbreweries.com and is available through the link http://unitedbreweries.com/csr.

Under the Safe Drinking Water Programme initiated in 2015, we have covered another 28 villages in the states of Haryana and Odisha, during the year under review. Through this initiative, we have been successful in providing access to safe drinking water to nearly 75,600 individuals in these villages. Another project has been launched in Mysore, Karnataka. Until now, your Company has reached out to 59 villages covering nearly 1.54 lac individuals.

In addition to implementing rainwater harvesting and watershed management projects in and around our breweries, we have also undertaken recycling of the treated waste water within the breweries. With extensive measures, the practice of harvesting rainwater has been extended to the nearby communities by incorporating the necessary infrastructure.

Your Company intends to be a Water Neutral Organization by 2025 and our efforts have been focused in this direction. We initiated new projects in Haryana, Punjab and Karnataka. Ponds have been adopted for rejuvenation in these states and in Karnataka, rooftop rainwater harvesting has been undertaken in several houses in villages around Nandi hills. In our efforts to recharge the freshwater consumed by our breweries, by March 2018, we were able to recharge 53% water. Our water conservation efforts have resulted in the recharge of over 25,61,930 KL water per year.

UBL''s initiatives in the field of education have been in tandem with its endeavors to enhance the educational experience and improve the quality of primary education for children, especially from the underprivileged sections. Our breweries across the country have adopted neighboring Government schools and supported them in meeting their requirements on a regular basis. In addition to this, we have focused education projects being implemented in Rajasthan and Karnataka. Your Company''s efforts in certain backward regions of Alwar, Rajasthan have been concentrated towards giving a facelift to 10 Government Schools in terms of infrastructure and gradually to improve the teaching-learning experience. Last year, we re-built another Government Primary school in Gandharpalya in Karnataka along with the provision of a mini science centre. We established another mini science centre in Aslimpur, Rajasthan, in the Government High School, with 80 running science models. The education initiatives benefit over 11,000 school children.

In the last quarter, your Company, conducted a week long awareness programme on ""Responsible Consumption of Alcohol"" for truck drivers associated with UBL, at four of our breweries in Karnataka and Telangana. The awareness programme was conducted with a goal to make them aware of the implications of drunk driving on their financial and social wellbeing and received an overwhelming response in terms of positive feedback from the truck drivers.

Your Company continues to provide primary healthcare services to the communities where the need has been expressed. Health camps with the community and in schools have been conducted during the year. Mid-day meals have been supported for 1,666 children in Government schools of Mangalore.

Sustainability

UBL''s sustainability reporting articulates its perspective on the emerging forces in the global sustainability landscape and UBL''s response on multiple dimensions. For each of the three dimensions i.e. economic, ecological and social sustainability, we articulate key issues as well as opportunities that emerge and update our engagements.

Towards sustainability, UBL has undertaken proactive measures in water consumption, rain water harvesting and reduction in energy consumption thereby reducing the carbon foot print, energy and fuel consumption.

Your Company has adopted various energy saving measures by switching over to renewable sources of energy. During FY18, the Company generated 22,11,539 units of electricity from the roof top solar power plants set up at Mallepally (near Hyderabad), Aurangabad , Mumbai, Srikakulam and Dharuhera (Haryana) breweries. Further, your Company has started utilizing wind power at breweries located at Bengaluru, Mangalore and Mysore to the tune of around 71% of the total power consumption at these breweries. A total of 1,29,55,000 units from wind power was wheeled in to these breweries in this financial year. Your company started utilizing wind power at breweries located near Chennai. A total of 26,67,600 units from wind power was wheeled into these breweries in this financial year. On account of the shift from conventional sources to renewable energy, UBL has achieved a carbon foot print reduction to the tune of 15,159 tonnes of carbon di-oxide.

The overall renewable energy contribution for FY18 out of the total power consumption stands at 15.36% for our own breweries and 12.88% of the total power consumption for own and contract breweries.

UBL is in the process of rolling out its first Sustainability Report in the current financial year and the same will be posted on the website of the Company.

_opportunities, threats, risks & concerns_

Compared to various International markets and even compared to other markets in Asia, beer penetration is very low in India. In India, beer account for very low share of consumption compared to other alcohol products. Such low consumption along with cultural change, higher disposable income and demographics offers a great opportunity.

While Indian beer industry presents considerable opportunities for growth, the overall growth is slowed down due to heavy regulatory environment, lack of retail formalization, restrictions in trade, negative industry tag, etc. For the States, one of the easiest ways to get higher revenue is to increase tax and duties on liquor products resulting into higher end consumer prices, thereby impacting growth.

Government regulations in particular pose a significant risk to the overall alcohol market in India, including for beer. Examples include the ban imposed by the Supreme Court on sale of liquor within half a kilometre of state and national highways, prohibition imposed in Bihar effective April 2016 followed by ban on exports imposed in April 2017. Higher duties imposed by States on liquor also remains a major concern which is beyond the control of the manufacturers.

Despite these challenges, favourable demographics of India is attracting foreign brewers to invest in beer market in the country. The combination of two international brewers in India recently has the potential to pose stiff competition. However, your Company is adequately protected from these risks and concerns due to its robust brand portfolio and a loyal consumer base.

Emerging Craft Beer Culture - Influenced by trends from Europe and the US, India is rapidly developing its own craft beer culture with brands such as Bira 91 becoming popular among Indian consumers. Although India''s craft beer industry is still nascent, the craft beer segment and demand for premium beer in general is estimated to be growing at a strong double digit rate albeit from a low base. Your Company is preparing a craft and variety beer offering of its own to capture growth in this segment.

Also, the concept of microbreweries is growing rapidly in the country. So far only a few States have issued licenses for microbreweries. However, with tremendously growing consumer demand for craft beer, other States are also planning to allow microbreweries in their regions.

Whilst the beer market continues to expand, your Company is looking at the larger beverage consumption occasions to further drive the growth of the business. For most adults the beverage choices for non-alcoholic occasions are limited. We have been working on tapping into this opportunity with a portfolio of non-alcoholic beers that deliver on refreshment and taste. These new offerings will also enable us to enter a much larger retail universe that is today closed to us. Our new offerings will be produced at our brewery in Bihar and are scheduled to be test marketed commencing the 3rd quarter of the current financial year.

A separate vertical has been created to drive this business in a focused manner so as to unlock its full potential. We see this business contributing significantly to the company in the years to come.

Whilst these type of products have been introduced by beer companies around the world, your Company will be a pioneer in India.

Prospects

With a market share of about 52%, UBL continues to remain a market leader in the beer industry in India. Young demographics with 50% of the population below 25 years of age and 65% below the age of 35 years, changing culture and very low per capita consumption are key drivers of growth of beer in India. The industry has been expanding regularly and it is expected that the next year too, the Industry will grow by about 6 to 8%. UBL shall continue its focus on innovative and effective marketing to lead the market. Your Company is hopeful of outperforming the industry in 2018-19 as well.

Growth in premium retail trade and on premise outlets in metropolitan cities has increased the range of beers and improved the retail environment. In a few States, the Government has issued separate licenses for sale of beer in super markets which signals good growth prospects for the industry. Innovative introductions also help in penetrating untapped markets and your Company''s new introductions have fared well. Effective marketing strategies have helped us reinforce our position as the clear market leader in the Country. Our flagship brand, Kingfisher is almost synonymous with beer in India.

UBL continues to invest significantly in brand visibility to sustain high recall for its brands amongst consumers. High profile sponsorships and brand activations have ensured that its brands, especially Kingfisher, retain their iconic status. The Company has a strong route-to-market, combined with a portfolio of market leading brands. UBL also continues to invest in both, capacities and brands.

Even in a highly competitive market, your Company has not only successfully overcome the challenges of the industry, but also outpaced several global beer brands that have entered India in the recent past and has constantly maintained its leadership position.

Risk Management

Your Company has in place a robust framework for managing and mitigating various risks. Considering the risks affecting the beer industry, UBL continuously assesses and updates the risk management framework based on changes in the level of risk. To achieve this control, UBL performs risk assessment in which Strategic, Operational, Information Technology, Financial and other Risks are analysed. This is reviewed regularly by the Internal Audit team, Risk Management Committee and the Board. The Management Committee meets regularly to address various risks and mitigation thereof. UBL has evolved a framework for management of business risks. We periodically assess risks in the internal and external environment, along with the potential cost of the risks and incorporate risk management plans in our strategy, business and operational plans.

UBL has explored a variety of avenues to contain the risk of continued increase in basic costs and has entered into a few long term agreements for sourcing vital inputs. There has been a continuous review of the long term strategy for procurement at an economical cost.

As part of our Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives, UBL has committed to availability of safe drinking water for communities residing in the vicinity of each of its 21 owned breweries. We have been continuously working towards water conservation and minimizing water waste by recycling to the extent possible. All our breweries have rainwater harvesting systems in place. From a consumption level of about 6 litres of water per litre of beer produced about a decade ago, we are at a level of about 3.24 litres per litre of beer today. This is lower than the world average of about 4 litres. Some of our newer breweries are at a level of 2.5-2.8 litres of water per litre of beer. This would place your Company amongst the elite of world breweries in the area of water consumption.

UBL has constituted a Risk Management Committee comprising senior Board members. The Committee reviews the risk impact matrix comprising strategic, preventable, external, internal, operational and compliance risks associated with business objectives and the actions taken to address these risks. Mitigation plans for such risks are in place and are reviewed periodically. Further, the Assurance Committee comprising functional Heads, reviews identified risks and takes mitigating actions on a quarterly basis. The Company has formulated a Risk Management Policy and has laid down procedures for risk assessment, identification, minimization and mitigation which are presented to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors on a periodical basis.

Internal control System

UBL has established a robust system of Internal Controls to ensure that assets are safeguarded and transactions are appropriately authorized, recorded and reported. With the introduction of Internal Controls in Financial Reporting (ICFR) in the Act, we have made an evaluation of functioning and quality of internal controls.

The Internal Financial Control framework of your Company is established in accordance with COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations) framework and is commensurate with the size and operations of your Company''s business. In addition to statutory mandate, Internal Audit evaluates and provides assurance of its adequacy and effectiveness through periodic reporting. Controls in place are routinely evaluated and certified by the Internal and Statutory Auditors and gaps are identified by the Auditors through a detailed testing exercise. The process of internal control ensures orderly and efficient conduct of business, safeguarding of assets, prevention and detection of frauds and errors, accuracy and completeness of accounting records and timely preparation of reliable financial information. Financial Statements are prepared on the basis of the Significant Accounting Policies that are carefully selected by management. The Accounting Policies are reviewed and updated from time to time. These, in turn are supported by a set of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that have been established for the business. The SOPs and controls are reviewed by management and audited periodically.

Internal Control evaluates adequacy of segregation of duties, transparency in authorization of transactions, adequacy of records and documents, accountability & safeguarding of assets and reliability of the management information system. Periodic reviews are carried out for identification of control deficiencies and opportunities for bridging gaps with best practices along with formalization of action plans to minimize risks.

The Company believes that the overall internal control system is dynamic and reflects the current requirements at all times thereby ensuring that appropriate procedures and operating and monitoring practices are in place.

Performance Evaluation of Directors

Performance evaluation of non-Independent Directors, Independent Directors, the Board as a whole and Committees of the Board has been carried out in accordance with the statutory provisions as contained in the Act and Listing Regulations.

To ensure an effective evaluation process, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC) has put in place a robust framework for conducting the exercise with key steps and practices defined clearly. Performance of the Board is evaluated on various parameters such as composition, strategy, tone at the top, risk and controls and diversity. Also a questionnaire for Committees is framed on parameters such as adherence to the terms of reference and adequate reporting to the Board. Parameters for the Directors included intellectual independence of the Director, participation in formulation of business plans, constructive engagement with colleagues and understanding of the risk profile of the Company.

Keeping in view the sensitivity and confidentiality associated with the exercise, an external agency was engaged to anchor the process. As part of this process, customized questionnaires, were circulated to all Directors of the Company. Each Director was required to undertake self-assessment. Additionally, the effectiveness of the Board and Committees was also evaluated by each member of the Board and Committee. Responses from Directors were submitted through an electronic platform and were kept confidential.

In order to maintain confidentiality of the entire process, the exercise was carried out on an anonymous basis and summary of responses received from Directors was placed and discussed at a Board meeting and individual scores circulated to the Director concerned. Discussions on a one-to-one basis with individual Directors were also organized for those Directors who wanted a more in-depth understanding. Recommendations arising from this entire process will be considered to improve overall effectiveness of individual Director, Board and Committees.

LONDON: Depressed people could be at an increased risk of developing irregular heartbeat, says a study.Anti-depressants have been previously linked with some serious, but rare heart rhythm disturbances, prompting the question of whether they might also raise the risk of atrial fibrillation However, in the study, the risk of irregular heartbeat was 7.65-fold higher before starting anti-depressants, suggesting that anti-depressant medication itself is not associated.On the other hand, taking anti-depressant drugs helped reduce the depressive symptoms, the study showed.""The message for patients who already have atrial fibrillation is that you do not need to be concerned about taking anti-depressant medication if you need it,"" said Morten Fenger-Gron, from the Aarhus University in Denmark.""Look after your mental health because our study supports existing evidence that problems with the mind can be detrimental for the heart,"" he added.For the study, the team included 785,254 Danish citizens initiating antidepressant treatment.The risk of atrial fibrillation was assessed after starting treatment and in the month before when it was assumed that patients were depressed but medically untreated.The findings, published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, showed that patients taking anti-depressants -- used as an indicator of depression -- had a 3.18-fold higher risk of atrial fibrillation during the first month of treatment compared with the general population.However, the association gradually reduced thereafter -- to 1.37-fold at 2 to 6 months and 1.11-fold at 6 to 12 months.""Filling a prescription for anti-depressants, which we used as an indicator of depression, was associated with a three-fold greater risk of atrial fibrillation. The decrease with time could suggest that treatment may alleviate this risk,"" Fenger-Gron said.Atrial fibrillation causes 20 to 30 per cent of all strokes and increases the risk of dying prematurely which include signs such as palpitations, shortness of breath, tiredness, chest pain and dizziness.","['intake', 'fibrillation', 'fluid', 'patients', 'wont', 'condition', 'risk', 'spare', 'heart', 'depression', 'potassium', 'salt', 'failure', 'arrhythmia']","Cardiac or heart failure is a clinical condition in which the heart loses the ability to eject blood to meet the requirements of the tissues of the body.

TORONTO: Children who suffer from depression are six times more likely to have skill deficits , such as difficulties with social interactions or academics, a study has found.Scientists say that up to three per cent of children between ages 6-12 might have major depressive disorder , but parents and teachers also had difficulties recognising depression in children.""When you ask teachers and parents to rate a child's level of depression, there is usually only about 5-10 per cent overlap in their ratings,"" said Keith Herman, a professor at University of Missouri in the US.""For example, the teacher might report that a child has difficulties making friends in class, but the parent might not notice this issue at home,"" said Herman.""Some people would view that overlap as the truth about a child's well-being and areas of disagreement as errors, but we need to explore the possibility that they each are seeing different aspects of children's behaviour and mental health,"" he said.Researchers completed profile analyses of 643 children in early elementary school to explore how patterns between student, teacher and parent reporting can be used to gain a holistic picture of a child's mental health.They found that even though 30 per cent of children in the study reported feeling mildly to severely depressed, parents and teachers often failed to recognise the child as depressed.However, teachers and parents were more skilled at identifying other symptoms that might predict long-term risk for depression, such as social problems, inattention and skill deficits.This could be crucial, as Herman found that the children showing severe signs of depression were six times more likely to have skill deficits than their peers.Also read: Decoded: How depression and sleep are directly linked to each other ""The gold standard for identifying children who might be at risk for developing depression later in life is to ask the children themselves,"" Herman said.""However, even if a child doesn't say they feel depressed, certain outward behaviors might provide clues to the state of the child's mental health,"" he said.""It's important for teachers and parents to catch these behaviours early to prevent long-term problems that occur with depression,"" he added.Mental health professionals can work with teachers and parents to identify depressive symptoms early by including self reports from children in mental health evaluations.Screenings also should consider social difficulties, inattention and skill deficits as this might help provide support to at-risk students before they develop further depressive symptoms.","['point', 'play', 'poor', 'school', 'image', 'store', 'getting', 'children', 'family', 'depression', 'grades', 'child', 'parents', 'severe', 'app', 'childs']","(Text: Rajarshi Bhattacharjee) Monster Messenger 15 Jun, 2018 App Store, Play Store, Amazon.com It is a fun messaging app to connect with your kids when you are away.

"Social pressures causing 'global sleep crisis', Health News, ET HealthWorld","Lack of sleep is mostly affected by the time people go to bed, the study found.",[],None,"Social pressures are forcing people to cut back on their sleep, contributing to a "" global sleep crisis ,"" according to a new study based on research collected through a smartphone app.It enabled scientists from the University of Michigan to track sleep patterns around the world -- gathering data about how age, gender and the amount of natural light to which people are exposed affect sleep patterns in 100 countries -- and better understand how cultural pressures can override biological rhythms.""The effects of society on sleep remain largely unquantified,"" says the study published Friday in the journal Science Advances.""We find that social pressures weaken and/or conceal biological drives in the evening, leading individuals to delay their bedtime and shorten their sleep.""Lack of sleep is mostly affected by the time people go to bed, the study found.Middle-aged men get the least amount of sleep, less than the recommended seven to eight hours. And age is the main factor determining amount of sleep.The research is based on data collected through the free smartphone app Entrain, launched in 2014 to help users fight jetlag.Scientists asked some 6,000 people 15 and older to send anonymous data about sleep, wake-up and lighting environment, enabling the scientists to obtain a large amount of data about sleep patterns worldwide.The app also asks users to input information about their ages, gender, countries and time zones. Sleep is driven by an internal ""circadian"" clock, a cluster of 20,000 nerve cells the size of a grain of rice located behind the eyes, and adjusted according to the amount of light captured, especially natural light.The average amount of sleep in the world varies from a minimum of seven hours 24 minutes in Singapore and Japan to a maximum of eight hours 12 minutes in the Netherlands, the study found.Although a difference of 48 minutes may seem inconsequential, a lack of sleep for half an hour can have significant effects on cognitive function and health, the researchers said.People who need sleep suffer a reduction in their cognitive abilities without really being conscious of it, the new study says.""Impaired sleep presents an immediate and pressing threat to human health,"" it says. A recent report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found one in three American adults is not sleeping the recommended minimum of seven hours.Chronic lack of sleep increases the risk of obesity diabetes , hypertension and cardiovascular disease, according to the CDC.The new study also found that women sleep 30 minutes longer than men on average by going to bed earlier and rising later, and that people exposed longer to natural light every day often go to bed earlier.","['social', 'healthworld', 'seven', 'health', 'et', 'patterns', 'pressures', 'causing', 'minutes', 'data', 'study', 'natural', 'hours', 'light', 'sleep', 'global', 'crisis']","Social pressures are forcing people to cut back on their sleep, contributing to a "" global sleep crisis ,"" according to a new study based on research collected through a smartphone app.It enabled scientists from the University of Michigan to track sleep patterns around the world -- gathering data about how age, gender and the amount of natural light to which people are exposed affect sleep patterns in 100 countries -- and better understand how cultural pressures can override biological rhythms.
