One of the most successful ways of treating addicts is Alcoholics Anonymous programme,Today the T.T.

When Shanthi Ranganathan, a Madras housewife, decided to set up an exclusive centre for the treatment and rehabilitation of alcoholics five years ago, many people dismissed her efforts as the desperate actions of a grief-stricken wife. Her husband, an industrialist, had just died from alcoholism and Shanthi recalls: ""People thought I was crazy. They could not accept that alcoholism could be cured, and doctors warned me that it was a disease of only relapses and remissions."" But Shanthi was determined. She did a course in the US on the treatment of alcoholics and started a centre in her sprawling home on the quiet Santhome High Road in Madras.Today the T.T. Ranganathan Clinical Research Centre (TTRC) has grown into an institute of national repute and is the only one of its kind for treating alcoholics. Given the excellent cure rate of almost 60 per cent, the annual inflow of patients has gone up from 62 in 1981 to 320 last year.Before the centre was established, there were hardly any treatment facilities for the country's three million alcoholics, most of whom were admitted to the general wards of hospitals and treated for symptoms like jaundice or hallucinations. The centre's success lies in the fact that it offers treatment for the basic problem of alcoholism. It first admits patients to a nursing home for withdrawal symptoms like hallucinations, vomiting and severe shakes.Once the ""detoxification programme"" is over, patients undergo intensive individual and group therapy sessions. Surprisingly, most patients blame their problems on others. A bank manager undergoing treatment blamed his son who dropped out of college as the reason for his heavy drinking.The group therapy sessions help patients to confront their problems head on. In these sessions, recovering alcoholics narrate their problems, providing hope and making it easy for new patients to identify with them. Says psychologist Christina Chakravarthy: ""Group therapy helps in assuaging their guilt and releases their bottled-up feelings."" The patient is able to admit both to himself and others that he is an alcoholic.But to ensure that he does not yield to fresh temptation, the patient is put on a drug called Antabuse which causes a violent reaction if he consumes alcohol while on the course. The reactions could even result in death unless an antidote is administered within 24 hours.However, getting an alcoholic to admit that he is one and keeping him off liquor for a month is, as psychiatrist J.V. Devar puts it, ""only half the battle won"". The more difficult part is rehabilitating him so that he can start living a normal life. Most alcoholics have snapped ties with their family and friends and have probably lost their jobs too. One of the major hurdles psychiatrists face is in getting the family to be more understanding towards recovering alcoholics. This is easier said than done as the wife of a salesman-turned-alcoholic narrates. Her husband found that he hardly had any role to play at home because she did all the work and the children held back from him. To overcome these problems, the centre holds regular family counselling sessions where the families are taught how to cope with recovering alcoholics.While centres like TTRC may be difficult to replicate in the country, elsewhere, hospitals which have set up de-addiction clinics (and there are very few) have also been reporting encouraging results. One of them is the de-addiction centre run by the KEM Hospital in Bombay. Using a judicious combination of group therapy, individual counselling and an Antabuse course, the clinic reports that in the past two years it has been able to achieve a cure rate of 46 per cent. And in Bangalore, NIMHANS psychologists using aversion have reported an encouraging 45 per cent cure rate. Says psychologist V. Kumaraiah: ""We found that married people responded to treatment better than the rest, and the recovery rate was the highest among the older groups.But probably one of the most successful ways of treating addicts is the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) programme which is fast gaining popularity in the country. AA is a non-profit world-wide organisation of recovered alcoholics trying to help others in the same plight. There are already 100 such groups in the country, with Bombay alone boasting 55. Other cities with AA groups are Bangalore, Goa, Madras, Secunderabad, New Delhi, Cochin, Mangalore, Nagpur, Pune and Mysore.

AA members find that the group sessions help alcoholics to come to terms with their problems. In fact the first step for all AA members is to admit that ""we were powerless over alcohol, that our lives had become unmanageable"". The sessions also help other recovering alcoholics by constantly reminding them of their earlier plight. Said an a a member: ""By trying to help others we are actually motivating ourselves to keep away from liquor.""

For the families of alcoholics, the AA has a separate group called Al-Anon where members hold similar group therapy sessions. Rather than impose a set period of abstinence, the AA's golden rule for its members is: Get up every morning and tell yourself that you will remain sober for the next 24 hours. It seems to work.","['centre', 'help', 'aa', 'sessions', 'treatment', 'problems', 'patients', 'therapy', 'alcoholics', 'treating', 'successful', 'programme', 'anonymous', 'group', 'ways', 'addicts']","It first admits patients to a nursing home for withdrawal symptoms like hallucinations, vomiting and severe shakes.Once the ""detoxification programme"" is over, patients undergo intensive individual and group therapy sessions.

"Compounded by denial and loneliness, alcoholism among women becomes growing urban problem","Compounded by denial and a dearth of treatment centres, alcoholism anions women is a growing urban problem.",,2013-06-20T14:12:29+05:30,"More than anything else, this letter from her 11-year-old daughter put Priya Singh, a Delhi housewife, back on the road to sobriety. ""That was my rock-bottom. I decided that I had to do something about my alcoholism."" But after drinking heavily for almost two years - something that pushed her marriage to the brink - she knew getting back to normal wasn't going to be easy.

She visited a rehabilitation centre, and after several relapses finally succeeded in giving up alcohol altogether. Frequent attendance at the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings helped and Priya is beginning to pick up the broken pieces of her life. She is now reunited with her two children and is trying to make her marriage work.

In urban India, alcoholism has for long been regarded as a male affliction. Not any more, as psychiatrists in the country's metropolises report. What began as a trickle of female patients coming in for treatment is now a widening stream. An estimated three out of 10 alcoholics in many established clinics across the country are now women.

Unfortunately, only now is the problem being taken seriously. At the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) in Bangalore, the country's premier neurosciences research institute, around 10 female patients used to report for treatment every month just five years ago. Now, there are 30 to 35 every month and the institute has been forced to open a separate outpatient department for women alcoholics.

Explains Dr LA. Shariff, head of the Department of Psychiatric Social Welfare at NIMHANS: ""Nobody speaks or makes public this problem because, in the Indian situation, for a woman to be alcoholic is considered worse than being a prostitute or a criminal. There is social ostracism. So, the way most women cope with it is by hiding their problem.""

In Bombay, as the problem escalated, the Kripa Foundation, which has seven centres across the country for treating alcoholics and drug addicts, had to open a separate section for women. Part of the reason, according to Ossie Pereira, co-founder of the foundation, was that ""most alcoholics, men and women, haven't been able to handle sex normally. So if I had a mixed centre, I would have to start a maternity ward instead.""

And Dr D. Mohan, head of the Department of Psychiatry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), predicts that by the year 2000, overall India is likely to see one female alcoholic for every three male alcoholics - a ratio prevalent in the West today.

So, why exactly are women in India hitting the bottle in such alarming numbers? There is no clear answer. Research worldwide points a finger at a gene which could make alcoholism hereditary. Others talk of a certain percentage of people who are exposed to alcohol automatically becoming chemically dependent on it. For instance, the who estimates that one out of 25 people who drink will turn alcoholic as a result.

Part of the reason for the dramatic rise in women's dependency on alcohol is simple - they are now more exposed to alcohol socially than at any time in the recent past. It is no longer taboo for women to drink in public, and in parties it is the done thing. Confirms Rakesh Ghildiyal, Associate Professor of psychiatry at KEM, Bombay: ""Alcohol is a bigger problem among women than any other drug because it now has social sanction.""

Nowadays, three out of 10 alcoholics reporting for treatment in established clinics in Indian cities are women.

Others, like Delhi-based psychiatrist Dr Avdesh Sharma, feel that it could be modern-day problems which are driving women to alcoholism.

The most cited reason is stress. The balancing act required to keep a home and a career going has been known to take its toll. Conversely, a workaholic husband could lead to a depressed and lonely wife at home.

Rachna Sharma, 38, would agree. Three grown-up children meant more time in her hands and a loving but hopelessly busy husband had no time to fill that. The bottle provided the initial solace and then the addiction took over.

If loneliness is creeping stealthily into Indian lives as joint families - and even nuclear ones - break up, it is compounded by an increasing identity crisis faced by urbanised Indians. Are we as cool and hip as our western counterparts? Hot-shot marketing executive Sonia Malik, 40, wanted to be all that and more.

""I started drinking to deal with stress and to be in with the crowd."" The only problem was that her drinking continued well after everyone went home. And often, just as others were beginning their day - a pattern common among alcoholics.

Denial and lack of empirical data have led to the problem turning even more serious. Says Ashwini Ailawadi, an addiction counsellor in Delhi: ""We have this neat policy of denial. Indian women do not have sex, they don't have orgasms and they don't drink. We simply solve the problem by denial."" The issues a woman alcoholic faces are very different from what a man goes through - this needs to be addressed.

Her drinking is even more hidden than his, thus making it all the more difficult to detect. Says Sonia: ""I used to stay late in the office and drink secretly, but I was always very controlled in public - a woman has to be. I would fall apart the minute I reached home.""

Home, unfortunately, is not where the support system is anymore. Husbands could be alcoholics or, at the very least, the initiating party. At the other end of the scale could be an alcoholic parent hovering in the background. Rahul Khanna, 40, became the target of his wife's criticism about five years ago. Her complaint? That he drank too much.

In what she thought was an attempt at getting closer to him, Deepti, 35, too started drinking. ""We began to share a few drinks together and things began to look more cheerful."" she recalls. The cheer proved as short-lived as the fizz in a glass of beer. A truncated career and several violent fights later, the Khannas realised the severity of the problem.

Career and family life are not the only things at risk. Studies conducted in the US show that spontaneous abortions and early miscarriages are more likely to occur among alcoholic women.

Pregnant women in their first trimester are at a risk factor of 12 per cent even if they are modest drinkers. And the risk of congenital abnormalities is estimated to be as high as 32 per cent for women who are heavy drinkers. Worse, children are found to be more seriously affected by alcoholic mothers than fathers.

The problem also persists because there are no stereotypes, no target groups. And unfortunately, no safe groups either. At one end of the spectrum are groups like tribals and plantation workers, from whom come 48 per cent of women alcohol users.

Women in the weaker economic strata have always consumed alcohol. Now, there is the new addition of the middle classes, which could include anyone from a college student to a bored housewife. Says Karl Sequeria, joint director of the Bangalore-based Freedom Foundation, a rehabilitation centre: ""I find that more and more young college-going women are drinking heavily, a cause for grave concern.""

Why Treatment is Tough





Alcohol is often abused, with prescription pills making it a deadly cocktail.

Complete lack of rehabilitation centres and support groups.

Families are rarely supportive.

So, while recognition is often myopic, treatment runs into a blind alley.

Women face specific guilt trips and problems but rehabilitation centres and support groups are dominated by, and are often for, men.

Rape, manipulation and sexual baiting are all part of a woman alcoholic's routine.

With such a negative gender background, a woman with this problem finds it difficult to enter a predominantly male group. Even an immensely successful support group like AA faces this problem. There is now a crying need for separate rehabilitation centres for women, like the one NIMHANS has begun.

The silver lining to this dark cloud is that sobriety gives recovering women alcoholics an unparalleled high. Every experience is savoured with a new enthusiasm and talk of a new life.

Sonia, who was considered dead for all practical and financial reasons, is today at the centre of all family decisions. Priya is the emotional anchor for her two teenage children. Most of them further the cause of sobriety by keeping their doors open to fellow alcoholics.

Is the 12-step programme any good for sex addiction?,,,2010-09-08T15:11:36+05:30,"Vaccine benefits elude older women







Vitamin B helps the brain



American researchers have found that vitamin B3, or niacin, a common water- soluble vitamin, can "" rewire"" the brain by improving blood vessels in patients. Rats with ischemic stroke given niacin "" sprouted"" nerve cells, which greatly improved their neurological functions. Scientists said this finding could result in the development of a new low cost treatment for stroke patients. The results of this study may also open doors in other areas of neurological medicine, including brain injury. Past studies into B vitamins have indicated that they can help to prevent heart attacks and strokes.





How much is too much, and when does any habit become ""excessive"", be this eating, drinking, shopping or sex? The answer, say therapists, lies in whether this behaviour damages your life in any way. It was Clinton who first offered us a glimpse of how sex can ruin a person's life. More recently, Tiger Woods's string of sexual escapades has confirmed this idea that 'out of control' sexual behaviour which seems addictive can have far-reaching consequences.Sex addiction is being recognised as a problem the world over but in the Indian context, very little research has been done on this problem and its treatment. Experts say that this is because sex is still a taboo subject in our culture. ""Ours is a predominantly patriarchal society in which a sexual problem or addiction is considered an affront to masculinity so a man suffering from sex addiction is simply hailed as 'virile',"" says Dr Rachna Singh, consultant psychologist, Artemis Health Institute.Undoubtedly sex addiction has to be defined carefully as a person might have a high libido, nothing more, and his sexual needs might not match his partners, which leads to him being branded unfairly as an addict. ""There are no clear cut lines to define what too much sex is. If a man with a high libido finds a match in his partner then there is no problem. But when the desire to have sex takes over a person's life and renders it dysfunctional, then the psychological and physical condition should be analysed,"" says Dr Wadia.While the idea that anyone can be addicted to sex is still scoffed at, using this as a 'medical' excuse for promiscuous behavior makes the matter more controversial. Especially since this is not even recognised as a disorder by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), considered the psychiatrist's Bible and ""hypersexual disorder"" is under consideration for the next edition.Woods recently offered a public apology for his infidelity, saying he was returning to his religious faith and admitting that he had ""work to do."" This declaration appeared to be in the line of the steps advocated by a de-addiction programme called the 12-step approach. This universally-accepted plan was first formulated by Alcoholics Anonymous and has since then been adopted by Narcotics Anonymous, Sex Addicts Anonymous and groups for gambling, food and shopping addictions. Alcoholics Anonymous is the largest of all the twelve-step programs, followed by Narcotics Anonymous.Woods's apology last week to his family and his wife's family, his business partners and sponsors, and parents who ""used to point to me as a role model for their kids,"" seemed to be in line with steps 8 and 9 of the programme, which advocate listing everyone harmed and the making of amends.The 12-step is intended to provide psychological, social and spiritual support for addicts. Crucial to this is the admission that their addiction isn't in their control and that there is a greater power that can give strength. Past mistakes are rectified with the help of a sponsor who is an experienced member. The final step is to learn to live a new life with a new code of behaviour and help others who suffer from the same addictions or compulsions. ""We use many of the principles of the 12-step in our counselling ,"" declares Elizabeth Selhore, director of Sahara, an NGO that runs a rehabilitation programme for drug and alcohol addiction. Selhore admits that while sex addiction is not "" acknowledged"" in India, it is a problem nonetheless. ""Anything can become an addiction, including love and sex.""Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and counselling are typically used to deal with addictive behaviour. According to Dr Samir Malhotra, HOD psychiatry at Fortis Noida, people with addictions avoid seeking professional help. ""Groups like AA are not very active. But many elements of the 12-step programme are a part of recovery programmes, even though people may not follow the exact 12 steps. Systems of recovery vary and the patient's personality and circumstances as well as environment needs to be evaluated especially where sex addiction is concerned,"" says Malhotra.The pros and cons of the 12-step are debatable. One of the biggest advantages is the sense of community and belonging that it offers those struggling with addiction. It destigmatises addiction and helps a person accept responsibility for their dependence on drugs, alcohol or sex. Following the plan costs nothing and a person can count on it.One of the arguments against the programme is that it focuses on the emotional and spiritual, and neglects the physical. ""But that's why it's important to create your own plan based on some of the principles only,"" counters Selhore. Sahara's plan includes vigorous physical activity and the NGO has its own football team which competes in country level tournaments.Calling yourself an addict is essential in the 12-step plan. This admission is hard for some, as is the social involvement that is part of the plan. Many people struggling with addiction find this hard to deal with as it makes them uncomfortable or nervous. The public confessional approach is another area of the programme that may make people cringe. Some feel that the need for belief in a Higher Power which is integral for those following the plan also comes in the way of its universal applicability and efficacy. Selhore doesn't agree though. ""The programme talks of God or a Higher Power but doesn't give any name to this power, so it's applicable to everyone and it doesn't matter whether you are a Christian or Hindu.""","['power', 'addiction', 'plan', 'problem', 'life', 'sexual', 'good', 'sex', 'programme', 'selhore', '12step']","This declaration appeared to be in the line of the steps advocated by a de-addiction programme called the 12-step approach.

The Buzz: Who, What, Why

Moni Dutta is not on the model list, but is Raghavendra Rathore's in-house muse during IFW. The Assamese beauty has just returned from a European stint.



India Shining sun tan India Shining sun tan

Is fashion getting smarter as designers try to get attention? An ""India Shining"" sun tan bottle is part of Kiran Uttam Ghosh's press kit.



First Timers

After the discovery of Sabyasachi, new designers are watched closely. Varun Bahl's diffusion line, with detailed embellishments, should be well attended for a debut.



Despite the noise designers make, there remains a strong suspicion that audiences turn up to watch not the clothes, but those they hang on.The model is the weakest link in the commerce of fashion, yet she is the most visible. Models epitomise what Christian Dior famously called the ""New Look"". They are a reflection of, for what it's worth, what ""beauty"" will be in vogue next.Fashion projection has, at different times, glamorised, objectified, celebrated and humiliated women. The supermodel on the international runway was haughty and untouchable.At the peak of the Tom Ford nightclubber days, she wore hideously expensive clothes, but still managed to look dirty. Gianni Versace invented hooker chicon his runway, which was followed by the darker days of John Galliano when women were objects of fetish fantasies.

On Indian runways, the couture years saw the rise of the touch-me-not, aloof, exotic supermodel. In the recent pret past, the bad boys of fashion brought her down to earth. Often with a thud.



Manish Arora gave her the ""socked eye look"" in the early days of the India Fashion Week (IFW) when in runny overused mascara, she walked down the rampas if she was on her way to Alcoholics Anonymous.



So what's the look of the Lakme India Fashion Week, which begins this year on April 27? According to most experts, it is a complicated one. ""The look swings between extremes of reality and extremes of fantasy,"" says stylist Yatin Ahluwalia who, along with partner Jojo, works on the runway look at IFW.



Unlike the nude lipstick-wearing, straight-haired, natural, if vacuous Kaif beauty, she is still cheerful, but a lot more cerebral. She is part goddess, part goof. She is mostly happy, but can bite. She is Indian, but could live anywhere. She is a whole package, rather than a part.



""It's a sophisticated cheeriness. The best way to put it would be beauty with a twist,"" says Ahluwalia. Part of it reflects the sartorial adventure that Indian designers are on. While being steeped in Indian craft and textiles in fabric and technique, they are combining many elements in their work.



Ashish Soni is influenced by Zen, Rahul Khanna and Rohit Gandhi are inspired by the Sloane Ranger English tweeds, while Morocco seems to be coming up in the works of designers as diverse as Ranna Gill and Ashima-Leena.



""This is a woman who cannot be contained in definitions, she has her own opinions and ideas of style, but unlike the 1980s power dresser of the West, she is much less aggressive and severe in her attitude,"" says Ahluwalia.



Dishevelled hair is in, rather than the combed-to-the-scalp neatness of the past year. The mouth is asking for attention, rebelling against the nude tone niceties of the recent past.

The eyes are defined once more. While retro chic also returns to international runways- Galliano led the look with his ""grannies from hell"", over-painted models inspired by the '50s, headed for a naughty night out-some insist that good old world glamour fits in just as well in the Indian context.



Raghavendra Rathore, a designer more in the classic mould, says, ""As malls mushroom and retail and real estate join hands to create more room for fashion, the industry is riding on their own version of feel-good. Fashion is celebrating sophistication and good old dressing up is nothing to be ashamed of."" His model, he says, will be the classic Indian beauty of the '50s' Bollywood, but scratch the surface and there is a raunchy diva just waiting to get out.





Runway Tips

Ringlets and texturing are big. Throw out the straighteners. Orange, pink and other colours replace nude in lipstick. The eyes are defined again. Blended two-tone colour is hot. Use sheen, gleam and glow. Translucent is back.

Arora, with his penchant for the over-the-top, will exaggerate the same theme. The hair will be voluminous enough to house a bird's nest, the mouth will be inviting red. This woman enjoys attention. ""There is an aggressive sexiness with a hint of stylishness,"" says Arora.But according to him, it is the subdued nightclub sensibility of Tokyo rather than the sluttiness of New York. ""She is sensual, but mischievous and romantic as well."" Her clothes fit the look: contemporary silhouettes with prints inspired by newborn babies, cartoons and romantic roses.The twist shows up again with fellow shocker Narula. ""She wears chiffon slipdresses with velvet track pants. Her look reflects this contradiction: she is pretty, but not too pretty, she is chic but fun, and she is all these things at the same time."" While Kumar did well as the blank bombshell, designers say she has enough mystery and mischief for the new look.The model who is on top of the heap, charging Rs 18,000 per show, will continue to be a show-opener by all accounts. Insiders say Michelle Innes too can suit the role, as can former Miss India, the now-nice-now moody Poonam Nath.Jesse Randhawa's has-she-got-ants-inher-pants excitability might be too strong for the look and last year's favourite Bhawna Sharma may be too full of fun to be every man's fantasy. For more, just wait for the frontrow view.","['twist', 'model', 'shining', 'designers', 'look', 'india', 'set', 'fashion', '2004', 'week', 'indian', 'beauty', 'runway', 'fantasy']","India Shining sun tan India Shining sun tanIs fashion getting smarter as designers try to get attention?

"Alcoholism in India acquires alarming overtones, makes dangerous inroads in society","Unobtrusively, alcoholism in India has suddenly acquired alarming overtones. Recent surveys have produced statistical findings that illustrate the dangerous inroads alcoholism has already made in Indian society and with what devastating effect.",,2014-01-27T15:52:09+05:30,"Pour yourself your favourite drink. Sit down, loosen your shoe laces and relax. Take a large swig. Feel the warmth flow into your system. Let the surge of confidence envelope you. Then answer these questions:

Do you prefer to drink alone?

Do you drink daily? Does drinking spoil your sleep?

Do you drink to bolster your confidence?

Is drinking affecting your work?

Is your family affected by it?

Have you ever had a black-out?



If you have answered yes to any three of these questions then it's bad news. You are either an alcoholic or well on your way to becoming one. Worried? Then push your glass firmly away and listen. You are not the only one.



A tidal wave of alcoholism is engulfing the country. While in the sixties one in 300 drinkers were alcoholics now become addicts.



At exactly 7 p.m. every Saturday in the annexe building of a church on the busy Parliament Street in New Delhi, 20-odd people sit around a hexagonal table lit by candles.

Among them are salesmen, businessmen, armed forces officers, government officials, factory workers and even a doctor. As the meeting progresses each one narrates how alcohol has destroyed his life. Choking with emotion, Mathew, a copy-writer in an advertising agency, says: ""After a drunken bout I was like an animal. I messed my pants, vomited on the floor and crawled on the floor, unable to pick myself up.""

A tremendous feeling of empathy builds as the session ends, because each understands the others' sorrows, and many of those present weep openly. The meeting is typical of those held regularly across the country by 100 such Alcoholics Anonymous groups, a rapidly growing organisation of ex-drinkers trying to reform addicts.



A different kind of scene is being enacted in a white-tiled room at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore. Krishnappa, a 38-year-old coffee planter, has his left arm strapped to a 40-volt transformer and is given a glass of whisky. As soon as he takes a sip he is given a mild shock that makes him grimace in pain. This aversion therapy is designed to make Krishnappa's psyche reject alcohol. Krishnappa started drinking when he was 16 and today he does little other than drink. His disgusted wife brought him for treatment last month.

In more homely surroundings inside a sprawling house in Madras, Swaminathan, a 55-year-old former bank manager, struggles with a picture puzzle given to him by psychologists at the T.T. Ranganathan Clinical Research Centre (TTRC) in Madras. The puzzle is designed to test how badly Swaminathan's brain has been damaged by alcohol. Swaminathan never drank when he was young, and was introduced to liquor after he was promoted as regional manager in the bank and forced to attend 'wet' parties. Soon he was hooked. At home he became irritable and constantly abused his wife, throwing the food she served and breaking crockery. His drinking affected his son so badly that he dropped out of college.Mathew, Krishnappa and Swaminathan are only the froth on a tidal wave of alcoholism engulfing the country. And there is a cask-full of statistics to prove the point. In the '60s only one in 300 drinkers was considered an alcoholic. Then the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported that by 1980 an estimated three million - or one in 25 - of the 80 million Indians who consume alcohol had become severely addicted.Last year the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) surveyed the problem in four regions - Bangalore, Delhi. Dibrugarh and Ranchi. lt found that 20 per cent of urban consumers had become totally dependent on it, while in villages the figure went as high as 30 to 40 per cent. Davinder Mohan, who coordinated the ICMR survey and heads the Department of Psychiatry at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi, says: ""Alcohol is already taking a heavy toll in the country. It's soon going to be evident even to a blind person.""The toll, in fact, has already become starkly evident: In major hospitals alcoholics now form 20 to 30 per cent of the patients in psychiatric wards when five years ago they constituted only 0.2 per cent. In Bombay's KEM Hospital, which treated 309 patients in the past two years, sociologist Hema Shah says: ""Initially we got people only from the slum areas. But soon bank officers, managers, factory workers and even government officers started coming for treatment. The middle class too seems to be affected in a big way.""

Last year's ICMR study indicated that half the industrial workers surveyed drink regularly, and companies report that alcoholism has become one of the major causes of absenteeism and falling productivity. At Ashok Leyland in Madras, for instance, managers estimate that atleast 500 of the company's 7,500 workers are problem drinkers. Says Executive Director J. Joseph: ""We used to have 10 per cent absenteeism, but now we find it going up to 22 per cent and we think alcoholism has a great deal to do with it.""Alcohol is a major cause of broken marriages. Relationships with wives were seriously disrupted in 64 per cent of the alcoholics. In Bombay, Bagashri Parikh, a marriage counsellor at the city court, says that one out of 10 divorces is because of alcoholic husbands and adds:' 'Most of the alcoholics beat their wives regularly.""The country's road research institutes estimate that 25 per cent of road accidents are alcohol-related and that a third of the drivers on the highway are under the influence of alcohol. In Delhi, when the AIIMS did a study of accident victims suffering from head injuries, it found that 20 per cent had consumed alcohol.Surveying the damage Hira Singh, director. National Institute of Social Defence (NISD), the Union Welfare Ministry's striking arm against drug abuse, says: ' 'There is no doubt that alcohol is the most widely abused drug in the country."" That's certainly true. Alcoholism has traditionally been associated with the tribal areas in the country, where people brew their own liquor.

Then the problem spread to the hilly areas and the northeast, and to industrial townships and the coalfields. Now other areas too have got ensnared, hitting people from all walks of life: professionals, businessmen, industrial workers, government servants, armed forces officers and farmers.

The statistics reveal that most of the patients (98 per cent) are predominantly male, and usually in the prime of their lives at 25 years and above. A majority are married and have children. In most cases they are the only bread-winners in the family. ""It's hitting the most productive section of our society and is creating havoc,"" says psychiatrist J.V. Devar in Madras.



Researchers are hard put to explain the dramatic rise in alcoholism in a country that has prohibition enshrined as a Directive Principle of the Constitution. But prohibition as a policy has been steadily given up by one state after another, and liquor is now as easily available as tea leaves in most parts of the country. Alcohol consumption, inevitably, has gone up quite dramatically. In 1976, liquor manufacturers used up 169.4 million litres of pure alcohol, enough to manufacture 350 million bottles of rum.

But despite tough measures by the puritanical Janata government and the Congress(I)'s resolve to hold production at the 1981 level of 207.9 million litres, the consumption of pure alcohol climbed to 331 million litres last year - sufficient to produce 1,134 million bottles of rum!Indians now have more than 200 brands of whisky, 50 brands of rum, 30 kinds of brandy, 10 brands of gin, 15 of wine, 50 beers and a couple of hundred varieties of country liquor to choose from. ""People have become more brand conscious and are willing to pay more for better quality liquor these days,"" says Ravi Jain, general manager of McDowells, a subsidiary of United Breweries, which is among the big five in the liquor business. McDowells has registered a 10 per cent growth every year.That Indians are drinking more than ever before is evident by their revolutionary change in attitudes towards drinking. The traditional taboo against liquor is rapidly vanishing. More and more homes serve liquor to guests, 'dry' parties are considered boring, and traditional festivals like Ganesh Chaturthi, Diwali and Holi are used as excuses to go on drinking bouts.

Salesmen and businessmen prefer to do business over lunch lined with liquor. Among youngsters, to drink is to be manly. ""We are becoming more of an alcoholised society,"" says psychiatrist Rajat Ray of NIMHANS. And in Lucknow, psychiatrist B.B. Sethi says: ""A house not serving liquor is now an exception.""



Drinking in bars, once the haunt of only the hardened alcoholic, has gained increasing acceptance. In the outskirts of Patna. for instance, roadside bhattis, the poor man's bars, have become popular drinking places. One of them on the bypass road to Patna is a huge, sprawling dimly-lit shack reeking with the stench of liquor, rotten fish and frying eggs. Around 250 people, among them teenagers, sit around in groups chatting and shouting. They come from all social groups - rickshaw-pullers, factory workers, professionals and even police constables in civilian dress. Babu Lalrai, 35, a tailor, chirps up:' 'Yes, I drink daily and go to the Ganga for a holy dip daily.""



The wave of alcoholism is by no means confined to the cities. While the sale of country liquor in most states has risen slowly, this masks the fact that people have increasingly moved to cheaper, illicit liquor because even country liquor costs as much as Rs 8 for a bottle. In Bangalore, arrack king H.R. Basavaraj estimates that ""illicit liquor sales equal that of country liquor"". The repetitive liquor tragedies testify to this. In Bangalore more than 300 people died of liquor poisoning in 1981. The next year in the island of Vypeen in Kerala, 72 people were killed. On an average more than 200 people are killed in the country from liquor poisoning every year.



Youngsters drinking: vulnerable age Youngsters drinking: vulnerable age

What worries many psychiatrists is the widespread acceptance of beer and the current boom in beer sales. In Maharashtra, beer sales have jumped from 14 million bottles to 24 million bottles in the last five years. And in West Bengal, more beer is consumed than whisky, rum and brandy put together; last year's beer sales totalled 12 million bottles.

But if people regard beer as some kind of milk product, the harsh truth is that one bottle of beer has about the same alcohol content as a peg of whisky, and psychiatrists say that beer drinking not only opens the floodgates for more potent liquor but is addictive and in the long run can do as much damage as whisky or rum.



The splurge in drinking is reflected in the high per capita consumption of liquor. While the annual per capita consumption of alcohol by adults in India hovers around one litre of pure alcohol (equivalent to two-and-a-half bottles of rum), a little lower than Australia's 1.5 and a lot less than the US's 4.1, this figure is misleading. Unlike Australia and the US, women in India hardly drink.



So if only the male population's consumption is calculated, the figure jumps to around two litres of pure alcohol. And if only the drinking male population is taken into account, the figure is as high as 4.1, or 10 bottles of rum per head annually: high enough for the alarm bells to be ringing. Even this excludes the millions of litres of illicit liquor that goes down parched gullets. And in states like Punjab, the per capita consumption is 6.5 litres of pure alcohol, or 16 bottles of rum.



All drinkers are not drunkards. So when does a normal drinker turn alcoholic? The popular concept of the drunk is one who falls into gutters or staggers around on streets mouthing obscenities. But that, say psychiatrists, is only the last stages of alcoholism. A social drinker becomes a problem one when, according to Shanthi Ranganathan of TTRC: ""His drinking starts affecting on a continuous basis his health, his job efficiency and his relations with his family and friends."" The who estimates that one out of 10 drinkers turns alcoholic.



Most drinkers do not realise when they have crossed the thin red line between social drinking and alcoholism. In Madras, Udayakumar, 37, a former packing manufacturer, thought he had his drinking well under control till one day he realised that ""a quarter of a bottle of rum was a mosquito bite"". In Bangalore, a salesman remembers that while initially he could hardly hold a peg of whisky he suddenly found himself going on long drinking bouts.



Says he: ""Every cell in my body craved for alcohol and when I took a drink it was like setting off a nuclear reaction. I didn't stop drinking till I became unconscious."" And in Bombay, a factory supervisor initially started drinking during week-ends with friends. Then, as he says, ""after a while I drank once in three days, then every alternate day, then every day and then every hour"".



Researchers now agree that alcoholism is a disease, because alcoholics exhibit predictable symptoms and suffer the same physical and mental trauma: severe shakes, damage to vital organs like the heart and liver, and psychological breakdown. Society, which always dismissed alcoholics as weak-willed or immoral people, is only now reluctantly beginning to accept this home truth.

In Bangalore, Malavika, a 30-year-old management consultant married to a lawyer, confesses: ""I thought all drunkards were bums till my husband became an alcoholic. Initially I was bewildered and thought he drank because he was not happy with me. But I soon realised that although he desperately wanted to give up alcohol he couldn't. It was as though he had caught a disease.""



Once the disease catches on it moves with terrifying rapidity, reducing its victims to physical, mental and moral wrecks. Try as they will, they find it impossible to kick the habit even though they know that it is steadily destroying their lives. A Bombay naval officer remembers with tears how he tied his favourite Labrador and whipped it mercilessly in a drunken fit.

The next morning the dog seemed to forget the beating and wagged its tail, but he was so insane that he whipped it again. Mathew, the Delhi copy-writer, remembers how he threw up a Rs 5,000 job in a leading advertising agency when he quarrelled with his employer over a trivial matter.



Probably the most damaging effect of this wave of alcoholism, according to a doctor, is that ""not only the drinker but everyone in the family suffers. Alcoholism is a family disease."" As the alcoholic becomes more and more obnoxious, the wife and children get seriously affected. Malavika, the lawyer's wife, recalls the traumatic experience when guests dropped in one morning and found her husband lying on the floor dead drunk.

The naval commander's wife once tried to jump out of a fourth floor window after he slapped her in a drunken rage. Children too are badly affected. In a typical case in Bangalore, Arun, 17, whose father has been a chronic alcoholic, dropped out of school and took to drugs and alcohol. In fact studies abroad indicate that alcoholism could also be a familial disease, with children of alcoholics being more prone to becoming alcoholics themselves.



If more families have not broken up, it is because most Indian wives fear the stigma attached to divorce. Last fortnight Malathi, 38, the wife of a former supervisor in a printing press and mother of five children, came to social workers at the Maharashtra State Women's Council for help. Her husband had beaten her so badly that her cheek and shoulder were blue-black.



She said her husband had lost his job because of his drinking, and when she wanted to take up a job her husband refused to allow her and suspected her fidelity. Her eldest son had become a vagrant and a petty thief. But when the council suggested she divorce her husband. she flatly refused. Says the council's social worker Anila Merchant: ""For most sufferers marriage provides some form of security.""



A just-published study of workers at the Madras Port Trust, done by sociologist Saraswathi Sankaran, shows how damaging alcohol can be. Of the 162 workers surveyed, more than half of them drank heavily, and a third were addicts.



Sankaran compared the work performance of the drinkers and non-drinkers and was stunned to find that the heavy drinkers were absent every sixth working day. As a result, the non-drinkers took home 50 per cent more money than the drinkers, spent8 per cent more on food, 30 per cent more on clothing, 168 per cent more on health care and a whopping 300 per cent more on children's education. Says Sankaran: ""Whether it is poverty, malnutrition, marital disharmony or delinquent children, alcohol seems to have been the major cause of all their miseries.'' While alcoholism and its related problems increase alarmingly, progress on the treatment of sufferers has been tardy.



Most alcoholics find that doctors treat the problem as a moral issue. Said one alcoholic: ""My whole world had crumbled, and here was this doctor telling me I must develop the will power to stop drinking."" Only now are hospitals recognising alcoholism as a major problem and setting up specialised clinics for treatment (see box). As a consequence, there are facilities for treating hardly 3,000 of the estimated three million alcoholics in the country.



But even hospitals that have clinics are faced with problems like the lack of professionally trained staff.



The problem is compounded by the fact that most alcoholics do not get themselves treated till at a very late stage, because most people do not like to admit they have an alcoholic in their family and try to conceal the fact as long as possible. A factory supervisor in Bombay, who had been an alcoholic for five years, first tried to give up drinking himself.

When that failed his wife sent him to the local mantravadi to exorcise the spirit that seemed to have possessed him. It was only when he was admitted to the KEM Hospital with an attack of jaundice that he learnt the hospital had a de-addiction programme. Infact, most of the patients usually go to hospital when they have serious health problems such as cirrhosis of the liver or fits of delirium.



If the psychiatrists find it difficult to cope with the problem, the Government seems equally helpless. The state governments, which control alcohol supply and distribution, indirectly encourage people to drink more because revenue from excise forms a major part of the income of most states. In Karnataka liquor is the second biggest money-spinner for the state, netting Rs 50 crore last year, while in Tamil Nadu it accounts for a good 8 per cent of the revenue. Total liquor sales in the country would amount to something like Rs 3,000 crore, and liquor companies form a powerful lobby group.



Ironically, although the Constitution has made prohibition a Directive Principle, the states have made only feeble attempts to make prohibition effective policy. Most governments in fact have given up prohibition altogether. Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, which had imposed prohibition at different times, ran into trouble and were forced to relax their rules.



Tamil Nadu needed the excise revenue to run its midday meal scheme. Maharashtra, which strangely enough has placed prohibition and excise under the same department, is quite happy counting the take from liquor sales while running a prohibition programme to educate people on the evils of drinking. Bihar was forced to lift prohibition after a large number of people died in of illicit liquor in the Dhanbad coalfields. Right now Gujarat is the only state where prohibition is enforced, but liquor is still easily available and the policy is commonly seen as a farce.



Wiser from these experiences. many states have set up temperance boards in the fond hope that if they cannot prevent people from drinking they can convince them to drink moderately. But most of these boards do little more than release advertisements in newspapers showing a bottle marked with the familiar skull and crossbones.



With governments unable to curb the menace, people have taken matters into their own hands. In distant Imphal in Manipur, women were so disgusted with their men folk's excessive drinking that they formed themselves into an association against drunkards and kept vigil at nights in front of liquor shops and bars. Any drunkard they catch is publicly humiliated by making him walk with a string of bottles tied around his neck, and then handed over to the police. In the hills of Uttar Pradesh and tribal areas of Bihar similar people's movements have met with notable success in an area where drunkenness has become a major social problem.



Mean while, to formulate fresh strategies against drinking and drug abuse, the Welfare Ministry two years ago set up a working group chaired by its joint secretary. This is likely to stress education programmes on the evils of drinking. As Rajendra Kumari Bajpai, minister of state for welfare says: ""A stroke of the pen, like imposing a total ban, is not going to help. If we have to bring alcoholism under control we need to use persuasion, create awareness and show a strong determination to implement our programmes.""



But with both the Central and state governments failing to make a serious dent in the two vital factors that the who says leads to an increase in alcoholism - easy availability and increasing demand for alcohol - the battle of the bottle may be well and truly lost.","['alarming', 'million', 'makes', 'society', 'dangerous', 'alcoholic', 'overtones', 'inroads', 'drinking', 'cent', 'country', 'alcoholics', 'drink', 'india', 'alcoholism', 'acquires', 'liquor', 'alcohol']","In 1976, liquor manufacturers used up 169.4 million litres of pure alcohol, enough to manufacture 350 million bottles of rum.

New Delhi, Aug 3 (PTI) In a unique initiative, Delhi Police have started weekly sessions for its personnel struggling with alcoholism, in which they learn to deal with the problem from those who have beaten the addiction and now working with Alcoholics Anonymous.

""The entire programme, comprising of three stages, was launched one-and-half months ago,"" said Suman Nalwa DCP and Principal of Police Training School, Dwarka.

So far, six districts have been covered. Experts from Alcoholics Anonymous share their own experience and ways that helped them get rid of the addiction, she said.

In the coming weeks, such sessions will be held in all 11 police districts to cover over 76,000 personnel of the force. Delhi Polices largest wing, the Police Control Room (PCR), comprising nearly 10,000 personnel, is currently organising the sessions held on Saturdays.

""People feel that alcohol is harming them, their family and social life but do not know how to give it up. Also, many dont know what alcoholism means,"" Nalwa said.

""The initiative is aimed at helping those struggling with alcoholism and also create awareness among the police force so that they can tackle alcohol-related problems like street violence and domestic disputes in a more effective manner,"" she said.

The DCP said the sessions held so far have registered good participation and police personnel come out with very revealing questions and information during the interactions.

The whole programme of fighting alcoholism involves three steps. In the first step, the participants are made aware of alcoholism and what it means. In the second and third steps, they and the family members interact with the experts.

Also, those struggling with alcoholism are educated about 12 facts related to alcoholism which help them in getting rid of the problem, Nalwa said.

'Alcohol has ruined my life',Maben became a chronic alcoholic and began sleeping with a bottle under his pillow. He started absenting himself from work regularly. His increments and promotions were stopped.,,2014-01-27T16:20:01+05:30,"Maben: back from the brink Maben: back from the brink

49, a machine operator in a Bangalore factory, began drinking heavily 15 years ago after he was superseded at work and his youngest son, Dinakar, died the same year. Maben recalls: ""At work I had no peace and at home I was unhappy. Booze was the only way I could forget my sorrows."" Instead it brought him more.

Maben became a chronic alcoholic and began sleeping with a bottle under his pillow. He started absenting himself from work regularly. His increments and promotions were stopped.



With liquor burning up all his money, Maben was invariably broke. His favourite clarinet, guitar and camera found their way to the local pawn shop, as did his wife Evelyn's jewellery, including her mangalsutra. The worst came when he was evicted from his rented two-bedroom house. Arun, his son, remembers that incident with a shudder and says: ""I can never forget how ashamed I was. All our furniture and clothes were lying on the footpath. I just ran to my friend's house and hid.""



Someone suggested that he send Rs 50 to St Francis Xavier's tomb in Goa, but that did not help. Nor did money sent to Tirupati Temple, or consulting a Mantravadi, who made him wear a charm around his waist and charged him Rs 1,000 for his pains. He was admitted to NIMHANS as many as 18 times for treatment, and the doctors refused to admit him any more.



Frustration and desperation drove him to drink a bottle of varnish last year, which nearly killed him. After that he vowed to give up drinking and over a period of one year, Maben's transformation has been dramatic. He has started doing yoga, which helps him sleep well. He goes to work regularly.



At home things have improved considerably, and Evelyn now goes shopping with him - something they had not done for years. Every Sunday all of them sing bhajans at a nearby spiritual centre. Daughter Chandrika says: ""There is so much peace at home now.""



Narayan, 44, a peon in a bank in Madurai is not so happy. An alcoholic for the past 10 years, Narayan was brought in a delirious state to the TTRC for treatment last month. His office had suspended him for coming drunk to work and warned him that unless he gave up drinking they would dismiss him.



While Narayan is still unable to speak coherently about his addiction, his wife Malini, who faced the brunt of his drunken bouts, has a sorry tale to narrate. She remembers that initially when Narayan drank she thought he was just trying to forget his worries. But soon he was coming home drunk every day, beating her regularly, and always in a foul mood. He threw away the food she made for him, he was nasty with the children and prevented them from studying at night. He did not give her money and pawned all her jewellery.



She was forced to take up work as domestic help to feed the children. And when her children worried her for money to see films, she told them sharply: ""Your father is taking my life out of me, now you don't start."" The office suspended Narayan several times, but Malini used to go and fall at the bank manager's feet and beg for mercy. Meanwhile Narayan became so weak that according to Malini ""he is now only eyes and stomach. I don't know how much longer he would live.""



Anand, 33, unlike Narayan who has not yet lost his job, finds his life has been completely shattered and is only now beginning to pick up the pieces. Anand has been an alcoholic for the past 13 years. Last year his wife walked out on him, taking their two children with her. Immediately after that he lost his job as a sales executive in a Delhi travel agency.



Anand, the son of an air force officer, started drinking when in his second year at college in Nagpur. Since his father was in the armed forces, drinking was considered normal. Anand found himself increasingly attending parties where liquor was served and he says: ""I used to be the first to start drinking and the last to leave. I had a tremendous capacity, and even if I had five large pegs I would never get drunk."" After graduation, his job as a sales executive offered even more opportunities to drink and, as he puts it: ""It was an ideal job for an alcoholic, became a 24-hour drinker.""



For a while he thought he could handle his liquor and he made sure that his work was not affected. When his wife, a doctor, told him to give up drinking, he said: ""I thought she was a bloody nag and I used to get the feeling that the whole world was after my blood."" Soon he became irregular at work and extremely irritable at home, hitting his wife once in anger.

That's when she left him. He was forced to give up his job because, as he says: ""I couldn't handle two careers at one time: my drinking and my job."" Last year he touched rock bottom:' 'I had become like a caged tiger. I didn't know how to escape and all I did was hide myself in the bottle."" He finally joined an Alcoholics Anonymous group in Delhi, and now he says: ""My obsession is gone. But I'm not going to take up a job till I'm fully recovered.""

32, a packer in a Bombay firm, has had equally traumatic experiences with alcohol. Living in a dirty slum in Ghatkopar, David, who looks older than his age, is slowly recovering from the damaging effects of alcohol. His speech is still slurred and he gropes for words. His hands tremble uncontrollably. Doctors attending on him say his brain has suffered some damage and it may be a year before he is able to recover.David, who is married and has two children, remembers that he started drinking when he was around 15 years old: ""At that time we drank because after a hard day's work we had nothing to do and we wanted to forget the strain of living."" Initially he drank only on week-ends, but: ""After some time all I did was to drink, drink and sleep.''

He refused to go to work, and last year was absent for 140 days. His office sent him a charge-sheet, which he ignored. His entire pay packet of Rs 1,000 went towards liquor:' 'I used to be so desperate that I even sold my shoes and shirt."" His wife left him twice to go and live with her father.

"Simon Pegg talks about his struggle with alcoholism, depression",,,2018-07-10T11:52:00+05:30,"London Jul 10 (PTI) Actor Simon Pegg has opened up about his struggle with depression and alcoholism, saying that he checked into a rehabilitation centre to seek recovery.

The 48-year-old actor said while he was shooting ""Mission: Impossible III"" in 2006, he was ""fairly lost, and unhappy, and an alcoholic"".

""It was awful, terrible,"" he told The Guardian while talking about his struggle. ""It owned me.""

""When I watch that film back, I can see where I was then, which was fairly lost, and unhappy, and an alcoholic,"" Pegg added.

The actor said he ""micro managed"" his condition for quite some time, till the ball dropped.

""One thing (addiction) does is make you clever at not giving anything away. People think junkies and alcoholics are slovenly, unmotivated people. They're not they are incredibly organised. They can nip out for a quick shot of whisky and you wouldn't know they have gone. It's as if you are micro-managed by it,"" Pegg said.

""But eventually the signs are too obvious. You have taken the dog for one too many walks,"" he added.

Eminem celebrates 10 years of sobriety,Eminem celebrates 10 years of sobriety,,2018-04-23T11:25:17+05:30,"Los Angeles, Apr 23 (PTI) Rap king Eminem is celebrating 10 years of abstinence from alcohol and drugs.

The 45-year-old recording artiste, who has struggled with booze and substance abuse over the years, took to Instagram where he proudly announced a decade of staying clean.

""Celebrated my 10 years yesterday,"" Eminem wrote on April 21.

The ""Not Afraid"" hitmaker shared the pictured of a coin, which is given to Alcoholics Anonymous members when achieve a milestone in their journey, featured a Roman numeral X (meaning 10) engraved on it, along with words ""service"", ""unity"" and ""recovery"".

Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, nearly died from an accidental overdose in 2007.

Alcohol withdrawal refers to symptoms that may occur when a person who has been drinking too much alcohol every day suddenly stops drinking alcohol.

Alternative Names

Detoxification - alcohol; Detox - alcohol

Causes

Alcohol withdrawal occurs most often in adults, but it may occur in teenagers or children.

The more you drink every day, the more likely you are to develop alcohol withdrawal symptoms when you stop drinking.

You may have more severe withdrawal symptoms if you have certain other medical problems.

Symptoms

Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually occur within 8 hours after the last drink, but can occur days later. Symptoms usually peak by 24 - 72 hours, but may persist for weeks.

Common symptoms include:

Anxiety or nervousness

or nervousness Depression

Fatigue

Irritability

Jumpiness or shakiness

Mood swings

Nightmares

Not thinking clearly

Other symptoms may include:

Clammy skin

Enlarged (dilated) pupils

Headache

Insomnia (sleeping difficulty)

Loss of appetite

Nausea and vomiting

Pallor

Rapid heart rate

Sweating

Tremor of the hands or other body parts

A severe form of alcohol withdrawal called delirium tremens can cause:

Agitation

Fever

Seeing or feeling things that arent there (hallucinations)

Seizures

Severe confusion

Exams and Tests

Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may reveal:

Abnormal eye movements

Abnormal heart rhythms

Dehydration (not enough fluids in the body)

Fever

Rapid breathing

Rapid heart rate

Shaky hands

Blood and urine tests, including a toxicology screen , may be done.

Treatment

The goal of treatment includes:

Reducing withdrawal symptoms

Preventing complications of alcohol use

Therapy to get you to stop drinking (abstinence)

INPATIENT TREATMENT

People with moderate-to-severe symptoms of alcohol withdrawal may need inpatient treatment at a hospital or other facility that treats alcohol withdrawal. You will be watched closely for hallucinations and other signs of delirium tremens .

Treatment may include:

Monitoring of blood pressure, body temperature, heart rate, and blood levels of different chemicals in the body

Fluids or medications through a vein (by IV)

Sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete

OUTPATIENT TREATMENT

If you have mild-to-moderate alcohol withdrawal symptoms, you can often be treated in an outpatient setting. You will need someone to commit to staying with you during this process and who can keep an eye on you. Daily visits to your health care provider are often needed until you are stable.

Treatment usually includes:

Sedative drugs to help ease withdrawal symptoms

Blood tests

Patient and family counseling to discuss the long-term issue of alcoholism

Testing and treatment for other medical problems linked to alcohol use

It is important that the patient goes to a living situation that helps support them in staying sober. Some areas have housing options that provide a supportive environment for those trying to stay sober.

Permanent and life-long abstinence from alcohol is the best treatment for those who have gone through withdrawal.

Support Groups

The following organizations are good resources for information on alcoholism:

Alcoholics Anonymous - www.alcoholics-anonymous.org

- www.alcoholics-anonymous.org Al-Anon/Alateen - www.al-anon.org

- http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration - www.samhsa.gov

Outlook (Prognosis)

How well a person does depends on the amount of organ damage and whether the person can stop drinking completely. Alcohol withdrawal may range from a mild and uncomfortable disorder to a serious, life-threatening condition.

Symptoms such as sleep changes, rapid changes in mood, and fatigue may last for months. People who continue to drink a lot may develop health problems such as liver, heart, and neurological disease.

Most people who go through alcohol withdrawal make a full recovery. However, death is possible, especially if delirium tremens occurs.

When to Contact a Medical Professional

Alcohol withdrawal is a serious condition that may rapidly become life threatening.

Call your health care provider or go the emergency room if you think you might be in alcohol withdrawal, especially if you were using alcohol often and recently stopped. Call for an appointment with your health care provider if symptoms persist after treatment.

Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if seizures, fever, severe confusion, hallucinations, or irregular heartbeats occur.

Prevention

Reduce or avoid alcohol. If you have alcoholism, you should stop drinking completely.

Drink dependence up in urban Indian women,The 33-year-old married woman from Chandigarh had never imagined that her excessive clubbing and partying would one day push her to the brink of suicide. But it did.,,2012-11-30T17:24:51+05:30,"The 33-year-old married woman from Chandigarh had never imagined that her excessive clubbing and partying would one day push her to the brink of suicide. But it did.

She was not the only one. In an increasing trend of urban women taking to alcohol to cope with everyday stresses as societal norms ease, a 28-year-old woman working as a senior executive in a property broking firm in Mumbai also developed suicidal tendencies.

What started for both the Bacchus lovers as socialising, ended up in drink dependence and pushed them into the infamous club of over 14 million alcohol consumers in the country who require help. Though there are no exact figures of how many of these are women, the trend is clear.

The Mumbai woman ran up a debt of Rs25 lakh (Rs2.5 million) and attempted suicide due to her ""unmanageable"" life and depression. The Chandigarh woman showed addiction- related suicidal tendencies after a turbulent married life, extra-marital affairs and a failed patch-up bid with her husband.

The two are now trying to get a grip over their lives and move away from drink dependence, with some help from de-addiction experts who say they needed to be cared like brain patients who don't know how to prevent themselves from returning to the old habit despite being aware of its perils.

But their difficult phase is over, says NGO Tulasi Home's consultant doctor Goruv Gupta. ""Realising or accepting that one needs help is the toughest part of getting over the drink dependence problem.""

Sociologist Sachin Kumar, associated with Alcoholics Anonymous, told IANS: ""Intoxication by women in some communities has existed for time immemorial. Traditionally, it has been a collective activity but in modern times the incidence of individual drinking has shown a rise.""

The social checks or restraint that used to prescribe the limit of alcohol consumption in older times have faded over the years, leading to worst forms of drink dependence among both men and women, he said.

According to a 2009 article in journal The Lancet, Indians, officially, are still among the world's lowest consumers of alcohol - government statistics show only 21 percent of adult men and around two percent of women drink. But up to a fifth of this group - about 14 million people - are dependent drinkers requiring ""help"".

""Addiction is a chronic, relapsing disease, characterised by compulsive alcohol seeking and use, and by neurochemical and molecular changes in the brain,"" said Gupta.

For women drinkers, the news is worse than for men.

Gupta warned that alcohol addiction was more harmful for a woman's body as compared to a man; in a woman, alchohol tends to induce permanent hormonal changes in the body, making rehabilitation more difficult.

The problem of shortage of de-addiction centres was also more acute for women.

Ruchika Kumari, who works at several private de-addiction centres in Delhi, agreed: ""Alcohol addiction is considered to carry a bigger social stigma for women as compared to men and the challenge of weaning away is tougher for them due to shortage of fully-equipped centres.""

""Families need to leave the women dependent drinkers at deaddiction centre's for medical aid and counselling and this needs a lot of faith in the facility,"" she said.

""Most people prefer private facilities as they score over the government sector in terms of security, hygiene and quality of treatment.""

She revealed that there was no particular age bracket for women drinkers. ""At our centre in south Delhi, we have women from 48 years to 28 years seeking counselling.""

The service that private centres offer to get rid of dependence comes at a price.

A six-week rehabilitation procedure in some of the high-end centres in Delhi costs around Rs1 lakh (Rs100,000). In Delhi alone there are over three dozen NGO-run, private and government facilities that offer help to people with drink dependence.

Gupta warned against ill-trained quacks offering help to dependent drinkers and ending up traumatising the patient.

""I have seen a case where a patient was sent by his family to a private facility in Haryana and there he was tortured, stripped and humiliated in the name of de-addiction,"" he said.","['centres', 'help', 'women', 'drinkers', 'woman', 'dependence', 'drink', 'private', 'indian', 'deaddiction', 'alcohol', 'urban']","""Realising or accepting that one needs help is the toughest part of getting over the drink dependence problem.""

IAF faces HC ire for confining corporal to psychiatric ward for alcohol dependency,,,2018-07-12T19:13:00+05:30,"New Delhi, Jul 12 (PTI) The Indian Air Force (IAF) faced the ire of the Delhi High Court today for confining one of its non-commissioned officers, a corporal, to a psychiatric ward for over two months, because he was an alcoholic and suffered from mental disorders.

A bench of justices S Muralidhar and Vinod Goel questioned the rationale behind the IAF's decision, asking how it determined on a daily basis that the corporal still ""craved for alcohol"".

The court also said the newly-enacted Mental Health Act made it clear that a person could not be forced to undergo treatment without his consent, adding that the IAF ""cannot ignore the laws of the country"".

Terming the conduct of the IAF ""irresponsible"", the bench wondered how many of such cases there might be, which were yet to be highlighted.

""How were you determining on a daily basis that his craving for alcohol had not gone down? What tests were conducted by you? This is completely irresponsible. We wonder how many such cases are there.

""This is a clear case where a man is saying he has been detained without consent. Under the new Mental Health Act, you cannot force him to undergo treatment without his consent. Then how are you pumping him full of drugs? We do not know who should be proceeded against,"" the bench said.

It added that the IAF needed to be reminded not to interfere with a person's liberty as ""short of chaining him up, everything else was done here"" and directed that the corporal be produced in court tomorrow.

According to the IAF, represented by the Centre's standing counsel, Ripudaman Singh Bhardwaj, the action against the corporal was taken on a complaint from his wife that he turned violent after consuming alcohol.

Bhardwaj said the corporal, Kriyad Yogesh Bhankhariya, had alcohol dependency issues for which he was initially treated in the psychiatric ward of the Army Base Hospital here and thereafter, in June, he was shifted to the medical centre at the Tughlakabad Air Force Station.

The court said if the non-commissioned officer (NCO) was an alcoholic, then the IAF ought to have sought the help of the ""Alcoholics Anonymous"" on how to deal with the matter as any psychiatric would confirm that confinement of a person was advisable only in extreme cases.

""It is worrying, the manner in which you have approached the situation,"" the bench told the IAF.

The court was hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by the 30-year-old corporal's father, claiming that his son was being illegally confined at the Army Base Hospital.

Alcohol use involves drinking beer, wine, or hard liquor.

Alternative Names

Beer consumption; Wine consumption; Hard liquor consumption; Safe drinking

Information

Alcohol is one of the most widely used drug substances in the world.

TEEN DRINKING

Alcohol use is not only an adult problem. Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month, despite the fact that the legal drinking age is 21 years old in the U.S.

About 1 in 5 teens are considered ""problem drinkers."" This means that they:

Get drunk

Have accidents related to alcohol use

Get into trouble with the law, family members, friends, school, or dates because of alcohol

THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL

Alcoholic drinks have different amounts of alcohol in them:

Beeris about 5% alcohol, although some beers can have more.

Wine is usually 12 to 15% alcohol.

Hard liquor is about 45% alcohol.

Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly.

The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly.

Certain types of alcoholic drinks get into your bloodstream faster. A carbonated (fizzy) alcoholic drink, such as champagne, will be absorbed faster than a non-carbonated drink.

Alcohol slows your breathing rate, heart rate, and how well your brain functions. These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your ""blood alcohol level."" If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises.

Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The blood alcohol legal limit usually falls between 0.08 and 0.10 in most states. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms.

0.05 -- reduced inhibitions

0.10 -- slurred speech

0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment

0.30 -- confusion

0.40 -- stupor

0.50 -- coma

0.60 -- respiratory paralysis and death

You can have symptoms of ""being drunk"" at blood alcohol levels below the legal definition of being drunk. Also, people who drink alcohol frequently may not have symptoms until a higher blood alcohol level is reached.

HEALTH RISKS OF ALCOHOL

Alcohol increases the risk of:

Alcoholism or alcohol dependence

Falls, drownings, and other accidents

Head, neck, stomach, and breast cancers

Motor vehicle accidents

Risky sex behaviors, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)

Suicide and homicide

Drinking during pregnancy can harm the developing baby. Severe birth defects or fetal alcohol syndrome are possible.

RESPONSIBLE DRINKING

If you drink alcohol, it is best to do so in moderation. Moderation means the drinking is not getting you intoxicated (or drunk) and you are drinking no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman and no more than 2 if you are a man. A drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1 ounces of liquor.

Here are some ways to drink responsibly, provided you do not have a drinking problem, are of legal age to drink alcohol, and are not pregnant:

Never drink alcohol and drive a car.

If you are going to drink, have a designated driver, or plan an alternative way home, such as a taxi or bus.

Do not drink on an empty stomach. Snack before and while drinking alcohol.

If you are taking medication, including over-the-counter drugs, check with your doctor before drinking alcohol. Alcohol can make the effects of many medicines stronger. It can also interact with other medicines, making them ineffective or dangerous or make you sick.

Do not drink if you have a history of alcohol abuse or alcoholism.

If alcoholism runs in your family, you may be at increased risk of developing alcoholism yourself, so you may want to avoid drinking alcohol altogether.

CALL YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IF:

You are concerned about your personal alcohol use or that of a family member

You are interested in more information regarding alcohol use, alcohol abuse , or support groups

, or support groups You are unable to reduce or stop your alcohol consumption, in spite of attempts to stop drinking

Other resources include:

Local Alcoholics Anonymous or Al-anon/Alateen groups

Local hospitals

Public or private mental health agencies

School or work counselors

Student or employee health centers

Fetal alcohol syndrome is growth, mental, and physical problems that may occur in a baby when a mother drinks alcohol during pregnancy.

Alternative Names

Alcohol in pregnancy; Alcohol-related birth defects; Fetal alcohol effects; FAS

Causes, incidence, and risk factors

Using or abusing alcohol during pregnancy can cause the same risks as using alcohol in general. However, it poses extra risks to the unborn baby. When a pregnant woman drinks alcohol, it easily passes across the placenta to the fetus. Because of this, drinking alcohol can harm the babys development.

A pregnant woman who drinks any amount of alcohol is at risk for having a child with fetal alcohol syndrome. No ""safe"" level of alcohol use during pregnancy has been established. Larger amounts of alcohol appear to increase the problems. Binge drinking is more harmful than drinking small amounts of alcohol.

Timing of alcohol use during pregnancy is also important. Alcohol use appears to be the most harmful during the first 3 months of pregnancy; however, drinking alcohol any time during pregnancy can be harmful.

Symptoms

A baby with fetal alcohol syndrome may have the following symptoms:

Poor growth while the baby is in the womb and after birth

Decreased muscle tone and poor coordination

Delayed development and problems in three or more major areas: thinking, speech, movement, or social skills

Heart defects such as ventricular septal defect (VSD) or atrial septal defect (ASD)

or Problems with the face, including: Narrow, small eyes with large epicanthal folds Small head Small upper jaw Smooth groove in upper lip Smooth and thin upper lip



Signs and tests

A physical exam of the baby may show a heart murmur or other heart problems. As the baby grows, there may be signs of delayed mental development. There also may be problems with the face and bones.

Tests include:

Blood alcohol level in pregnant women who show signs of being drunk (intoxicated)

Brain imaging studies (CT or MRI) after the child is born

Pregnancy ultrasound

Treatment

Women who are pregnant or who are trying to get pregnant should avoid drinking any amount of alcohol. Pregnant women with alcoholism should join an alcohol abuse rehabilitation program and be checked closely by a health care provider throughout pregnancy.

Support Groups

The following organizations may offer assistance:

National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependency -- www.ncadd.org

National Drug and Alcohol Treatment Referral Routing Service -- 1-800-662-4357

The following organizations are good resources for information on alcoholism:

Alcoholics Anonymous - www.alcoholics-anonymous.org

Al-Anon/Alateen - www.al-anon.org

National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism - www.niaaa.nih.gov/

Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration - www.samhsa.gov

Expectations (prognosis)

The outcome for infants with fetal alcohol syndrome varies. Almost none of these babies have normal brain development.

Infants and children with fetal alcohol syndrome have many different problems, which can be difficult to manage. Children do best if they are diagnosed early and referred to a team of health care providers who can work on educational and behavioral strategies that fit the childs needs.

Complications

Drinking alcohol during pregnancy may result in:

Miscarriage or stillbirth

or Premature delivery

Complications seen in the infant may include:

Abnormal heart structure

Behavior problems

Infant death

Intellectual disability

Problems in the structure of the head, eyes, nose, or mouth

Poor growth before birth

Slow growth and poor coordination after birth

Calling your health care provider

Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you are drinking alcohol regularly or heavily, and are finding it difficult to cut back or stop. Also, call if you are drinking alcohol in any amount while you are pregnant or trying to get pregnant.

Prevention

Avoiding alcohol during pregnancy prevents fetal alcohol syndrome. Counseling can help women who have already had a child with fetal alcohol syndrome.

Sexually active women who drink heavily should use birth control and control their drinking behaviors, or stop using alcohol before trying to get pregnant.

Pathological gambling is being unable to resist impulses to gamble, which can lead to severe personal or social consequences.

Alternative Names

Gambling - compulsive; Compulsive gambling; Addictive gambling

Causes

Pathological gambling usually begins in early adolescence in men, and between ages 20 and 40 in women.

Pathological gambling often involves repetitive behaviors. People with this problem have a hard time resisting or controlling the impulse to gamble. Although it shares features of obsessive compulsive disorder, pathological gambling is likely a different condition.

In people who develop pathological gambling, occasional gambling leads to a gambling habit. Stressful situations can worsen gambling problems.

Symptoms

People with pathological gambling often feel ashamed and try to avoid letting other people know about their problem. The American Psychiatric Association defines pathological gambling as having five or more of the following symptoms:

Committing crimes to get money to gamble

Feeling restless or irritable when trying to cut back or quit gambling

Gambling to escape problems or feelings of sadness or anxiety

Gambling larger amounts of money to try to make back past losses

Losing a job, relationship, education, or career opportunity due to gambling

Lying about the amount of time or money spent gambling

Making many unsuccessful attempts to cut back or quit gambling

Needing to borrow money due to gambling losses

Needing to gamble larger amounts of money in order to feel excitement

Spending a lot of time thinking about gambling, such as remembering past experiences or ways to get more money with which to gamble

Exams and Tests

A psychiatric evaluation and history can be used to diagnose pathological gambling. Screening tools such as the Gamblers Anonymous 20 Questions can help with the diagnosis.

Treatment

Treatment for people with pathological gambling begins with recognizing the problem. Pathological gamblers often deny they have a problem or need treatment.

Most people with pathological gambling only get treated when other people pressure them.

Treatment options include:

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)

Self-help support groups , such as Gamblers Anonymous. Gamblers Anonymous is a 12-step program similar to Alcoholics Anonymous. Practices used to treat other types of addiction, such as substance abuse and alcohol dependence , can also be helpful in treating pathological gambling.

A few studies have been done on medications for treating pathological gambling. Early results suggest that antidepressants and opioid antagonists (naltrexone) may help treat the symptoms of pathological gambling. However, it is not yet clear which people will respond to medications.

Outlook (Prognosis)

Like alcohol or drug addiction, pathological gambling is a long-term disorder that tends to get worse without treatment. Even with treatment, its common to start gambling again (relapse). However, people with pathological gambling can do very well with the right treatment.

Possible Complications

Complications may include:

Alcohol and drug abuse problems

Anxiety

Depression

Financial, social, and legal problems (including bankruptcy, divorce, job loss, time in prison)

Heart attacks (from the stress and excitement of gambling)

Suicide attempts

Getting the right treatment can help prevent many of these problems.

When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call your health care provider or mental health professional if you believe you have symptoms of pathological gambling.

Prevention

Exposure to gambling may increase the risk of developing pathological gambling. Limiting exposure may be helpful for people who are at risk.

Public exposure to gambling, however, continues to increase in the form of lotteries, electronic and Internet gambling, and casinos. Intervention at the earliest signs of pathological gambling may prevent the disorder from getting worse.

Alcoholic neuropathy is damage to the nerves that results from excessive drinking of alcohol.

Alternative Names

Neuropathy - alcoholic; Alcoholic polyneuropathy

Causes

The exact cause of alcoholic neuropathy is unknown. Itlikely includes both a direct poisoning of the nerve by the alcohol and the effect of poor nutrition associated with alcoholism. Up to half of long-term heavy alcohol users develop this condition.

In severe cases, nerves that regulate internal body functions (autonomic nerves) may be involved.

Risksof alcoholic neuropathy include:

Long-term, heavy alcohol use

Alcoholism that is present for 10 years or more

Symptoms

Numbness in the arms and legs

in the arms and legs Abnormal sensations , such as""pins and needles""

, such as""pins and needles"" Painful sensations in the arms and legs

Muscle weakness

Muscle cramps or muscle aches

or Heat intolerance , especially after exercise

, especially after exercise Impotence (in men)

(in men) Problems urinating , incontinence (leaking urine), feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, difficulty beginning to urinate

, (leaking urine), feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, Constipation

Diarrhea

Nausea, vomiting

Additional symptoms that may occur with this disease:

Swallowing difficulty

Speech impairment

Loss of muscle function or feeling

Muscle contractions or spasm

or spasm Muscle atrophy

Movement disorders

Changes in muscle strength or sensation usually occur on both sides of the body and are more common in the legs than in the arms. Symptoms usually develop gradually and become worse over time.

Exams and Tests

Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. An eye exam may show eye problems.

Alcoholism often makes your body unable to use or store certain vitamins and minerals. Blood tests will beordered to check for a deficiency (lack of):

Thiamine (vitamin B1)

Pyridoxine (vitamin B6)

Pantothenic acid and biotin

Vitamin B12

Folic acid

Niacin (vitamin B3)

Vitamin A

Additional tests may beordered to rule out other possible causes of neuropathy. Tests may include:

Electrolyte levels

Electromyography ( EMG )

Liver and kidney function tests

Thyroid function tests

Levels of vitamins and minerals in the body

Nerve conduction tests

Nerve biopsy

Upper GI and small bowel series

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD )

) Voiding cystourethrogram

Treatment

Once the alcohol problem has been addressed, treatment goals include:

Controlling symptoms

Maximizing ability to function independently

Preventing injury

It is important to supplement the diet with vitamins, including thiamine and folic acid.

Physical therapy and orthopedic appliances (such as splints) may be needed tomake suremuscle function and limb position are maintained.

Medicines may be neededto treat pain or uncomfortable sensations.Because persons with alcoholic neuropathy have alcohol dependence problems, theyare advised to take the least amount of medicine needed to reduce symptoms to help prevent drug dependence and other side effects of chronic use.

Positioning or the use of a bed frame that keeps the covers off the legs may reduce pain for some people.

Light-headedness or dizziness when standing up (orthostatic hypotension) may require several different treatments before finding one that successfully reduces symptoms. Treatments that may help include:

Wearing compression stockings

Eating extra salt

Sleeping with the head elevated

Using medicines

Bladderproblems may be treated with:

Manual expression of urine

Intermittent catheterization ( male or female )

Medicines

Impotence, diarrhea, constipation, or other symptoms are treated when necessary. These symptoms often respond poorly to treatment in people with alcoholic neuropathy.

It is important to protect body parts with reduced sensation from injury. This may include:

Checking the temperature of bath water to prevent burns

Changing footwear

Frequently inspecting the feet and shoes to reduce injury caused by pressure or objects in the shoes

Guarding the extremities to prevent injury from pressure

Alcohol must be stopped to prevent the damage from getting worse. Treatment for alcoholism may include counseling or social support such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), or taking medicines.

Outlook (Prognosis)

Damage to nerves from alcoholic neuropathy is usually permanent.It is likely to get worse ifthe personcontinues to use alcohol orif nutritional problems are notcorrected. Alcoholic neuropathyis usually not life-threatening, but itcan severely affect quality of life.

Possible Complications

Disability

Long-term (chronic) discomfort or pain

Injury to extremities

Falling, especially at night

Urinary incontinence or retention

When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of alcoholic neuropathy.

Prevention

The only way to prevent alcoholic neuropathy is not to drink alcohol.

Ribeiro's appointment should boost the sagging morale of the police.,,2014-01-31T13:12:09+05:30,"The cover story on alcoholism (""Growing Malaise"", April 30) is both interesting and alarming. The only disincentive to excessive drinking and smoking would be an enormous price hike on these commodities. But the Government's collections from taxes on alcohol are substantial and a downward trend in sales would not be favoured. The growing malaise of alcoholism can only be controlled by the Government.The reference in your cover story on alcoholism to 'Mathew', a copywriter in a leading advertising agency in New Delhi, has caused me serious embarrassment as I have been receiving calls from my friends and business associates. I have recently started out on my own after leaving Lintas, my last employers, with goodwill.In the absence of the full name of the person you are referring to, your report is going to serve as a disincentive to my present and future clients and thereby affect my new business venture. I am sure you will agree that alcoholics do not embark on business ventures and employ staff and premises, as I have done. As far as I am concerned, I have never visited Alcoholics Anonymous anywhere any time.As a grateful and recovering member of the wonderful fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous, I wish to express my appreciation for your lead story on alcoholism. AA has perhaps one of the most successful programmes for treating addicts. I would also like to add that we at AA have no desire to dry up the world. Our purpose is to stay sober and help alcoholics achieve sobriety.The only hope for Punjab (""Upsurge of Violence"", April 15) lies in weaning the mass of Sikhs away from the militants. Those who believe that the militants can be suppressed by physical force are living in a world of illusion. Heinous as their crimes are the reactions of the press, government and political parties only help the militants cause. The people wonder why these same groups did not condemn as vociferously the murder of innocent Sikhs in June and October 1984. Why were those guilty of murder then let off, while those picked up as extremists are still kept in custody. Tackling militancy in Punjab is a delicate task requiring an understanding of the Sikh psyche.and othersThe unending crisis in the state is a pointer to the inefficiency and apathy of the Punjab Government, both the present and the erstwhile ones, in dealing with the fissiparous forces who are out to sunder the country. Determination has been the hallmark of the terrorists, and by their well-planned attacks on innocent people, they have time and again proved that they have the support of alien forces.The communal vein in the terrorist violence is disturbing. The divide between the two major communities in the state seems to be total. The police is totally demoralised and communal. Ribeiro's appointment should boost the sagging morale of the police.Punjab has become another pawn on the political chess-board. Moves are made without consulting the people and the Government's decision is forcing people to make moves that they don't want to. The state needs to tread carefully.The Government's policy of interfering and not allowing the police or those responsible for maintaining law and order to concentrate on one task has meant the weakening of defences. The state is bowing down to the terrorists' sinister designs by not ensuring communal harmony. It's an 'Upsurge of Super-Violence'.Sometimes the Punjab problem seems quite hopeless. I can't understand why people feel Hindus and Sikhs are not brothers. Sikhism is as much a part of the Hindu religion as Shaivism and Vaishnavism.Peace can only be brought back to Punjab by force. If we want peace we must prepare ourselves for war against the terrorists acting at the behest of foreign powers. Every party should unite and work jointly, fired by a spirit of national solidarity. National integration is the weapon for our survival.If the people unite to resist the growing communalism, the terrorists will be demoralised and return to the mainstream. The Akali Government should not be so weak-kneed.In your Special Report (""Operation Disarm"" April 15), you did not emphasise the fact that the verification procedure for the issue of gun licences is hardly likely to improve the efficiency of the understaffed Uttar Pradesh police. If the Government had the foresight to consider an armed people as a deterrent to crime, such senseless projects would never see the light of day.At a time when law and order is practically non-existent and the police ineffective, people must be allowed to make arrangements for their own protection. Gun licences must be abolished. History is with us in this regard. It was the British who first introduced the arms licence in India, to disarm the Indian people, after suppressing the 1857 mutiny.Your article faithfully echoes the sarkari tune regarding reducing the number of licensed weapons with citizens. Licensed weapons are rarely used in committing crimes - a fact which even the Lucknow SSP could have corroborated if he knew his facts. What needs to be curbed is the menace of illegal firearms which outnumber the former 10:1.""The Dues of Death"" (April 15) on the Dom Raja is poignant and moving. Choudhury's pathetic statement, ""If I open a shop who will come""? is a telling comment on our society. It is a pity that the scourge of untouchability is yet to free our hearts and minds.It is regrettable that a magazine of your stature has seen it to publish such bizarre and nightmarish photographs. They are nauseous, to say the least. I have hidden the issue from my children lest they get scared.Your article (""Poaching Problems"" April 15) has left out the fact that the IAS rules the roost in all departments. Rules are tailor-made to suit them. For instance. a deputation to the public sector means permanent absorption to all except IAS officers, who are free to jump from post to post. They refuse to work in the districts, except as very junior officers and the IAS is the only service where everybody rises to the level of additional secretary irrespective of competence.Tamil Nadu's chief minister (""The Fading Star"" April 15) has become a black hole! MGR is a spent force. He should gracefully retire when he is still widely admired and respected. After all, how long can Tamil Nadu tolerate this Rip Van Winkle?Your story (""Vulnerable Targets"" April 15) raises one question. When the banks do not take adequate security measures, why do the insurance companies compensate them? Is it because the compensation is paid out of public money and not out of their pockets? Also, insurance companies must insist on some security norms that all banks have to follow.Your article quotes Police Commissioner Soman as saying that ""nobody knows the procedure to be followed when there is a robbery"". But he conveniently forgot the police who issue gun licences indiscriminately, endangering innocent citizens.Your report on Sobh raj (""The Escape Scandal"" April 15) raises a very disturbing thought. If Ved Prakash Garg had not been sacked for leaking his letter to the press, and his suggestions accepted and implemented, Tihar jail would not be in the soup it is today. It also brings to mind President Zail Singh's statement about the prison: ""It is shocking, shameful and unbelievable.""(Retd)The Doordarshan article (""The Money Machine"" April 15) made shocking revelations about high-level corruption. Will 'Corruption in TV' figure as the next episode inOn the day I was reading your article, Doordarshan screened the telefilm Hum Nahin Sudhrmge, which centred on corruption. Perhaps by showing this film, which was suddenly brought in place of another film, Doordarshan wanted the viewers to know that things just won't improve.Your exposure of Air-India's manner of leasing freighter aircraft (""Double Dealing"", March 31) has put the airline's officials on the mat. Instead of setting their house in order, the Maharajah's men have inserted a quarter page advertisement in leading newspapers in defence. There is nothing new in their denials, which could have been made through a press release as is the practice.Your article (""Bad Taste"" March 31) ridicules our efforts in exporting fresh fruits and vegetables. On the contrary, Air-India should be congratulated for not cutting its freight rates since now there will be more going round for the common man at reasonable prices.D.B.N.

The skywriter,,,2010-01-15T15:49:50+05:30,"More than a decade ago, when I first visited the Nehru Planetarium, I never knew what surprises awaited me. I was a student of literature with no interest in astrophysics whatsoever. I was accompanying a friend who was a member of AAAD. I had heard lots of interesting stories about this club (which sounded more like Alcoholics Anonymous), but actually stood for Amateur Astronomers Association of Delhi.



My first impression of the planetarium was that it was a dark and dim place with lots of space-related objects that made little sense to me at the time. But the moment I entered the Night Sky Theatre, I was hooked. It has a simulated night sky where amateur astronomers learn to navigate their way across the stars, constellations and other heavenly bodies. I was amazed to know that not only do the constellations have names, but all 88 of them have names for each of the star that forms them as well.



Another thing that truly interested me as a literature student was that most of the northern constellations were named after Greek gods like Aries, legendary heroes such as Hercules, mythical creatures like Cetus, Centaurus and Hydra, and even the mythological river of Eridanus!



Who would have thought that I would see an amalgamation of literature and ancient mythology in the so-called 'den of science'.



It as then that I realised that astronomy is different things to different people. Maybe that is the reason why AAAD housed members from six to 60 years old. It nurtured people's imaginations and inspired them to look at the heavens and beyond.



For school students, who usually come during the vacations, it is a place to make that special science project that will give them an edge over others. For college students, it is a stepping stone to know more about astrophysics and astronomy-a field that is unfortunately not covered in the undergraduate level in any Indian university.



Even when I accompanied our group for overnight observations in the hinterland, I noticed that everyone saw the stars from their individual perspective. A student of chemistry sees nuclear reactions. A physicist may be more interested in the electromagnetic effect that celestial objects will have. A farmer sees the night sky as a calendar that helps him decide when to sow and reap his harvest. A navigator sees the night sky as a guide pointing to new places. A poet sees the beauty of the night sky as an inspiration. To the common man, with an interest in myths, the night sky reflects the different stories heard during childhood.



This was one of the many reasons why I chose to be faithful to astronomy-it is a truly democratic science. In short, astronomy has a very big heart, perhaps as big as the universe it tries to explore.

The baby out with the bathwater,The BMC in its most shameless display of abuse of power has now decided to throw out more than 200 such NGOs that operate from its civic schools.,,2013-10-14T09:54:42+05:30,"The BMC talks of opening more English medium classrooms but, over the years, the standard of education has fallen to such an extent that parents are simply not sending their children to civic schools.

Remember Shweta Katti? The 18-year-old who was living in Kamathipura, Mumbai's red light district, is now pursuing a course in Psychology at Bard University in the US. Katti lived most of her life in Kamathipura and braved sexual assaults and other discrimination to go to the US simply because NGOs like Indian Association for Promotion and Adoption of child welfare (IAPA), Kranti and many other organisations were involved in giving her the guidance like providing education, counseling and guidance and financial help.



Katti could however be the last girl at least from Mumbai to benefit simply because the BMC in its most shameless display of abuse of power has now decided to throw out more than 200 such NGOs that operate from its civic schools. So the Helen Keller Institute for Deaf and Deaf blind, IAPA and Alcoholics Anonymous all would have to vacate civic schools in the next few months. All these NGOs do not interfere in the functioning of the civic schools in Mumbai, and in fact occupy just a few classrooms that are anyway unused simply because most were anyway lying vacant. These trusts and NGO's have been working since almost the 1980's however now with space being a premium in Mumbai, the BMC however now has woken up and has decided that these NGO's are to be evicted. Officially the Civic body's reasoning is this- The NGO';s pay less rent, and the NGO' s are not engaged in the business of education. The BMC wants the class rooms because then they could set up more English medium class rooms, and in others they would hold libraries and laboratories for civic schools.



The BMC's claim is is anything but hilarious: the civic body talks of opening more English medium classrooms but, over the years, the standard of education has fallen to such an extent that parents are simply not sending their children to civic schools. In fact even parents from the lower social strata prefer to send their kids to private schools, even though the fees are high and it is a strain on their monthly budget. So while the civic body talks of upgrading the English medium schools, the fact remains that the civic body's dismal education standard has fallen to such an extent that there are many parents who are just not putting their children in civic run Marathi medium schools, forcing many of them to shut down.



Make no mistake after having these NGOs vacate these schools, the BMC is not going to open more English medium schools or labs or libraries but will be letting it out to educational institutes who charge a bomb for education children and coaching classes.



We are supposed to trust the same BMC that year after year allots the same road contractors money to build roads that don't last even till the first monsoon showers. The BMC that ignores structural changes done in a building, even though it knows that it would lead to the building collapsing and killing people residing in it.



It is clear that the NGOs and other social organisations are being evicted simply because a few in the BMC have realised that these properties could be exploited to make another fast buck. So far the many Shweta Kattis out there, tough luck, if you manage to stay in the same rut and get exploited or worse, turn into sex workers, you can blame your fate or the BMC.

Actor Ranveer Singh just got released from a hospital after suffering from dengue. The disease that is spread through mosquitoes has reached such alarming levels that more than a thousand have been affected. The BMC however claims only 615 people in the city have been affected and only six have died - basing this on figures of only those who were admitted in civic hospitals.

A sweet scam in Mumbai's mills



Social activists Anna Hazare and Medha Patkar have alleged a Rs 10,000 crore scam in the sale of sugar mills in Mumbai. Hazare and Patkar have alleged that the sugar mills, all of which were sick, were sold off for just Rs 12 crores to Rs 108 crores. While the mills were sick, there does appear to be a hint of a scam as the sugar cooperatives have hundreds of acres of land which meant that they should have been sold for a higher price.



Incidentally most of these sugar mills have been bought by politicians or controlled by them. From NCP leader and Deputy CM Ajit Pawar, PWD Minister Chagggan Bhujbal to Rural Development Minister Jayant Patil, all got the mills at a cheap rate than their actual valuation allege Hazare and co.



Interestingly the Congress, which usually gloats on allegations against the NCP, is silent because even some of its own leaders have allegedly benefited. The BJP too is silent because its former National Chief Nitin Gadkari is also an alleged beneficiary.

A day in the life of a Mumbai constable



Last week a video went viral of a model-cum-actress who was caught on camera abusing the Mumbai police and the police commissioner, all because the cops had gone to her residence asking her to lower her volume in the night as her neighbours had complained.



What was interesting in the video was the old constable who stood stone-faced without even as much as saying shut up to the belligerent girl. Many felt sorry for the constable, who kept all his anger on check because there was a woman in front of him. Since they could not detain the girl without a lady constable, the model kept on abusing and humiliating the constable who stood like the Buddha.



While the Mumbai police are a much maligned lot, the above incident illustrates the challenges that the lower rung of the police - derogatorily called 'pandus' - have to face almost daily. Most of the life of a constable in Mumbai is spent either in the police station or on bandobast duty. He is seldom at home, all his Dusseheras, Diwalis and New years are spent ensuring that people do not drunken drive, kill people or molest women.



In fact since they are severely short staffed the constables many times end up working for more than 30 hours non stop. In spite of all of this if there is a untoward incident in their jurisdiction then these constables and their seniors like Inspectors and Senior Inspectors get abused by their superiors, not unlike the treatment meted out by the model.","['civic', 'education', 'english', 'schools', 'bathwater', 'simply', 'bmc', 'ngos', 'baby', 'mumbai', 'medium', 'mills']","So the Helen Keller Institute for Deaf and Deaf blind, IAPA and Alcoholics Anonymous all would have to vacate civic schools in the next few months.
Officially the Civic body's reasoning is this- The NGO';s pay less rent, and the NGO' s are not engaged in the business of education.
The BMC wants the class rooms because then they could set up more English medium class rooms, and in others they would hold libraries and laboratories for civic schools.

Goa Sports and Youth Affairs Minister Ramesh Tawadkar's comment about his government's intention to set up centres to offer medicinal treatment to the LGBT youth so as to normailse them attracted flak on the social media as well in the opposition ranks in Goa.

Tawadkar on Monday said that the Goa government was contemplating to start centres on the lines of Alcoholics Anonymous in order to make the LGBT youth normal. He was speaking to the media on the sidelines of a function held to launch the Goa State Youth Policy 2015 on Monday.

Twitter comments by the lesbian, gay bisexual and transgender community with the hashtag #ClinicBharo dedicated to Tawadkar's controversial statement took several digs at the Goa minister for his comments.

Says Manak Matiyani @Dafliwala: ""So are they allocating land close to the beach for the #GoaLGBTClinics? Must take a dip with other patients #ClinicBharo with #AnonymousLGBT

@delhiqueerpride tweeted: ""Hope the GoaGovernment clinics have separate gender dorms #AdmitLGBTAnonymous #ClinicBharo.""

""We will train them and (give them) medicines too,"" he added.

The Opposition Congress has also criticised Tawadkar for what it calls making an ""unscientific, illogical and brainless"" statement.

""Everyone has a right to live their life the way they want to. This statement is similar to the statement made by Baba Ramdev in 2013, when he had also offered to 'cure' homosexuality. Is the BJP government in Goa towing the Ramdev line?"" asked Congress spokesperson Durgadas Kamat.","['flak', 'opposition', 'lgbt', 'affairs', 'comment', 'ramesh', 'tawadkars', 'statement', 'minister', 'attracts', 'ramdev', 'youth', 'goa', 'tawadkar']","Goa Sports and Youth Affairs Minister Ramesh Tawadkar Goa Sports and Youth Affairs Minister Ramesh TawadkarGoa Sports and Youth Affairs Minister Ramesh Tawadkar's comment about his government's intention to set up centres to offer medicinal treatment to the LGBT youth so as to normailse them attracted flak on the social media as well in the opposition ranks in Goa.

Alarming number of youngsters in Indian cities take to drinking,Egged on by peers and condoned by indulgent parents an alarming number of youngsters in Indian cities are taking to the bottle. And chasing their own doom.,,2013-01-04T12:28:58+05:30,"Every fifth college student in Delhi drinks regularly. About three lakh teenagers can't kick the habit and one lakh need treatment. Every fifth college student in Delhi drinks regularly. About three lakh teenagers can't kick the habit and one lakh need treatment.

The parents were influential, the police turned silent and the incident got an official burial. But in Bangalore they still talk about it and with every telling the room turns cold with fear.

Five Bangalore boys decide to board a bus bound for Goa. One boy has stolen Rs 1.5 lakh from his parents to fund the trip. One of them gets cold feet and tips off the police. The errant four are found in Hubli, completely drunk. They are all 13 years old. They were going, they say, ""to drink and then die in Goa"".

Maybe that isn't chilling enough, so try this then. At 15, Sanjay Kumar was drinking Scotch. His father, a building contractor in Delhi wanted his son to ""live like a king"". This is a short story. At 19, the ""king"" was dead. Inebriated at a new year's party he drove his Zen into a pole.

The stories are getting gruesome, the evidence is mounting, the message is stark: teenage drinking is spiralling out of control. Drunk children in their shiny new cars with an alcohol-induced disdain for the law are worrying policemen.

Since January 1999, when the Chandigarh Police acquired a breath analyser, 226 people have been challaned for drunk driving. Nearly 40 per cent of them were teenagers. Similarly, the Maharashtra Police statistics show that in 1999 there were 244 accidents linked to teenagers who had imbibed a peg too many. Many of the accidents were fatal.

Teenagers, with no ID in hand, are streaming into liquor shops to buy their bottle of choice. Daljit Singh of Calcutta's Empire Stores says he gets an average of 60 teenage customers a day. ""They come during the daytime, and buy either canned beer or white drinks like vodka which are easy to conceal.""

Youngsters arriving at school with the stale smell of beer on their breath are not completely unknown. In Calcutta the principal of one of the city's posh schools suspended a boy for drinking on the campus.

In Delhi, Rajesh Kumar, then 15, drove to school with his friends, all clearly inebriated, and was thrown out. Today, with a history of deviant behaviour like locking his parents out of the house because they refused to give him a Gypsy, he is an alcoholic undergoing counselling. He is only 17.

Psychiatrists across the country are alarmed by this sudden spurt in teenage alcoholism. Delhi psychologist Dr Achal Bhagat puts it starkly, ""Alcoholism is becoming a lifestyle for teenagers"". In Chennai, Dr Gopalakrishnan at Chennai's Apollo Hospitals says, ""Children are misinterpreting a mug of beer for a fashion fad.""

He has six to 10 troubled teenage drinkers visiting him every month. Society in its ambivalence may pass it off as youthful indiscretion but it is far more serious than that. Alcohol routinely destroys brain cells, binge drinking can kill - in Bangalore, 17 youngsters drank all night late last year to find one of their friends dead in his own vomit the next morning - and the liver begins to malfunction.

Research by the WHO says that one out of 25 drinkers turns into an alcoholic. That's a scary statistic considering that alcoholics are 50 to 100 times more prone to commit suicide. As R. Kumar, a counsellor at the Bangalore chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous, confirms, ""We have more and more young people coming to us with drinking problems.""

Beyond the health impact is a larger social problem: young drinkers who move from use to abuse find their grades dropping, their interpersonal relationships turning sour and they often resort to deviant behaviour.

Says Harsh Vardhan, former health minister of Delhi and currently adviser to WHO's regional director for South-East Asia: ""When teenagers drink they damage their physical and mental growth. They are in fact chasing death.""

Almost half the 3,000 schoolchildren surveyed in Mumbai felt that alcohol was not harmful and that it enhanced self-confidence. Almost half the 3,000 schoolchildren surveyed in Mumbai felt that alcohol was not harmful and that it enhanced self-confidence.

The malaise is rooted in the societal acceptance of alcohol and society's indulgent view towards teenagers knocking down the odd peg. Unlike drugs that have an alarming connotation to them, a frothy glass of beer is hardly taboo.

If anything, there is a conspicuous absence of deterring messages. The images that waft into living rooms through cable television seem to promote the idea that a swig of beer equals youthful exuberance. Instead of public caution over alcohol's harmful effects, the signals are positive.

It's hard to convict Shah Rukh Khan for sauntering through a Bagpiper advertisement or Ajay Jadeja for dancing for Kingfisher, but there's no one there to interpret the message for children who go wide-eyed at what their heroes are doing. As psychiatrist Dr Debashish Bhattacharya explains, ""Teenagers have several mistaken notions about drinking: that it is masculine, it enhances the sex drive and that achievers do it.""

Hanging around at home with 17-year-old friends and posturing over a whisky bottle, or popping into a bar for an illegal pitcher of beer because it's hep, is common conduct among teenagers. For a generation of sensation seekers with an extremely low threshold of boredom, this is terrific pastime.

As Shruti, an 18-year-old pub-goer from Chandigarh, says, ""Beer is not an intoxicant. It's a social lubricant."" Alcohol becomes an excuse for everything. If you're too shy to talk to a girl, rum will give you courage; if you're not fitting in with your peers what's a vodka if it means acceptance.

Peer pressure as always can be tortuous and as Deepa, a fresher at a Mumbai college puts it, ""If you say no you could be alone for the entire evening and labelled a spoilsport. So what's the big deal in a couple of beers?"" Dilip, a third-year student explains soothingly, ""The next morning the maximum you have is a headache.""

If only it was that simple. Sanjay Sahney knows, for he too began with a glass of beer just to be part of the crowd. An engineering student in Mumbai, the metropolis was a different world for this insular Indore boy.

No parents to note his movements, a rich girlfriend who enjoyed frequenting the city's hot spots, life was that cliched ""big party"", he says. Except that one glass of beer grew to a bottle, one bottle grew to four a day. ""I used to crave for the high because it left me happy.""

Except that his grades slipped and he fell into debt, till a student counsellor sent him to Seva Dan, an NGO that works with alcohol and drug abusers. Today, eight months later, Sahney is limping back to normalcy.

In the heat of the moment, young men are too busy to realise that the confidence a bellyful of beer brings is entirely false and often dangerous. They strut out of bars ready to do Michael Schumacher impersonations on city roads only to wind up sober in the morgue.

Similarly, a brain addled by too many whiskies emboldens shy young men and leads them into risky sexual behaviour. ""They consume alcohol to get the confidence ... and then they visit prostitutes,"" says Sekhar Sheshadri, additional professor of psychiatry, NIMHANS. A scary corollary to this is another NIMHANS study which reveals that 70 per cent of HIV patients are alcoholics, especially teenagers.

The best way to control the problem is to make it more difficult for youngsters to find a drink. Liquor shops must insist on proof of age. The best way to control the problem is to make it more difficult for youngsters to find a drink. Liquor shops must insist on proof of age.

As alcohol abuse grows it becomes a significant crutch and much like Asterix, young people believe that one sip of this magic potion is all it takes. A survey of 3,000 class 10 students by Seva Dan in 13 schools in Mumbai revealed some frightening figures.

Forty-eight per cent of the children didn't think that alcohol was harmful, 47 per cent said it helped gain confidence and 52 per cent said it helped decrease mental tension.

If parents are slow to recognise their child is stressed, they take a mild view if their children toss back a few even if they haven't reached the legal age. As Panjab University sociologist Rajesh Gill says, ""It's no longer stigmatised."" The comments are not out of place.

A fortnight ago, Sanjeev Verma, owner of Wild West, one of Chandigarh's oldest pubs, was told by a father that he wanted beer served at his son's school passing-out party. A manager of a bowling company in Mumbai concurs: ""We have the right to refuse but if a parent asks for a pitcher of beer and pours his teenage son a glassful we are helpless.""

Not all parents grant their children a drinking license. Yet when both parents work and attempt to compensate for their absence by doling out large sums of pocket money, it can be a dangerous indulgence.

It is a situation that is compounded by the easy availability of alcohol, says Vimla Nadkarni, professor at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai. Unlike most western countries where only the flash of a required ID is a passport to a drink, laws in India are loosely enforced.

Eighteen may be the legal age to ask for a beer but one round of the pubs in any city confirms that few bartenders have ever heard of it. And there are certainly no shortage of pubs. Six years ago, Chandigarh, a city of white beards, had just two pubs; today there are 26.

Excise Department rules also stipulate that a liquor outlet must not come up within 100 m of an educational institution or religious place, but it is a rule easily flouted. Governments see no sin in being casual, blinded as they may be by profits.

In Maharashtra, the excise income from sales of beer, IMFL, and wine in 1997-98 was Rs 774.79 crore; in 1998-99 it is expected to be Rs 1,023.23 crore.

Naturally, teenage alcoholism is also on the rise. According to studies done by the De-Addiction Centre at AIIMS in Delhi, every fifth teenager in the 15-19 age group in the capital drinks regularly and around three lakh are addicted.

Another one lakh, it is estimated, need medical attention for alcohol-related disorders. Says H.K. Sharma, a social scientist who was associated with the studies: ""Any party or get-together is incomplete without corks popping open. It's a whirlpool into which children get sucked so easily.""

To alter established mind-sets, to convince a generation that the buzz that comes with a beer has dangerous implications, requires a mammoth effort.

Counsellors stress that parents must start communicating with their children, identify reasons for their stress and not turn away with a grin when junior steals a peg of whisky from daddy's cabinet. In fact, some Mumbai colleges have already put up posters that read, ""Drinking with Dad is also Bad"".

The most basic of all prevention is enforcing the ban on sale to those under 18. The harder it is for kids to find a drink the better it is. As Y.G. Rajalakshmi Parthasarathy, dean of the Chennai's Padma Seshadri group of schools insists: ""Age certificates have to be made a must.""

Chennai Police say they conduct surprise raids in front of schools on Saturday nights when teenagers are prone to drink and drive, but it's not enough.

Also, a society that merely smirks at underage kids trying to find some machismo in a beer mug needs to understand there's nothing amusing in it. The journey from recreation to addiction, or to death in a Zen at 19, is not a long one.

Currently shooting for Madhur Bhandarkar’s Fashion where he is playing a gay character, Harsh Chhaya speaks to Shruti Vashist about his journey from being a TV actor to working in films.

Q. Tell us about your role in Fashion.

A. In the movie, I am playing a gay fashion designer. We just started shooting for the movie this month and it has already been quite an experience for me. While I haven’t changed my lifestyle or the way I look physically, I have to walk, talk and behave in a certain manner which complements my character. This has really been an ‘out-of-body’ experience for me that I have enjoyed doing so far.

Harsh Chhaya Harsh Chhaya

A. I heard that Madhur Bhandarkar was making this movie. I really liked the concept of it and shot myself with a home video camera for the auditions of the various roles in the movie. I presented it to Bhandarkar and, within a few days, I got a call from him. I was happy to get this particular role because Bollywood rarely offers experimental roles like this.

Q. How has the transition from TV to films been?

A. Well, I have done TV for many many years now and that can sometimes go against you as an actor. As an accomplished TV actor, I have to face a lot of resistance from the film world. So it is almost like starting from scratch. For whatever reason, I have not been offered too many film roles and would like to do more work. Fashion will help me prove to people that I am a versatile actor and hopefully get me more offers.

Q. What’s in the pipeline?

A. I will be seen in a comedy called Oh God No God with director Saurabh Srivastav which stars Divya Dutta and Vinay Pathak. Another upcoming venture is Dhuan, which will be directed by Mrinalini Dayal and is based on an issue very relevant today.

Q. Your views on anything Gujarati?

A. Although I don’t know much about Gujarati cinema, as I have been born and brought up in Delhi, they seem to be too stuck on traditional plots. While my father is from Vadodara, I have relatives in Gujarat in the interiors like Surendranagar and Limbdi. There is stuff about Gujarat which amuses me like the alcoholics anonymous in a totally dry state!

Anita Nair's Ladies Coupe: A brilliant evocation of sisterhood on the move,Book review of Anita Nair's 'Ladies Coupe'.,,2012-10-29T12:52:51+05:30,"By Anita Nair

Penguin



In the flood of ""Wimmen's writing"" that depicts women as battered, bartered and abandoned on the shoals of low self worth, Anita Nair's second novel rides triumphantly against the tide. Second novel? Is it possible? The ink has barely dried on Nair's first one, The Better Man, that trawled with intent through fiction's latest heart of darkness, the matrilineal murkdom of Kerala, when she's produced another one.

The better woman: A store of revelatory life-affirming tales The better woman: A store of revelatory life-affirming tales

Apparently, Nair's imagination teems with stories that leap out like tiny silver fish, struggling to escape a fisherman's basket. As though to acknowledge the fact, she has signalled that her book is ""a novel in parts"" and indeed she seems more adept at stringing together a collection of short stories than in going for the long haul.

In Ladies Coupe Nair has resorted to one of the oldest ploys. She has taken a leaf out of Chaucer's mixed crowd of pilgrims travelling to Canterbury telling tales to each other. He himself, as is well known, borrowed from Boccacio who had his well-heeled cast of characters relating stories to each other while sitting out the plague. Nair's characters too are singularly life affirming.

Though they do not confess their life stories publicly to each other while sitting in what used to be a regular feature of rail journeys, the ""ladies compartment"" or coupe of the title, the manner in which she has them sharing their experiences with the protagonist, Akhila or Akhilandeswari, as she becomes towards the end, assuming her full potential as a woman, quite often sounds like a female version of Alcoholics Anonymous.



Excerpt Akhila dreams: a train that trundles, truckles and troops into a station. Akhila is seated by a window. Everything but the train is still. The moon hangs at her shoulder and rides with her. She travels through a gallery of nightscapes, each framed by the window. A light in a house. A family huddled around a fire. A howling dog. A distant town. Black oily waters of a river. A menacing hill. A curling road. A railway-crossing with the streetlight glinting on the glasses of a man on a static scooter, hands dangling at his side, heel on the ground, head cocked, watching, waiting for the train to hurtle past. At the station, portraits replace impressions. Reunions. Farewells. A smile. Tears. Anger. Irritation. Anxiety. Boredom. Stillness. Akhila sees them all. The train begins to move.

Akhila dreams of being there. And not there. Of adding a memory by the moment.

Were the railways providing a hitherto unknown service to the sisterhood of women by throwing them in together for a night and a day of bonding through the boondocks of the Indian countryside? We shall never know. Part of the charm of Nair's narrative is that we are lulled into accepting her thesis.

Once locked in together, it's a question of age no bar, caste no bar, sex no bar, indeed the intimacy with which the ladies discuss their sexual adventures seems to underline the message that ""having sex"" is destiny.



Akhila herself is the magnet for their stories. She has suddenly decided to take her life in her hands. At the age of 45, having achieved near anonymity working as a clerk in the Income Tax Department she is suddenly filled with the idea of revolt. She decides to bolt, to take a long train journey to Kanyakumari.

Are there shades of an Anita Brookner heroine here, encased in stiffly starched cotton saris and the disappointments of a lifetime of sacrifice travelling to her own Hotel Sea Breeze by the seafront? Though she might lack the subtlety of a Brookner heroine, Akhila is not without her desires.

There's a hilarious description of her singular form of revolt when she wants to taste a boiled egg brought by an Anglo-Indian colleague to work and, much later, a tense moment when she discovers herself responding to the anonymous groping of a man's hand in a crowded bus.



Nair's evocation of the ordinariness of a middle-class Brahmin family struggling to keep itself afloat in Chennai, hanging on to the rigid pattern of their lives, as exemplified in the patterns of kolam traced in front of their houses and expecting an unquestioning sacrifice from the women in the family to underwrite this myth, is what powers her narrative.



Akhila and her friends are on the threshold of self-discovery. The manner in which Nair relates these transformations is in turn revelatory and redeeming. Her tale is light enough to relieve the tedium of a long journey and yet filled with the incantatory power to burn up the tracks, to seek a new destination. To change.","['sisterhood', 'brilliant', 'akhila', 'life', 'novel', 'revelatory', 'evocation', 'train', 'women', 'ladies', 'woman', 'long', 'coupe', 'anita', 'nairs']","By Anita NairPenguinIn the flood of ""Wimmen's writing"" that depicts women as battered, bartered and abandoned on the shoals of low self worth, Anita Nair's second novel rides triumphantly against the tide.

New studies: Drug abuse among women is no longer a fringe issue,New studies on substance abuse among women convey a scary message: drug abuse among women is no longer a fringe issue.,,2012-08-08T13:19:39+05:30,"The sensational bust of big-time cocaine-seller Ali and businessman Neeraj Wadhera in Delhi last year may have exposed the city's social underbelly. But the most startling revelation was the number of coke-snorting women who figured among Ali's rich clients.

However, the case did nothing to dispel the widely held notion that women hooked to drugs belonged to two extreme ends of the social scale. One, a battered slum dweller or a humiliated sex worker for whom drug addiction means survival. The other, a rich, high society woman who copes with the ""pressures of a demanding life"" by taking drugs.



The glaring omission in the guesstimates was the number of educated, working, middle-class women hooked to drugs. Now, there are definite indicators based on recent trends. Two new studies released last week by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MSJE) and the South Asia regional office of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) as part of a national survey on drug abuse in India, bust the myths around ""the type of women who take drugs"". The theme is academic but the message is clear and alarming-drug abuse among women is not a fringe issue anymore.



A Rapid Assessment Study conducted in nine urban areas as part of the UNDCP project reveals that younger, educated women are more prone to drugs, unsafe injecting methods and sexual practices. One of the findings was that a large number of female drug users were single: 75 per cent in Hyderabad, 60 per cent in Thiruvananthapuram and 75 per cent in Goa.

The respondents from Goa were also highly educated (37 per cent were graduates). What may finally force one to look beyond cliched reasons for drug use is that taking drugs purely for pleasure was one of the reasons women cited for their addiction. The other study was conducted by Dr Pratima Murthy, associate professor of psychiatry at NIMHANS, Bangalore.



""The notion that women take drugs only because of stress is no longer the single, undisputed truth,"" she says, warning that the study figures should not be used to make generalisations about Indian society. However, she does agree that ""drug abuse is becoming popular in the urban middle classes, especially among those who represent India's phase of transition"".



It is also not just the snort of cocaine or the high of heroin that drives women, say mental health professionals. Abuse of prescription drugs from the benzodiazepine group like Alprax, Calmpose, Valium, Trika, Restill, Placedox and Alzolam is a growing trend.

Natasha Singh-the Delhi-based socialite who reportedly consumed a heavy dose of Alprax on a regular basis and died after a fall from a hotel in March this year-obviously wasn't a solitary example. ""I see four to six cases every day involving either dependence on sedatives or abuse,"" says Delhi-based psychiatrist Sanjay Chugh, who thinks escapism is an inescapable urge among urban drug users. Take Namita.

At 1.30 in the morning, just after a party, she realised she had run out of Calmpose. From a smart, amiable hostess in capris and figure-hugging top, Namita turned into an agitated woman who ""wanted"" Calmpose at any cost. ""I take it when I can't sleep, when I'm tense, even when I want to have sex. Sometimes, I take it in the middle of a tension-spiked working day as well. I just can't do without it,"" she says.



Murthy's study covered Delhi, Mumbai and Aizawl and the findings of women on drugs fit the new profile. While the maximum number of women are hooked to brown sugar (see box), other preferred drugs are narcotic analgesics, tranquillisers, alcohol, cough syrups and cannabis. A fact reflected often in the newsmaking trends of Delhi.

In Murthy's study, however, it was in the Manipur capital of Aizawl that narcotic analgesics were the most preferred. According to a Mumbai-based psychotherapist, cocaine is favoured in the city as compared to prescription drugs or sedative painkillers. ""Cocaine reflects status as it is an expensive party drug and women are not sucked into judgmental traps by others in their groups because everybody is using it,"" she says.





While most of the reasons behind women taking to drugs now mirror those of men, everyday life as a drug user or the journey into rehab and back to sobriety is lonelier and tougher for women. Sushma Bhatia*, a 37-year-old educated Delhi housewife, is an alcoholic and a drug addict with two kids and an alcoholic husband. Sharing her experiences in a women's chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Bhatia says her life as an alcoholic is far more devastating in terms of emotional and social consequences than a man's.

Bhatia took to alcohol seven years ago when one day ""I was feeling completely rotten about myself and the way my husband behaved with me after he got drunk"". She experimented with cocaine as well. Soon, she would start drinking after sending her kids to school. One day, after a near-nervous breakdown, she collapsed and had to be carried to a rehab centre.



""Women no longer take drugs only due to stress but also for pleasure.""



For 43-year-old Banita Muralidharan*, a corporate executive, the problem was only alcoholism. She was asked to quit on ""grounds of indecent behaviour"". Muralidharan, who is single, says her friends deserted her, making the urge to kick the addiction very difficult.

""Female addicts are seen as doubly deviant,"" explains Sheigla Murphy, director of the Center for Substance Abuse Studies at the California-based Institute for Scientific Analysis in a report published on the Internet.

This is because traditional expectations of a self-sacrificing woman are at variance with that of a woman so selfish as to use drugs for her own pleasure. Seema Kejriwal*, who, as a supportive wife of an alcoholic, attends AA meetings, agrees.

Kejriwal has stood by her husband, supporting him emotionally and financially for nine years as he battled with his addiction. ""We were reduced to poverty and I had to take a job to support us, leaving my two-year-old son with a man who could not tell the day from night,"" she says, adding that she is fully aware of the fact that had she been in the same situation, her husband would have thrown her out long ago.

Compounding these problems are the effects of drugs on the physical and mental health of women. Studies have proved that women have a higher risk than men to addiction to certain drugs such as crack cocaine, even after casual or experimental use. In Murthy's study, respondents reported insomnia, menstrual irregularities, depression and anxiety.

Some even suffered miscarriages or were forced to undergo pregnancy terminations. ""Pregnant women who take alcohol or abuse drugs,"" says Delhi-based gynaecologist Sohani Verma, ""are also more prone to having children with congenital defects or Foetal Alcohol Syndrome.

While pregnant women on drugs can go into premature labour, babies suffering from FA S are usually underweight and often have defects such as mental retardation, delayed development and, as they grow older, behaviour problems. A scary price to pay for a ""kick"" that only briefly masks the pain of reality.","['addiction', 'drugs', 'day', 'issue', 'women', 'fringe', 'study', 'woman', 'longer', 'cocaine', 'studies', 'abuse', 'social', 'drug']","One, a battered slum dweller or a humiliated sex worker for whom drug addiction means survival.
The glaring omission in the guesstimates was the number of educated, working, middle-class women hooked to drugs.
The theme is academic but the message is clear and alarming-drug abuse among women is not a fringe issue anymore.
However, she does agree that ""drug abuse is becoming popular in the urban middle classes, especially among those who represent India's phase of transition"".
""Pregnant women who take alcohol or abuse drugs,"" says Delhi-based gynaecologist Sohani Verma, ""are also more prone to having children with congenital defects or Foetal Alcohol Syndrome."

Substance use disorder occurs when a person needs alcohol or another substance (drug) to function normally. Abruptly stopping the substance leads to withdrawal symptoms.

Addiction means that a person has a strong urge to use the substance and cannot stop, even if they want to. Tolerance to a substance (needing a higher dose to get the same effect) is usually part of addiction.

This disorder is also called substance abuse.

Alternative Names

Substance abuse; Chemical use; Chemical abuse; Drug addiction; Addiction - drug; Dependence on drugs

Causes

The exact cause of substance use disorder is not known. A persons genes, the action of the drug, peer pressure, emotional distress, anxiety , depression , and environmental stress can all be factors.

At least half of those who become addicted have depression , attention deficit disorder , post-traumatic stress disorder , or another mental problem. A stressful or chaotic lifestyle and low self-esteem are also common.

Children who grow up seeing their parents using drugs may have a high risk of developing an addiction later in life for both environmental and genetic reasons.

Commonly abused substances include:

Opiates and narcotics are powerful painkillers that cause drowsiness and sometimes intense feelings of well-being, elation, happiness, excitement, and joy. These include heroin, opium, codeine, and narcotic pain medicines that may be prescribed by a doctor or bought illegally.

that may be prescribed by a doctor or bought illegally. Stimulants are drugs that stimulate the brain and nervous system. They include amphetamines, cocaine , and drugs used to treat ADHD, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin). A person can start needing higher amounts of these drugs to feel the same effect.

, and drugs used to treat ADHD, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin). A person can start needing higher amounts of these drugs to feel the same effect. Depressants cause drowsiness and reduce anxiety. They include alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines (Valium, Ativan, Xanax), chloral hydrate, and paraldehyde. Using these substances can lead to addiction.

LSD, mescaline, psilocybin (""mushrooms""), and phencyclidine (PCP or ""angel dust"") can cause a person to see things that are not there (hallucinations) and can lead to psychological addiction.

Marijuana (cannabis) and hashish

There are several stages of drug use that may lead to addiction. Young people seem to move more quickly through the stages than do adults. Stages are:

Experimental use -- typically involves peers, done for recreational use; the user may enjoy defying parents or other authority figures.

Regular use -- the user misses more and more school or work; worries about losing drug source; uses drugs to ""fix"" negative feelings; begins to stay away from friends and family; may change friends to those who are regular users; shows increased tolerance and ability to ""handle"" the drug.

Problem or risky use -- the user loses any motivation; does not care about school and work; has obvious behavior changes; thinking about drug use is more important than all other interests, including relationships; the user becomes secretive; may begin dealing drugs to help support habit; use of other, harder drugs may increase; legal problems may increase.

Addiction (dependence) -- cannot face daily life without drugs; denies problem; physical condition gets worse; loss of ""control"" over use; may become suicidal; financial and legal problems get worse; may have broken ties with family members or friends.



Symptoms

Symptoms and behaviors of drug useinclude:

Confusion

Continuing to use drugs even when health, work, or family are being harmed

Episodes of violence

Hostility when confronted about drug dependence

Lack of control over drug abuse - being unable to stop or reduce alcohol intake

Making excuses to use drugs

Missing work or school, or a decrease in performance

Need for daily or regular drug use to function

Neglecting to eat

Not caringabout physical appearance

No longer taking part in activities because of drug abuse

Secretive behavior to hide drug use

Using drugs even when alone



Exams and Tests

Drug tests (toxicology screens) on blood and urine samples can show many chemicals and drugs in the body. How sensitive the test is depends on the drug itself, when the drug was taken, and the testing laboratory. Blood tests are more likely to find a drug than urine tests, though urine drug screens are done more often.

Treatment

Substance use disorder is a serious condition and not easy to treat. The best care and treatment involves trained professionals.

Treatmentbegins with recognizing the problem. Though ""denial"" is a common symptom of addiction, people who are addicted have far less denial if they are treated with empathy and respect, rather than told what to do or being confronted.

The substance may either be slowly withdrawn or stopped abruptly. Support for physical and emotional symptoms, as well as staying drug free (abstinence) are also key to treatment:

People with drug overdose may need emergency treatment in the hospital. The exact treatment depends on the drug used.

Detoxification (detox) is the withdrawal of the substance abruptly in an environment where there is good support. Detoxification can be done on an inpatient or outpatient basis.

At times, another drug with a similar action or effect on the body is taken, as the dose is slowly decreased to reduce the side effects and risks of withdrawal. For example, with narcotic addiction, methadone or similar drugs may be used to prevent withdrawal and continued use.

Residential treatment programs monitor and address possible withdrawal symptoms and behaviors. These programs use techniques to get users to recognize their behaviors and learn how not to go back to using (relapse).

If the person also has depression or another mental health disorder, it should be treated. In many cases, a person starts using drugs to try to self-treat mental illness.



Support Groups

Many support groups are available in the community. They include Narcotics Anonymous (NA), Alateen, and Al-Anon. Most of these groups follow the 12-Step program used in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). SMART Recovery and LifeRing are programs that do not use the 12-step approach. You can find other support groups on the internet.

Outlook (Prognosis)

Substance use may lead to a fatal overdose. Some people start taking thesubstances again (relapse) after they have stopped.

Complications of substance use include:

Depression

Cancer-- for example, mouth and stomach cancer are linked to alcohol abuse and dependence

Infection with HIV, or hepatitis B or C through shared needles

Loss of job

Problems with memory and concentration-- for example with hallucinogen use, including marijuana (THC)

Problems with the law

Relationship breakup

Unsafe sexual practices, which may result in unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV, or hepatitis B



When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you or a family member is addicted to drugs and would like to get off of them. Also call if you have been cut off from your drug supply and are at risk of withdrawal. Most employers also offer referral services for their employees with substance use problems.

Prevention

Drug education programs can be helpful. Parents can have a strong influence on their children by teaching them about the harms of using substances.

Alcoholism is sometimes a response to an intolerable situation which can be made more bearable by drinking. Hence the right cure would be to find the root of the problem instead of fighting it with drugs or aversion therapy.

Shimla Vivek Mohan

I am a self-confessed alcoholic. Alcoholism is no respector of any human being. I took my first drink thinking it would bring me more pleasure, more friends, more status but this was only a pleasant delusion. The last five years of my sojourn with alcohol were terrible. I pawned and sold everything to buy more alcohol. I made countless resolutions, broke every one, was hospitalised thrice and underwent psychiatric treatment. Nothing made a difference. Only Alcoholics Anonymous did. Their one day at a time rule is indeed a golden rule.

Bombay Ganesh

Drinking has become a social necessity and man's social status seems to rise or fall with the quality and quantity of liquor he is able to hand out. A non-drinker finds himself isolated at any function and to be accepted as a civilised individual he begins to drink. Even more distressing is the fact that youngsters have taken to it in a big way simply because it is equated with manliness.

Chandrapur Prakash Prabharat

I believe that Hindi films contribute largely to the growing popular appeal of drinking in this country. Nearly every film has the hero guzzling booze (generally a bottle of Vat 69) and looking very pleased with himself. The same man is shown young and carefree, dancing with the heroine, righting all manner of people in the most outrageous situations for his self-respect. And finally comes tragedy. The audience identifies with him and imitates him completely, even throwing back drinks like he did, not bothering to see the bottle for its evil.

Rajkot D.P. Bhatt

The cover story did not shock, it only surprised. It is only expected that alcoholism will increase with population. This means that there is more frustration and deterioration of morals. Eradication is impossible.

Bombay S.E. Meeuza

An alcoholic is not just the problem of his family but should also be the concern of the society in general. As he is a public nuisance, neighbours should join together to humiliate him. This method has been successful in Manipur, where the women have got together to deal with the problem.

Nagpur Manoj Bire

Alcoholism is a socially accepted evil which has assumed insidious dimensions. Only a mass-based movement, which by its very nature enjoys wide popular backing, can help the people in their battle against the bottle.

Pathankot Ravi Kant Bhatia

Your intention to educate people about alcoholism is well-timed. Arrack sale legalised a few years back in Tamil Nadu has unfortunately increased the number of its consumers. Alcoholics, many of them in a highly inebriated state, can now be seen drinking till the wee hours in arrack shops. The income generated is enormous and all this at the expense of the working class whose women and children suffer.

Nandanam Franklyn Stanley

Considering the climate in this country, alcohol is injurious to drinkers. But the state governments will not bring in total prohibition. The lobby of vested interests argues that prohibition will only be an incentive to illicit distilling and bootlegging, which is a loss to the Government. This is a fallacious argument for the brewing of raw drink is common and uncontrolled. Illicit distillation is mainly on economic grounds and has nothing to do with prohibition.

In north-eastern India alcohol has become the root cause of all evil in society. Country liquor is cheaply and freely available and has devastating effects. Facilities for de-addiction should be provided in this part of the country too.

Absurd Reading

Reading your story ""Communal Cauldron"", April 30), one would imagine that the Hindus went on a rampage merely because they were working under the Muslims who controlled the business. That sounds absurd because the losses of the other community have not been considered a loss, and neither has the viewpoint of the oppressing community been taken. Had there been violence on the scale you write about there would have been a retaliatory strike.

Information

MARIJUANA

Marijuana is also called ""grass,"" ""pot,"" ""reefer,"" ""joint,"" ""hashish,"" ""cannabis,"" ""weed,"" and ""Mary Jane.""

About 2 in 5 Americans have used marijuana at least once in their life.

Marijuana comes from a plant called hemp (Cannabis sativa). The main, active ingredient in marijuana is THC (short for delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol). This and other ingredients, called cannabinoids, are found in the leaves and flowering parts of the marijuana plant. Hashish is a substance taken from the tops of female marijuana plants. It contains the highest amount of THC.

How fast you feel the effects of marijuana depend on how you use it:

If you breathe in marijuana smoke (such as from a joint or pipe), you may feel the effects within seconds to several minutes.

If you eat foods containing the drug (such as ""hash brownies,"") you may feel the effects within 30 - 60 minutes.

Marijuana acts on your central nervous system. Low to moderate amounts of the drug may cause:

Increased appetite (""the munchies"")

Feeling of joy (euphoria)

Relaxed feeling

Increased sensations of sight, hearing, and taste

Other effects can include:

Feelings of panic

Anxiety

Excessive fear (paranoia)

Decreased ability to perform tasks that require coordination (such as driving a car)

Decreased interest in completing tasks

Delirium

Firmly held false beliefs (delusions)

Seeing or hearing things that arent there (hallucinations)

Bloodshot eyes

Increased heart rate and blood pressure

Infections such as sinusitis , bronchitis , and asthma in heavy users

Irritation of the airways causing narrowing or spasms

Possibly weakening of the immune system

Sore throat

Trouble concentrating and paying attention, which can interfere with learning

Trouble telling oneself from others

Violence (may be related to marijuana that is laced with a drug called PCP)

Regular users may have withdrawal effects when they stop marijuana use. These may include:

Agitation

Anxiety

Insomnia

The medical use of marijuana is controversial, yet its active ingredient (THC) is legal for medical purposes in at least 16 states. (Whole marijuana is illegal, even for medical use.)

THC has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the following medical purposes:

Relieving chronic pain and spasticity

Stimulating appetite in patients with AIDS or who have undergone chemotherapy

Treating glaucoma

Treating nausea caused by chemotherapy in cancer patients

PHENCYCLIDINE (PCP, ""angel dust"")

PCP is an illegal drug that comes as a white powder, which can be dissolved in alcohol or water. PCP may be smoked, shot into a vein, or taken by mouth. How quickly it affects you depends on how you take it.

Shooting up: If given through a vein, PCPs effects start within 2-5 minutes.

Smoked: The effects begin within 2 - 5 minutes, peaking at 15 - 30 minutes.

Taken by mouth: In pill form, or mixed with food or drinks, PCPs effects usually start within 30 minutes. The effects tend to peak in about 2 - 5 hours.

Different doses of PCP may cause different effects:

Lower doses of PCP typically produce feelings of joy (euphoria) and less inhibition, similar to being drunk.

Higher doses can cause numbness throughout the body, and perception changes that may lead to extreme anxiety and violence.

Large doses may produce paranoia, ""hearing voices"" (auditory hallucinations), and other forms of psychosis , similar to schizophrenia .

, similar to . Massive doses, usually from taking the drug by mouth, may cause kidney failure , heart arrhythmias , muscle rigidity , seizures , and even death.

Because of the pain-killing ( analgesic ) properties of PCP, users who get seriously injured may not feel any pain.

LSD AND OTHER HALLUCINOGENS

LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) is a strong hallucinogen. Only tiny amounts are needed to cause effects, such as hallucinations.

LSD use may cause:

Anxiety

Blurred vision

Dilated pupils

Seeing things that arent there ( hallucinations )

) Paranoia and other delusions

Tremors

Other commonly abused hallucinogens include:

Psilocybin (mushrooms, ""'shrooms"")

Peyote (a cactus plant containing the active ingredient mescaline)

Hallucinogens can lead to extreme anxiety and loss of touch with reality, called ""bad trips"". These experiences can come back as a ""flashback,"" even without using the drug again. Such experiences typically occur during times of increased stress, and tend to occur less often and intensely after stopping the drugs.

COCAINE

Cocaine is a strong stimulant. The abuse of cocaine increased dramatically in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but is now on the decline. Other names to describe different forms of cocaine include ""crack,"" ""coke,"" ""snow,"" and ""speedball.""

Cocaine may be taken in different ways:

Snorting: Inhaling it through the nose

Shooting up: Dissolving it in water and injecting it into a vein

Speedball: Mixing with heroin and injecting into a vein

Smoked: Cocaine may be changed into smokeable forms known as freebase or crack

Smoking cocaine typically produces a nearly instant and intense sense of joy (euphoria). Other effects include:

Feelings of increased confidence and energy

Less inhibition

Local numbness

Regular users of cocaine may need larger amounts of the drug to feel these effects. Regular users of cocaine may develop:

Loss of interest in school, work, family, and friends

Memory loss

Mood swings

Sleep problems

Social withdrawal

Heart disease and other blood vessel disease

A hole in the septum that separates the nostrils

Heavy use may cause paranoia, which can lead to violence.

AMPHETAMINES

Amphetamines are stimulants. Other names used to describe amphetamines or methamphetamines include ""crystal,"" ""go,"" ""crank,"" and ""cross-tops.""

Amphetamines can be very addictive. Prescription amphetamines are considered controlled substances. Over-the-counter (OTC) amphetamine look-alike drugs are often abused. These drugs typically contain caffeine and other stimulants, and are sold as appetite suppressants or stay-awake/stay-alert aids.

Signs and symptoms of stimulant use include:

Dilated pupils

Exaggerated feeling of well-being (euphoria)

Fast heart rate

Restlessness and hyperactivity

Skin flushing

Sleep disturbances

Tremors

Appetite decrease and weight loss

INHALANTS

Inhalant use became popular with young teens in the 1960s with ""glue sniffing."" Since then, a greater variety of inhalants have become popular. Inhalant use typically involves younger teens or school-age children.

Commonly abused inhalants include:

Aerosols for deodorants or hair sprays

Cleaning fluids

Gasoline

Liquid typewriter correction fluid

Model glue

Spray paints

Negative effects of inhalant abuse include:

Brain damage

Convulsions

Liver or kidney damage

Nerve damage ( peripheral neuropathy )

Sudden death

OPIATES, OPIOIDS, AND NARCOTICS

Opiates come from opium poppies. These drugs include morphine and codeine. Opioids are artificial substances that have the same effect as morphine or codeine. The term ""narcotic"" refers to either type of drug.

Narcotics are powerful painkillers that cause drowsiness (sedation) and, sometimes, feelings of euphoria.

These drugs include:

Codeine

Heroin

Hydromorphone (Dilaudid)

Methadone

Meperidine (Demerol)

Opium

Oxycodone (Percocet or Oxycontin)

Signs and symptoms of narcotic use include:

Sedation

Needle marks on the skin (""tracks""), scars or abscesses if drug use is by injection

if drug use is by injection Relaxed or euphoric state

Small ""pinpoint"" pupils

Coma, respiratory depression, and death in high doses

Because heroin is commonly injected into a vein (used intravenously), there are health concerns about sharing contaminated needles among IV drug users. Complications of sharing contaminated needles include hepatitis , HIV infection, and AIDS .

CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSANTS

These substances produce sedating and anxiety-reducing effects, which may be therapeutic in some cases and lead to abuse or dependence in others.

These types of drugs include:

Alcohol

Barbiturates (e.g. amobarbital, pentobarbital, secobarbital), also called ""yellow jackets""

Benzodiazepines (e.g. Valium, Ativan, Xanax)

Chloral hydrate

Paraldehyde

Signs and symptoms of excessive alcohol or other depressant use include:

Decreased attention span

Impaired judgment

Lack of coordination

Slurred speech

OTHER DRUGS

A number of other illegal drugs have become popular and available in recent years, including:

Ketamine, a substance related to PCP, commonly called ""Special K""

""Ecstasy,"" or MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine)

GHB and Rohypnol, also called ""date rape,"" ""acquaintance rape,"" or ""drug-assisted assault"" drugs

Pop star Britney Spears is left ""devastated"" after her former lover and a hero pilot, who helped her quit booze, has been killed by the Taliban in Afghanistan.

John Sundahl's helicopter was shot down near Kabul where he had been working for several months as a private contractor ferrying officials across the war-torn country.

The 44-year-old's brother Karl said: ""It's heartbreaking - John went there to try to repair the country.

They remained friends after their romance ended but were said to have reignited their relationship last summer.

A source close to Britney, who has sons Jayden James, 8, and Sean Preston, 9, with ex-husband Kevin Federline, 36, said: ""She is devastated. Britney thought he was a lovely man.""

Speaking from his home in Los Angeles, his brother Karl told how John died.

""John was on a journey from Kabul when he was shot at and killed. We were told by the State that John had died, they told us the Taliban did it. This is just awful. My family are heartbroken, my parents are elderly so this is very tough for them, and all of us. We know Britney's upset too.

""John was still good friends with Britney, he talked to her regularly. They dated for a while but always kept in touch afterwards,"" the Mirror quoted him as saying.

John's body was repatriated to the US last week and a small family funeral was held at a Buddhist temple in LA.","['britney', 'afghan', 'ended', 'john', 'relationship', 'killed', 'romance', 'reignited', 'exlover', 'taliban', 'remained', 'told', 'friends', 'spears']","Britney remained friends with John after their romance ended but were said to have reignited their relationship last summer.

I am anguished by the immorality of means and the crude tactics adopted by the Rao Government to defeat the no-confidence motion sponsored by the combined opposition (""A Battered PM"", August 15). Never in the past had a government at the Centre stooped to ignoble means like using money and indulging in horse-trading to remain in power. While the Congress(I) has only served to further erode morality in public life, the moral authority of the Government to rule the country has been undermined. Hyderabad s.b. singh

The role played by Mulayam Singh Yadav in the survival of the Congress(I) Government cannot be easily dismissed. He nurtures dreams of becoming chief minister of Uttar Pradesh by riding on Narasimha Rao's shoulders. But are these weak shoulders capable of carrying him? Dehra Dun shailendra seinger

RAO IS IRREPLACEABLE

The opinion poll (' 'Three Way Split"", August 15) reveals two very interesting aspects of the public mood. They are: the emerging consensus on the Ram Mandir and Rao's lead in comparison to other prime ministerial hopefuls. Isn't it ironical that Rao still commands confidence in spite of the scandals besieging him? This only highlights the sad fact that there is an absolute lack of credible leaders in the country. Pune vijayan b.

Your electoral prediction does not take into account political parties other than the main three-Congress(I), bjp. National Front-Left Front combine. The smaller, regional parties play a crucial role in determining the result in a general election. Madras c.t. vairavan

The opinion poll only highlights how short public memory is and the ease with which politicians manipulate the minds of the people. This is reflected in the way political equations have undergone a complete change within a short span of six months. But the sad part is that we Indians are caught between the devil and the deep sea. Even if there is a mid-term poll, there isn't much to choose from. Indore ananth srinivas

Your story based on the marg poll seems to have been cooked up within the four walls of your office. If you think there is no bjp wave, all you need to do is hold a mid-term poll to find out the truth. The way the bjp has grown in the past few years is only because of the personality of L.K. Advani. I do not believe that he comes fourth in the race for prime minister. Next time you publish a so-called opinion poll, make sure that you present it in such a way that it does not look or sound so made-up. New Delhi asha prabha

CRIMINAL FARCE

This is a case of grotesque juxtaposition (""Gunning for Cover"", August 15). Men who are facing criminal charges are being protected by the state while it is society which needs protection from them. And the very same state is, on the other hand, fighting these men in the courts.

THE TIME CRUNCH

It is hard to believe that bereft of its Air Time Committee (atc), Doordarshan was unable to evolve reasonable criteria for allotting time slots on its satellite channels (""Air Time Inanities"", August 15). If that was really the case, one is hard put to explain dd's success on its two channels. Besides, it will be grossly underestimating the Indian bureaucracy's sophistication to blame it on plain incompetence. The real reason perhaps was the time crunch. Hyderabad Dr codadu pratap

STILL SMOKY

One can't be certain even now whether the cbi will be able, or allowed, to produce clinching evidence linking Rajiv Gandhi with the Bofors pay-off (""The Smoke Clears August 15). But it doesn't really matter. Anyone who believes that the late prime minister was not one of the beneficiaries must be naive or a fool. Or Mani Shankar Aiyar. Bangalore k.r. narayanaswamy

LET REASON REIGN

Your story on the rationalist movement (""The Triumph of Reason"", August 15) was refreshing. People need to emerge from the shadows of astrology and superstition. They need to discover that success depends on the work of their hands and not on the lines on their palms. On the other hand, it is necessary to realise that science too is not infallible. When I was at school we were taught that neutrons were the smallest particles. Now we have discovered neutrinos and quarks. Kanpur chhotechai

BIG BUSYBODY

By forcing Russia to backtrack on its deal with India to supply cryogenic rocket technology (""Misguided Muscle"", August 15), Uncle Sam has clearly proved that in addition to its many faults, it is also the biggest busybody in the world. By his abject surrender to US blackmail, Boris Yeltsin has damaged his own stature and credibility. I'm certain the Russian President would even roll over and play dead if his American masters asked him to. New Delhi samir mahajan

The US has once again established its credentials as a 'world policeman' by forcing Russia to break its agreement with India. Obviously the US is concerned about our success in space technology and wants to protect its own multimillion-dollar arms market. The Government must provide adequate funds, necessary facilities and moral support to our technocrats and scientists to undertake a space research programme to devise an indigenous substitute for the cryogenic engine technology.

CLEANING THE CAPITAL

The most important thing is to control the menace of air pollution (""Capital Punishment"", August 15). The main culprit is the ever increasing number of vehicles on the road. It is, therefore, imperative that air pollution control leg- islation be strictly implemented immediately. The authorities should be equipped with modern gadgets to check the levels of emission and must be empowered to file cases against the defaulters. Above all, the courts should decide cases promptly in order to deter offenders. New Delhi k.k. bajaj

The problems of Delhi, so professionally summed up by you, are really well known. What is lacking is any long-term plan to tackle them with sincerity and determination. The greatest need at the moment is to set up an efficient transport system by implementing the Metropolitan Rapid Transport System through public and private funding. A few zones in the city could be declared out of bounds for private vehicles. Pedestrian plazas will cut down traffic snarls in the congested areas. If none of these plans work and things continue to deteriorate, we could shift the capital elsewhere and hope that history does not repeat itself. Bangalore d.b.n. murthy

In a typically Indian way we will all complain about our suffering, vehemently discuss Delhi's problems till we tire ourselves and then continue life as before. Nobody will take the initiative and take the necessary decisions. Ideas and proposals will be written down and then be lost in the bureaucratic jungle. New Delhi thomas and nancy niggli

STRESS ON QUANTITY

Your special survey on housing (""Building on Shortages"", August 15) was enlightening and relevant. However, you have not stressed the necessity of building large-scale low-cost housing. For most people interested in just finding a roof over their heads, fancy flats and bungalows are out of reach. There must be emphasis on the construction of inexpensive dwellings and importance should be given to utility and comfort rather than merely style and decor. Panchkula, Haryana alokgupta

DENIGRATING OURSELVES

Your tribute to A.K. Ramanujan (""Without Obituary"", August 15) cites the MacArthur prize as ""the highest critical accolade in the US"", while the Sahitya Akademi is called ""puny"". The former, established by an insurance tycoon, is nothing more than a monetary award given to dozens every year-well known and obscure, accomplished and potentially outstanding-merely to relieve them of the need to chase money. Do we still need to drool over any little recognition abroad while denigrating our own institutions? Madras s. ashok

MIRACULOUS MATA

The sarcasm and tone of your story on Mata Amritanandamayi, is intolerable (""The Gurus For the '90s"". July 31). My wife and I were deemed by doctors to be infertile but we were blessed with a child only by her divine grace and love. Amma's children shed tears of joy and relief lying in her lap. We offer these tears to our Mata. What qualification, what spiritual authority do you possess to write about one who is the divine mother of the universe? Madras t.n. krishnachandran

Mata Amritanandamayi, who you have written so harshly about, is the ambrosia that saved my husband's life and restored our domestic harmony. He was an alcoholic and smoking for over a decade. Then, just one confession to the Mata brought about a transformation which neither the Alcoholics Anonymous nor a clinical psychologist was able to bring about. I will be eternally grateful to her.

A QUESTION OF TRUST

Lt-General A.S. Bhullar, director-general, Bureau of Indian Standards (bis), is right in saying in his letter that the bis is the first organisation to issue quality system certificates. But Indian Register Quality Systems (irqs), a department of Indian Register of Shipping, is the first duly accredited Indian organisation for certification of quality systems (""Certified Fit"", Trade Winds, May 31). The certification system of the bis has not been independently verified as meeting internationally accepted criteria for certification bodies, unlike irqs which has been accredited by Raad voor de Certifi-catie of the Netherlands. Consequently, the bis certificate may not be easily accepted by importers abroad. This is not to say that the bis system is inferior. What is urgently needed is a national accreditation system and organisation-like the UK's National Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies- as recommended by the EC experts' group.

'Drunchies' behind youth obesity epidemic,,,2018-08-08T13:06:00+05:30,"Washington, Aug 8 (PTI) Drunchies, or the desire to eat salty, unhealthy foods after a night of heavy drinking, may be contributing to the obesity epidemic among college students, scientists say.

Researchers from University at Buffalo in the US decided to look at a sample of 286 college students to better understand how drinking affects what they eat, both that night and for their first meal the next day when, most likely, they are hungover.

""Given the obesity epidemic and the rates of alcohol consumption on college campuses, we need to be aware of not only the negative effect of alcohol consumption, but also the impact it has on what people are eating while they are drinking,"" said Jessica Kruger, an assistant professor at the University at Buffalo.

Research on the effects of drinking and diet is scarce, Kruger said, adding that eating more unhealthy foods following alcohol consumption is an often overlooked behaviour in traditional addiction research.

The inspiration for the study, published in the Californian Journal of Health Promotion, came from an ad researchers saw in a university newspaper.

""It said, 'Got Drunchies?' and had ads for pizza, tacos, and other fast-food places that were open late after the bars closed,"" Kruger said.

An average beer contains 150 calories. If a person drinks five beers, it accounts for third of their daily energy intake. Add two slices of pizza or a burrito to that at the end of the night, and it's a recipe for weight gain, she said.

""So, we dug a bit deeper and first figured out what the 'drunchies' were, and then decided this would be interesting to study,"" Kruger said.

Study participants were asked to complete an anonymous online survey.

Researchers found that drinking influenced study participants' dietary behaviours before going to bed.

All alcohol drinkers were more likely to eat something before they went to bed after drinking alcohol than in general before they go to bed.

Specifically, they were more likely to opt for salty snack foods and pizza. Healthy foods, such as dark green vegetables and other veggies they would ordinarily eat, were not as appealing.

Of particular concern, the researchers noted, was the fact that participants did not report drinking more water or other non-alcoholic beverages before bed.

That exacerbates dehydration, which may lead to additionally unhealthy food choices.

The following day after drinking, participants' dietary patterns varied from the night before. They were less likely to skip meals the morning after a night of drinking compared to a typical morning.

They favoured foods like pizza or tacos over milk and dairy products and grains, most likely because of the so-called hangover cures that get passed down to students and which entail eating foods that ""soak up"" the alcohol.

Dispelling these myths is one way to promote a healthy diet even after a night of binge drinking, Kruger said. PTI MHN MHN","['participants', 'obesity', 'night', 'pizza', 'eat', 'epidemic', 'drinking', 'youth', 'drunchies', 'kruger', 'university', 'likely', 'foods', 'alcohol']","Washington, Aug 8 (PTI) Drunchies, or the desire to eat salty, unhealthy foods after a night of heavy drinking, may be contributing to the obesity epidemic among college students, scientists say.

How to survive -40 degree Celsius winter? Quora user reveals chilling details,How do you survive in cripplingly cold temperatures? A Quora user who spent some time in a remote Siberian town explained in great detail what life is like in -20 to -40 degree Celsius winters.,,2019-01-21T13:30:00+05:30,"For people who live in the tropics, we have a majority of seasons to enjoy every year. The blossom of the leaves and flowers in spring, the heat wave in summers and the snowfall in winters, or the trees shedding leaves in autumn.

But for people higher up, near the poles, just mere survival can be a Herculean task. Hear it from the horse's mouth.

An anonymous Quora user has thrown light on the unimaginable lives of people living in extremely cold temperatures in places like Siberia, and it is chilling to say the least. Literally.

The user mentions spending a winter in a remote Siberian town where the temperatures remained below -20 degree Celsius throughout. On some days, the mercury further droped to -40 degree Celsius.

The hard-hitting insight into an average day of a person's life in this town will leave you in shock.

In a 14-point list, the user provides a pretty challenging picture of everyday survival in such extremely cold temperatures. The user writes about wearing layers over layers of clothing, learning the art of cleaning an animal carcass, collecting wood from the jungle to keep your home warm each day and takes readers through numerous other realities that are just too difficult to imagine from our cosy 20-degree-Celsius winters.

""If you can put in a thin shirt underneath your fur coats, you put it in,"" the user writes.

Eliminating the option of feasting on greens, the user declares that for most people, they can be unaffordable. Focusing on the importance of preserving and pickling veggies during the summer, the user writes, ""There are no veggies to eat. There are no fruits. Those who can afford them, are usually the oligarchs who come to visit their mansions for fun. Canada might have, because it has world’s largest food producer just next to it. Fatty meats, milks fats, milk, and some roots and tubers.""

The simple act of 'breathing' can be daunting in -20 degree Celsius. The user points out that due to 'dry air', every breath you breathe out will push water out of your body, thus making your lungs dry and causing 'breath burns'. Sounds scary, doesn't it?

The user writes, ""You might want to replenish the fluids in your body, even when you’re inside. Light alcohol, helps. Of course, then the legendary vodka. But once the alcohol effects are dimmed, you feel more cold. So you need to keep drinking.""

The user continues, ""In remote areas, nights can get dark. People will not have windows, and if anyone has, they will fill it up with winter covers, which basically means putting several wood boards. Nights are dark. Pitch black dark if you get even about 100 meters away from the civilisation. You can’t see your own hands or body. You need to have sufficient lighting. The more batteries the better.""

Diesel fuel run cars are completely missing from this town, according to the user. 'Gas' run automobiles are the prime alternative. The user explains, ""You should have gas generators, gas cars, gas everything. Diesel will gel up, diesel engines can’t start combustion, or there must be specially designed engines, which have spark plugs. You don’t shut off the car unless you get everything you need. You will sometimes need to heat up the car before starting it, because it just won’t start.""

The user's post makes you realise the importance of finding a hunt each day, among many things. Describing the scanty availability of food, the writer stresses on not wasting any edible part of an animal's body and consuming all that can be had. The user writes, ""You learn to kill and clean a carcass. Really. Deer, horse, and whatever animal you come across."" Talking about animal meat, the person says, ""You don’t waste any body parts. You will clean off the large intestine of all the poop and eat whatever part is edible. You eat the heart, brains, and even break up the bones sometimes for the marrow. Of a horse or a reindeer out of a 100kg carcass, 20kg is the highest amount that should go waste. The skins, are used. The most expert folks will be able to reduce the wastage to 16-18kg. The amazing thing is, eating up all the body parts, ensures that people are never ever deficient in any macro or micro nutrients.""

We hope that was not gory for you.

""Metal is no good. If the temperatures drop, the metal can become brittle. It doesn’t conserve heat. It conducts heat too well. Wood. Wood. Wood. Your body will stick to metal. Wood is the way to go. You can't burn metal. You can burn wood,"" the user explains.

Everything is valuable for survival in these temperatures, 'wood' being extremely important in these circumstances. The user writes, ""You don’t keep fuel in your home. Fuel means wood. Butane and propane are cute. But you don’t have enough to stock up for the entire winter. Once winter starts, you can’t get more either. You can always go into the forests and get more wood.""

Taking us further through the nerve-racking details, the user explains the hazards related to the simple act of 'sweating'. Comparing sweating to death, the user explains sweating resulting in a phenomenon called 'sweat ice', that can potentially prove fatal. ""You don’t want to sweat. So you don’t heat your home too much. You sweat, you die. You want to work hard, okay. BUT DO NOT SWEAT. SWEAT = DEATH. Sweat will go into your clothes. Water is a good conductor of heat, way better than air. You will get cold. If you sweat too much, your clothes will freeze and stick to your skin. The sweat ice will kill you in a few hours. If you sweat, wipe it off, and if you’re in home and you sweat, open the door to cool down the home. YOU DON’T SWEAT,"" they write.

Haryana government admits to possibility of mass rapes in Murthal,The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Monday castigated the Haryana Police for suppressing the facts pertaining to the alleged Murthal mass rapes.,,2016-04-12T08:33:13+05:30,"Around 20 women claimed to have been raped by agitators. At least 30 people were killed and over 300 injured in the nine-day-long Jat agitation in Haryana.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Monday castigated the Haryana Police for suppressing the facts pertaining to the alleged Murthal mass rapes.

In another development the state government - which earlier denied that no rapes were reported during the Jat agitation - admitted to the possibility of rapes during the hearing.

The Haryana government was further embarrassed when the police, which had also earlier denied that no rapes took place during the nine-day Jat agitation, told the court that they were investigating two complaints filed by alleged rape victims.

Submitting the SIT report in the form of an affidavit, Murthal gangrape SIT chief IG Mamta Singh informed the court that the police have included Section 376-D (rape) of the Indian Penal Code to FIR No 118 registered on March 30, 2016.

Belongings of alleged rape victims were found on streets Belongings of alleged rape victims were found on streets

The section has been included on the basis of complaint of Delhi resident that women were allegedly sexually assaulted by the agitators. The state government said it had received anonymous letters alleging that the rapes took place.

""The anonymous letter forwarded by CP Faridabad vide letter dated March 1, 2016 to SP Sonipat which was further forwarded to Special Group of officers by SP Sonipat on March 2 and the letter from a non-resident Indian forwarded by a news channel on March 2016 was also taken on record. Since the content of both communications reveals commission of offence under Section 376 of the IPC, the relevant Section has been added on the basis of the content and further investigation will be conducted on these communications to verify the content of communication,"" the affidavit submitted by Haryana police said.

""Efforts have been made to identify the victim of these two communications. Keeping in view the sensitivity of the matter, utmost care has been taken to keep secret the identity of the victim, if the communication is substantiated, and victim is identified,"" the affidavit added.

So far, three alleged rape victims have surfaced. One of the victims is a final year degree student, who was present on the street along with her father. The second woman who has alleged rape is a resident of Patparganj in New Delhi. She has spoken to amicus curiae Anupam Gupta. The third alleged victim is an Australian woman whose complaint was also forwarded to the police.

The court also questioned the state government on the appointment of the Parkash Singh Committee to look into the incidents of violence during the Jat agitation, asking it to clarify its constitutional and legal status.

""We have been taken for enough rides. We won't be taken for one more. The police only registered FIR after we pulled them. After the court pulled them up, the police have now conditionally accepted the rapes. I have video tapes of Murthal victim's statement,"" Gupta said.

Meanwhile, a Chandigarhbased NGO, Haryana Human Rights has said it will file a contempt petition against former SIT chief Dr Rajshree as she misled the court and the media.

The court, which took a suo motu notice of the reports in the media about the mass rapes, had asked the Haryana government and police to submit a status report. At least 30 people were killed and over 320 injured in the nine-day long Jat agitation for reservation.

Confessions corner! The untold story of an IPL cheerleader,"An American cheerleader, who's been entertaining cricket enthusiasts for past three months in the ongoing IPL 8 season, disclosed the inside story and the hazards of her profession.",,2015-05-13T16:00:44+05:30,"An American cheerleader, a graduate in anthropology, disclosed the hazards of her profession An American cheerleader, a graduate in anthropology, disclosed the hazards of her profession

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have barred the much-hyped and equally controversial cheerleaders from interacting with the cricketers during the eighth edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL). But, that didn't deter an IPL cheerleader from revealing her league experience on the social networking website Reddit.

The IPL cheerleader, who chose to be anonymous and went by the moniker IPLCheer, participated in Reddit's AMA (ask me anything) live chat to disclose the experience and hazards of her jobs.

Reddit's AMA that saw popular Bollywood stars Priyanka Chopra and Imran Khan make candid confessions last year witnessed yet another exciting Q&A event with over 500 responses.

""I'm a bit late for this scheduled AMA. But I'm here! I'll try to answer everyone's question. Ask me anything! :)"" the IPL cheerleader began.

Here's a look at some of the interesting revelations by the IPL cheerleader:

Q. How did you went on entering IPL and becoming IPL cheerleader?

A. I'm on a dance contract through an agency in Mumbai. I do background dancing for Bollywood music videos as well. (No, none of them have come out yet) I was thrown into the IPL gig because of my dance background.

Q. Do players hit on you?

A. No, they ignore us for the most part. We're not allowed to talk to each other.

Q. Is there a rule for official party n gathering? Last week in Bangalore I did see a Australian cricketer talking with a bunch of cheerleader for about 20-30 min at bar/pub post game ..funny thing he refused to talk to almost every guy /fan who approached him.

A. I know that one team of girls got to meet the players because they did a commercial together. Aside from that I've been under the impression that all teams and all members couldn't chat up the cheerleaders. But maybe it's different for different teams.



Q. What is the funniest thing you ever saw a cricket fan doing in a stadium?

A. Honestly? I put a blank stare on for the most part when I'm facing the crowd. There's just so many nasty men making kissy faces and taking my picture that I tend to just block it all out. Often I'll lock eyes with some nice people that are smiling and those are the people I'll focus on for most of the game. So I haven't really seen many funny things. If someone genuinely made me laugh though, that would be a welcome thing.

Q. Are you a feminist? What are your thoughts on cheerleading being a means to objectify women as sexual objects and especially in India as a white relic.

A. I am a feminist, and I admit that I am bothered. When I danced in my home country I felt less like that. If you were to watch female dancers on Broadway, regardless of their outfit, you probably wouldn't call them a sexual object. You'd call them a dancer. I went into this contract as a dancer, finding that I'm treated more as a sex object.

I try to be forgiving of human nature so I'm rolling with the punches. I also enjoy what I do regardless. But I wouldn't renew this contract for another year unless things changed.

Q. How often do you get ogled on stadium while dancing? And how do you feel when you get ogled so much?

A. All the time. I hate it.

Q. What is the biggest thing you hate about your job? A few spectators near me were shouting abusive and cheap words at the cheerleaders. How do you cope up with stuff like that?

A. I hate the racism. Why is my team made up of 99 per cent white girls? Why do Indians feel it's ok to dress white girls up in skimpy outfits but they wont let their fellow Indian women do it? It's messed up. But for the most part I can't hear them. The music is loud enough and the accents are thick enough I'm mostly oblivious to the words. This doesn't mean I can't tell that there are some obvious slime-balls behind me. I try my best to ignore them. And I've made a personal rule for myself not to take pictures with fans unless they're women or children. I'm not keen on becoming someone's fap bate for the night.

Q. As we Indians are quite new to seeing cheerleaders, what are few things about cheerleading that you think we don't know, but should know about?

A. We're not all sluts. You might get the odd one or two out there in the world, but the mass majority of cheerleaders I've worked with are perfectly respectable women. I'm currently not working with any sluts, and for that I'm grateful. They tend to cause drama.

Q. Any insider story you might be aware of related to Match Fixing/late Night parties/Any sort of Harassment?

A. I've only heard rumors of fixed matched from people completely unrelated to IPL. Doesn't mean it doesn't happen. Us girls have had parties with just ourselves on a few occasions, but we're not allowed to hang out with the cricketers.

Q. What kind of hotels do they provide? I assumed it was 5 star hotels.

A. The first two games they were more like 1 star hotels. Cockroaches, I saw a rat and rat droppings, it was pretty bad. But we quickly spoke up and realized our manager for that trip had been skimping us and pocketing the money he was saving on a cheaper hotel. Now they're more like 3 star. Perfectly comfortable but not over the top.

Q. What's the alcohol situation like over there? Can you just buy a case of beer and bring it back to your hotel room to drink with your colleagues?

A. Some states are dry so you can't bring alcohol back. But when the states aren't dry, we have brought beer and vodka back to our rooms to celebrate.

Q. You think cricket is a game where cheerleading makes sense? Do you feel the flow of the game lends to cheerleading or does it feel forced?

A. Yeah, I feel cheerleading fits well. The 4s and 6s are the main reason for this, and the breaks give ample time to pump up the crowd and cheer for the team.

Q. It must be very exhausting to dance every 5 or 10 minutes in searing hot weather. What do you do keep energy levels high? What's your diet & training regimen like?

A. The heat gets annoying. I try to embrace it. The energy is just part of the job. We have to appear upbeat even if we're exhausted. I'm a vegetarian, I try to stay away from too many fried foods and too much sugar, but I do enjoy chocolate and an occasional samosa.

Q. What's your regimen like? Do you secretly wish that the batsmen of your team got out faster, so that you wouldn't have to dance so much?

A. No way! The games are always so much more fun if we're winning. It's much more boring to sit in a chair than it is to dance. I wasn't a cricket fan before this, but I am now!

Q. When was the cricket ball closest to you? During a boundary I mean. Are there any experiences with the ball?

A. It's never been really close unfortunately. Sometimes I daydream about it coming right at me and I catch it like a badass before going up and dancing. I'd end the dance with a mic drop with my pom poms and walk off the stage.

Q. As a fellow western woman living in India, not sure how I feel about white cheerleaders at the games. Why not Indian cheerleaders?

A. I agree. I love doing it, but I'd honestly prefer to see at least a mix of Indian women. Sadly there's nothing I can do about that. If I refuse I'd be breaking my contract and they'd replace me with another white girl anyway.

Q. Where do you hail from? How has been your overall experience in India?

A. I'm not saying where I'm from to protect my identity. But I'm from a western country. So far I've been loving India. I might be a rare Westerner in that I love the chaos here. People are living, kids playing cricket in the streets, goats and cows wondering around, people selling fruits and veggies on corners, I love it. It beats the closed off living you'll find in major cities in the U.S. the U.K. or Australia.

Q. Did you ever have plans to study at University? What would you like to study if you got a chance?

A. I'm a University graduate. I studied anthropology.

Q. IPL or Superbowl?

A. IPL. I just don't care for American football. It has always bored me.","['try', 'feel', 'corner', 'dance', 'ipl', 'cheerleader', 'cheerleaders', 'women', 'cricket', 'im', 'untold', 'white', 'confessions']","But, that didn't deter an IPL cheerleader from revealing her league experience on the social networking website Reddit.

India's hidden years of nuns abused by priests,"The stories spill out in the sitting rooms of Catholic convents, where portraits of Jesus keep watch and fans spin quietly overhead. They spill out in church meeting halls bathed in fluorescent lights, and over cups of cheap instant coffee in convent kitchens.",,2019-01-02T15:21:00+05:30,"A Catholic nun stands at the foyer of the St. Francis Mission Home in Kuravilangad in the southern Indian state of Kerala.

The stories spill out in the sitting rooms of Catholic convents, where portraits of Jesus keep watch and fans spin quietly overhead. They spill out in church meeting halls bathed in fluorescent lights, and over cups of cheap instant coffee in convent kitchens. Always, the stories come haltingly, quietly. Sometimes, the nuns speak at little more than a whisper.

Across India, the nuns talk of priests who pushed into their bedrooms and of priests who pressured them to turn close friendships into sex. They talk about being groped and kissed, of hands pressed against them by men they were raised to believe were representatives of Jesus Christ.

""He was drunk,"" said one nun, beginning her story. ""You don't know how to say no,"" said another.

At its most grim, the nuns speak of repeated rapes, and of a Catholic hierarchy that did little to protect them.

The Vatican has long been aware of nuns sexually abused by priests and bishops in Asia, Europe, South America and Africa, but it has done very little to stop it, The Associated Press reported last year.

Now, the AP has investigated the situation in a single country - India - and uncovered a decades-long history of nuns enduring sexual abuse from within the church. Nuns described in detail the sexual pressure they endured from priests, and nearly two dozen other people - nuns, former nuns and priests, and others - said they had direct knowledge of such incidents.

Still, the scale of the problem in India remains unclear, cloaked by a powerful culture of silence. Many nuns believe abuse is commonplace, insisting most sisters can at least tell of fending off a priest's sexual advances. Some believe it is rare. Almost none, though, talk about it readily, and most speak only on the condition they not be identified.

But this summer, one Indian nun forced the issue into the open.

When repeated complaints to church officials brought no response, the 44-year-old nun filed a police complaint against the bishop who oversees her religious order, accusing him of raping her 13 times over two years. Soon after, a group of her fellow nuns launched a two-week public protest in India's Catholic heartland, demanding the bishop's arrest.

It was an unprecedented action, dividing India's Catholic community. Inside the accuser's convent in rural Kerala state, she and the nuns who support her are now pariahs, isolated from the other sisters, many of whom insist the bishop is innocent. The protesting nuns get hate mail and avoid going out.

""Some people are accusing us of working against the church, of being against the church. They say, 'You are worshipping Satan,'"" said one supporter, Sister Josephine Villoonnickal. ""But we need to stand up for the truth.""

Villoonnickal has been a nun for 23 years, joining when she was a teenager. She scoffs at the idea that she wants to harm the church.

""We want to die as sisters,"" she said.

___

Some nuns' accounts date back decades - like that of the sister, barely out of her teens, who was teaching in a Catholic school in the early 1990s.

It was exhausting work, and she was looking forward to the chance to reflect on what had led her - happily - to convent life.

""We have kind of a retreat before we renew our vows,"" she said, sitting in the painfully neat sitting room of her big-city convent, where doilies cover most every surface, chairs are lined up in rows and the blare of horns drifts in through open windows. ""We take one week off and we go for prayers and silence.""

She had traveled to a New Delhi retreat center, a collection of concrete buildings where she gathered with other young nuns. A priest was there to lead the sisters in reflection.

The nun, who like others interviewed for this story spoke on condition she not be identified, is a strong and forceful woman who has spent years working with India's poor and dispossessed, from battered wives to evicted families.

But when she talks about the retreat her voice grows quiet, as if she's afraid to be overheard in the empty room: ""I felt this person, maybe he had some thoughts, some attraction.""

He was in his 60s. She was four decades younger.

One night, the priest went to a neighborhood party. He came back late, after 9:30 p.m., and knocked at her room.

?'I need to meet you,'"" he said when she cracked open the door, insisting he wanted to discuss her spiritual life. She could smell the alcohol.

""You're not stable. I'm not ready to meet you,"" she told him.

But the priest forced open the door. He tried to kiss her. He grabbed at her body, groping wherever he could.

Weeping, she pushed him back enough to slam the door and lock it.

It wasn't rape. She knows it could have been so much worse. But decades later she still reels at the memory, and this tough woman, for a few moments, looks like a scared young girl: ""It was such a terrifying experience.""

Afterward she quietly told her mother superior, who allowed her to avoid other meetings with the priest. She also wrote an anonymous letter to church officials, which she thinks may have led to the priest being re-assigned.

But nothing was said aloud. There were no public reprimands, no warnings to the many nuns the priest would work with through his long career.

She was too afraid to challenge him openly.

""I couldn't imagine taking that stand. It was too scary,"" she said. ""For me it was risking my own vocation.""

So the fierce nun remained silent.

___

Catholic history is filled with women who became martyrs to their own purity: Saint Agatha had her breasts torn off for refusing to marry; Saint Lucy was burned alive and stabbed in the throat for defending her virginity; Saint Maria Goretti was 11 years old when she was killed by a man who tried to rape her.

""It is a sin!"" Maria is said to have cried out. ""God does not want it!""

But for a nun, fighting off a priest's advances means pinballing through centuries-old sexual and clerical traditions. Celibacy is a cornerstone of Catholic religious life, as is sexual purity among nuns. Many nuns say a sister who admits to a sexual experience - even if it's forced - faces the risk of isolation within her order, and possibly even expulsion.

""You're not sure if you'll be kept in your congregation, because so much is about your vow of chastity,"" said Sister Shalini Mulackal, a New Delhi-based theologian. ""That fear is there for the young ones to disclose what has happened to them.""

At the same time, priests are seen as living representatives of Christ, with obedience to them another Catholic cornerstone.

Then there is the isolation of young women struggling to find their way in new communities after leaving their homes.

Caught at this intersection of sexual taboo, Catholic hierarchy and loneliness, sisters can be left at the mercy of predatory priests.

""There's a lot of emotion bottled up and when a little tenderness is shown by somebody it can be so easy for you to cross boundaries,"" said Sister Dorothy Fernandes, who has spent years working with the urban poor in eastern India. ""It can be hard to tell what is love and what is exploitation.""

It's particularly hard for sisters from Kerala, a deeply conservative region long the birthplace of most Indian nuns. Sex is rarely mentioned openly in small-town Kerala, boys and girls are largely kept apart, and a visible bra strap can be a minor crisis for a young woman.

""Once you grow up, once you get your first menstruation, you are not encouraged to speak normally to a boy. And the boys also vice-versa,"" said a nun from Kerala, a cheerful woman with sparkly glass earrings and an easy smile. She remembers the misery of Sunday mass as an adolescent, when boys would stand outside the church to watch girls filing in, eyes crawling over their young figures. ""We have a terrible taboo about sex.""

That naivety, she said, can be costly.

Like the time she was a novice nun, still in her teens, and an older priest came to the Catholic center where she worked. He was from Goa, a coastal region and former Portuguese colony.

She shook her head: ""I was in charge of visitors, and we had this bad habit of being hospitable.""

At one point, she brought the priest's laundry to his small room, where he was sitting. As she set down the clothes, he grabbed her and began to kiss her.

At first, she had no idea what was happening.

""The kissing was all coming here,"" she said, gesturing at her chest.

The confusion of that day is still clear on her face: ""I was young. He was from Goa. I am from Kerala. In my mind I was trying to figure out: 'Is this the way that Goans kiss?'""

She quickly understood what was happening but couldn't escape his fierce grip. She also could not call out for help: ""I cannot shout! He's a priest.""

""I didn't want to offend him. I didn't want to make him feel bad,"" she said.

So she pushed herself away from him until she could slip out the door.

She quietly told a senior nun to not send novices to the priest's room. But, like the nun who fought the drunken priest, she made no official complaint.

A complaint against a priest means leveling an accusation against someone higher in the church hierarchy. It can mean getting pulled into a tangle of malicious rumors and church politics. It means risking your reputation, and the reputation of your order.

In the church, even some of those who doubt there is widespread abuse of nuns say the silence can be enveloping.

Archbishop Kuriakose Bharanikulangara, a New Delhi-based church leader, calls incidents of abuse ""kind of sporadic. Once here, once there.""

But ""many people don't want to talk,"" he continued. ""They may talk in the community, but they don't want to bring it to the public, to the court.""

Speaking up can also risk financial troubles, since many congregations of nuns are financially subservient to priests and bishops.

The silence is magnified in India by demographics, religious politics and a deep-seated belief that women have little value.

There are roughly 18 million Catholics in India, but that's a small minority in this largely Hindu nation of 1.3 billion. Speaking up could tarnish the image of their church, many nuns worry, and feed criticism by Hindu hardliners.

""Even we, as religious sisters, even we try to keep it quiet,"" said Mulackal, the theologian. ""A woman who goes through this experience, she just wants to hide it and pretend everything is OK.""

___

The rapes, the nun says, happened in Room 20 of a small convent at the end of a one-lane road in rural Kerala.

Set amid rows of banana and rubber trees near the little town of Kuravilangad, the sisters at the St. Francis Mission Home spend their days in prayer or caring for the aged. In the garden, a statue of the Virgin Mary overlooks a decorative fish pond the size of a child's wading pool. The pond is covered in green scum.

The rapist, she says, was the most powerful man in this tiny small world: Bishop Franco Mulakkal.

Smart and ambitious, Mulakkal had risen from small-town Kerala to become a bishop in north India, overseeing a sprawling Catholic community. He was also the official patron of her community of 81 sisters, the Missionaries of Jesus, wielding immense influence over its budgets and job assignments.

The nun is a friendly woman with jet black hair known for her quiet confidence. Every few months, she says, Mulakkal would visit the St. Francis convent and summon her. Then, according to a letter she wrote to church officials, he raped her.

The letter says the first rape happened on May 5, 2014. The last time was Sept. 23, 2016. The dates are recorded in the convent's visitor logs.

Mulakkal angrily denies the accusations, telling reporters the charges were ""baseless and concocted"" and accusing the sister of trying to blackmail him into giving her a better job.

""I am going through painful agony,"" said Mulakkal, who was jailed for three weeks and released on bail in October. ""I tell everyone to pray to God: Let the truth prevail.""

Catholicism envelopes this part of Kerala. Towns are marked by their cathedrals, convents and roadside shrines, where the Virgin watches passing traffic or St. George slays the dragon. Businesses proclaim their owners' faith: St. Mary's Furniture and Bed Center; Ave Maria Electronics; Jesus Oil Industries.

Around here, many see Mulakkal as a martyr.

A string of supporters visited him in jail, and crowds greeted him when he returned home, a ring of policemen holding back people who showered him with flower petals. ""Hearty Welcome!"" a banner proclaimed.

But at the St. Francis convent, one group of nuns watched news reports about that welcome with dismay. While the sister leveling the accusations against Mulakkal does not speak publicly, a half-dozen nuns cluster around her, offering support and speaking on her behalf.

""Nobody came to see sister, but so many people came to wait in line to meet Bishop Franco in jail,"" said Villoonnickal, the nun, who moved back to Kerala to support the woman she calls ""our survivor sister.""

That sister was the second of five children in a Kerala family. Her father was in the army. Her mother died when she was in high school. Wracked with grief, she was sent to stay with a cousin - a priest - living in north India. Inspired by her time with him, she became a nun in 1994, working in her early years as a teacher.

She knew Mulakkal, of course. Everyone in the Missionaries of Jesus knows him. But the two were never close, the accuser's friends say, and had no consensual sexual relationship.

It was about fear.

""The bishop is such a powerful person and standing against him, where will she go?"" asked Villoonnickal. ""If she went home what will happen to her?""

""Many times she was telling him to stop. But each time he was forcing himself on her,"" she continued.

Eventually, they say, she told some sisters what was happening. Then she says she repeatedly complained to church authorities. When nothing happened, she went to the police.

She also went to confession.

There, according to the other nuns, she was told she had to resist the bishop.

?'Even if you have to die, don't submit yourself.'"" the priest told her in confession, according to Villoonnickal. ""'Be courageous.'""

Catholic authorities have said little about the case, with India's Catholic Bishops' Conference saying in an October statement that it has no jurisdiction over individual bishops, and that the investigation and court case, which could take many years, must run their course.

""Silence should in no way be construed as siding with either of the two parties,"" the group said. ""We request prayers for the Church at this difficult time.""

In Malayalam, the language of Kerala, sisters who leave the convent are sometimes marked as ""Madhilu Chadi"" - Wall Jumpers. It's a mocking term for the sexually frustrated and is often used for nuns and priests who have fled religious life.

Those who stay get respect. They have communities that embrace them. Their lives have direction, purpose. Those who leave often find themselves adrift in India, searching for new identities and spurned by families and friends. The events that knit families together - weddings, funerals, reunions - are suddenly off-limits. The emotional toll can be immense.

Speaking up about the church's troubles, many nuns say, could end with them forced from their convents, cut off in many ways from what they've always known.

""It's a fear of being isolated if I speak the truth,"" said the nun who fought off the drunken priest. ""If you do that, you have to go against your own community, your own religious superiors.""

The result is an engulfing silence. Silence is the armor that sisters use to protect themselves and the lives they have created, even if it also means struggling with their memories, and protecting the men who abused them.

In the end, most say nothing.

Nuns described in detail the sexual pressure they endured from priests, and nearly two dozen other people - nuns, former nuns and priests, and others - said they had direct knowledge of such incidents.
Many nuns believe abuse is commonplace, insisting most sisters can at least tell of fending off a priest's sexual advances.

"Former Maharashtra CM Antulay faces cheating, bribery, extortion, corruption charges",Abdul Rehman Antulay is battling for survival in more ways than one. The former Maharashtra chief minister has been hospitalised for cardiac problems while disclosures in his court battle seem to have damaged his case and his future political career.,,2014-03-05T17:15:14+05:30,"Antulay in his hospital room: Back to the wall Antulay in his hospital room: Back to the wall

Abdul Rehman Antulay, former Maharashtra chief minister, arraigned for over three years for alleged corruption and other criminal offences, will most probably hear the judicial pronouncement on him lying in bed in his cabin on the tenth floor of Bombay Hospital.

He suffered a cardiac arrest on January 8. and was rushed to the intensive care unit where he lay for 25 days. A week before that, he and his fledgling Bharatiya Congress, comprising rebels from the Congress(I), were badly mauled in the Lok Sabha polls.

And now, as his trial enters the closing chapters in the court of Justice Dinshaw Merita at room No. 13 on the ground floor of the greystone Bombay High Court building, there are all signs of the one-time 'sultan' of Bombay running up against a solid and impregnable wall.

Justice Mehta will pronounce his judgement this fortnight on a complaint filed by Ramdas Nayak, a leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which said that the former chief minister had indulged in cheating, bribery, extortion and corruption during his term in office between June 1980 and January 1982.

The crux of the complaint is that Antulay had passed off his five personal trusts as government trusts and then collected donations for them from the public in consideration of distributing official largesses, such as cement, enhanced quota of industrial alcohol, and permissions to build and transact in real estate.

An adverse judgement could mean fines and a maximum punishment of up to seven years imprisonment, though the road of appeal to the Supreme Court would still be open to both the parties.

""I've given my life's best in this case. I sink or swim with it.""

Ram Jethmalani



As a senior counsel of the high court said: ""We've come close to a turning point in judicial history. No matter what the judge finally says, it'll be the first pronouncement by the judiciary on the honesty of a public servant following a complaint made not by the state but by a member of the public.""

Though Nayak is the main complainant in the case, it is his senior counsel. Ram Jethmalani, a former MP of the BJP and the country's ace criminal lawyer. who has stolen the show as Antulays' star adversary.

Jethmalani dug his teeth into the case as early as September 1981 - shortly after the media disclosures of Antulay's trust scandals - when he took up Nayak's brief on the criminal complaint simultaneously with the civil suit filed by Mrinal Gore, P.B. Sawant and others.

While Ashok Desai, another luminary of the Bombay bar, who was the counsel for Gore, was finally able to argue the case successfully, leading to Justice Lentin pronouncing that there was indeed a 'nexus' between the donations and the largesses, Jethmalani plodded along a more circuitous way to put Antulay in the dock for trial in the criminal case.

Jethmalani, and his suave, Oxford-educated son, Mahesh, have for the past few months slogged 14 hours a day on the case, returning all other briefs in dozens. Stacks of the files and papers related to the Antulay case have piled up on virtually every square-inch of available space in their Nariman Point office.

Though they have argued the case entirely free of cost, so high has been the public interest in it that donations amounting to nearly Rs 75,000 have come along to Nayak to meet the incidental expenses, often from anonymous contributors and in denominations as small as five rupees. Said an exhausted but unfazed Jethmalani: ""I've given my life's best in this case. I sink or swim with it.""

Antulay. on the other hand, had mostly reverses coming his way. His worries are hidden adroitly behind a screen of bluster. ""By God's grace, I shall win the case and prove that I'm the cleanest politician to take on Mr Clean,"" he says, archly referring to Rajiv Gandhi with his customary self-righteousness. But the die is clearly cast against him.

""There is very little hope left for Antulay really. All his braggadocio and rhetoric come from an illusion of power to which politicians often fall victim...""

Ashok Desai eminent lawyer



And Jethmalani feels he is getting closer to his quarry whom he has stalked all these years. He first ripped through Antulay's defence in 1982 when the Supreme Court upheld a high court judgement that the Maharashtra governor could sanction Antulay's trial without consulting the state cabinet, many of whose members were Antulay's cronies.

Thereafter. Antulay's second line of defence also came down crumbling: it was that being an MLA, he was a public servant, and therefore he could be tried only with the sanction of his 'appointing authority', the speaker of the Assembly.

The Supreme Court bluntly stated that an MLA was no public servant. Thus Antulay was up for trial by a special judge of Bombay High Court, on criminal charges, like any other ordinary accused.

Though the trial still has a long way to go - even if the charges are ordered to be framed, Antulay will have a right to cross-examine the witnesses all over again - the case has altered his quick. electric personality.

He now needs the support of a wall to shuffle up to the telephone, barely a few yards away from his bed. A connoisseur of sumptuous biryanis, he eats two frugal meals a day. There is a reiterative reference to 'God's court', as if the court on this side has already delivered its judgement. And, bereft of an inner will to battle on, his familiar smile, often found sinister by many, looks pathetically vacuous now.

The case, numbered Special Case 24 of 1982, was transferred for trial from the Supreme Court last year by the order of a five-judge bench. Since April last year, it has been heard for well over 80 days, involving 53 witnesses, and has hogged media space like no other case in recent times.

The essence of the complaint is that Antulay is guilty of having conceived a scheme of aggrandisement involving obtaining of funds from the public and then putting the funds substantially under his control. In the process, he is alleged to have committed offences of:

cheating, under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for having 'dishonestly induced' builders, sugar cooperatives capable of manufacturing industrial and potable alcohol, and property owners in making large contributions to the trusts;

extortion, under Section 384 of IPC, for having intentionally put the makers of alcohol in fear of losing business by imposing cuts on their licensed quota in order to secure donations from them:

bribery, under Section 161 and 165 of IPC, for having accepted illegal gratification by way of the donations in spite of being a public servant: and



corruption, being a public servant, as defined in Section 5 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.





The first major break in the ding-dong legal battle, however, came in the civil case when Justice Lentin of the Bombay High Court stayed the operation of the trusts' accounts in January 1982 and held that there was a quid pro quo involved in the donations made to them and favours shown to the donors. Antulay, who was at a meeting when the judgement came, drove straight to his residence, called a press conference, and announced his decision to resign.

But he was still able to block criminal proceedings on the ground that no chief minister could be tried without the governor's sanction for offences allegedly committed during his tenure in office. It took jethmalani six months. and two appeals, to get an order out of Supreme Court that the governor could indeed sanction such trial on his own, without consulting the cabinet, that is. The judgement came on July 27, 1982, and the Governor, I.H. Latif, gave his sanction the next day.

But Antulay's trial before a special judge again got interrupted by a shrewd defence argument that the assembly speaker's sanction was also necessary. After the Supreme Court also waved it aside, Justice S.N. Khatri was appointed trial judge and the trial began in right earnest in April 1984. In August. Justice Khatri resigned voluntarily following some charges levelled at him by the prosecution. and Justice Mehta stepped in.

The striking feature of the trial is that it combines the hearings with an ongoing investigation. Antulay had indeed been indicted by the press through a series of investigative reports long before the case went to court.

But the press focussed on circumstantial evidence which strongly, but obviously not conclusively. suggested that there was a link between the donations received by Antulay for the trusts and the favours shown to the donors by his government.

The thesis had to be proved in court, and what the prosecution needed were nuggets of solid documentary facts, which they could come by only if the state machinery did not stand in the way.

Ironically, the case reached its final crescendo soon after Mrs Gandhi's death on October 31 last year, when a number of state government officials, as though reassured by the fact that there would be no retribution for them if they came up with evidence, began coming forward as witnesses for the prosecution, providing crucial testimony, explaining various anomalies in the documents already placed before the court, and throwing new light on the bizarre working of the state Government under the controversial chief minister.

The most prominent among these witnesses were V.T. Chari and Vijay Singh. former secretaries in the department of food and civil supplies: L.S. Lulla, a former Maharashtra chief secretary who had officiated as officer-on-special duty (OSD) in Antulay's secretariat; additional chief secretary B.K. Halwe; D.V. Ekbote, a superintendent in the food and civil supplies department. Except Lulla, all of them are in government service now and it is the opinion of lawyers - without meaning any prejudice to the integrity of the witnesses - that the officials would have been ""inhibited"" had Vasantdada Patil. the Maharashtra chief minister and Antulay's staunch foe in the field of politics, not taken such a tough stand with regard to him.

""Who am I to encourage or discourage court witnesses?"" Patil asked India Today. But the officials in his government, one and all, sang in unison against Antulay at the court, levelling charges such as:

the written recommendations of Antulay for release of cement to builders who had donated money to his trusts were not recommendations but ""orders to be given effect to"";

Pesi D. Tata, Antulay's friend who died in 1982, was actually the link between him and the businessmen who benefited from ad hoc allotments of cement and alcohol quota;

that Antulay attempted to substitute official notes containing references to Pesi Tata by other notes, ""less embarrassing to the Government"", but also carrying his signature: and, that he indulged in overwriting on government files as the hearing on the earlier civil case began in September 1981, while he was still in office.





Also revealing are the depositions of builders, shopowners, manufacturers of industrial and potable alcohol and other private citizens who pointed accusing fingers at Antulay. Examples:

Rajan and Deepak Raheja of Rajdeep Raheja Constructions said Pesi Tata had approached them with the offer of cement against a donation of Rs 40 per bag to the trusts;

Mahesh Sadarangani of the K. Raheja group said that his company got 1,654 metric tonnes of cement after donating Rs 8,82,000 to KonkanUnnati Mitra Mandal, one of the trusts floated by Antulay;

Lalchand Rohra, Mukesh Dadiani and Ramesh Merchant of Nanubhai testified that they had donated Rs 8 lakh to the Indira Gandhi Pratibha Pratisthan (IGPP) in exchange for a no objection certificate (NOC) from Antulay to sub-let its premises to the Indo-Suez Bank at a rent of Rs 1.2 lakh per month. Merchant, who had once been Antulay's tailor, deposed that he negotiated the price with Antulay himself at Varsha, the chief minister's official residence in the Malabar Hills area, where Antulay demanded Rs 10 lakh but it was bargained down to Rs 8 lakh; and



Anilkumar S. Ruia, joint managing director of Kolhapur Sugar Mills, disclosed that his three companies paid Rs 4.25 lakh as donation to the Konkan Unnati Mitra Mandal in consideration of restoring cuts in their allotment of industrial alcohol, the figure being arrived at on the basis of ""25 paise per bulk litre"".





As against the impressive list of witnesses coming forward to depose against Antulay. those whose testimonies are regarded by the prosecution as ""hostile"" are very few: only Ajit Kerkar, managing director of India Hotel Company which owns the Taj group, and two builders, Niranjan Hiranandani and Mahendra Gala.

Both Hiranandani and Gala, who had obtained cement from Antulay's ad hoc quota and had also donated to his trusts, said the two had no interrelation, which negates the crux of the prosecution argument.

And Kerkar, who was himself a trustee on the IGPP, in addition to denying the suggestion of any quid pro quo, said that the Taj group had deposited Rs 1 crore with the Sethia Foundation Trust, yet another of Antulay's creations, not for any permission to build another Taj hotel on the premises of the National Council of Performing Arts (NCPA) at the prestigious Nariman Point but to ensure that the Taj employees, many of whom came from the Konkan area where the Sethia Trust proposed to set up a hospital, got medical facilities.

Antulay's two young counsels. Nitin Pradhan and Vidyasagar Kanade, exuding the never-say-die spirit, think there are yet some ""bright silver linings"" on the dark clouds created over the case by ""adverse media reportings on the trial"". According to Pradhan, the versions put out by Kerkar and the two other builders corroborate the defence contention that there was indeed no ""nexus"" between the donations and the official favours. He also thinks it involves stretching the Evidence Act ""a bit too far"" to prosecute his client largely on the basis of words and deeds of Tata, ""a man dead and gone long ago"".

But Mahesh Jethmalani thinks he and his father have an ""air-tight case"". Says Ashok Desai: ""There is very little hope left for Antulay really. All hisbrag-gadocio and rhetoric come from an illusion of power to which politicians often fall victim. It is ironic that even Antulay. who has a background in law, left his hoof marks all over on the files while taking decisions for which he was fit to be hauled over coals."" Desai should know, because he and Antulay did their bar-at-law in London together.

The present trial of Antulay defies all set categorisation because it is indeed difficult to say where prosecution begins and investigation ends. But, as the hearings end this fortnight, the judge may either dismiss the complaint, thus giving Antulay a clean chit, or ask the charges to be framed, which means admission of a prima facie case against him. That will leave Antulay with another opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses, and prove his innocence. But an order to frame the charges, if given, is a development serious enough because it will definitely amount to adverse judicial pronouncement on the former chief minister in a criminal case.

Though the court holds the key to Antulay's survival, it is by sheer force of habit that he is seeking election again in the assembly election from the Sriwardhan constituency in coastal Maharashtra. He may win simply because he led his nearest rival in the assembly segment by nearly 18,000 votes in the Lok Sabha elections. But full five fathoms deep lie his chances of getting immunity from law again as an mla in view of the earlier Supreme Court judgement.

Nor is there any hope that the Congress) I (leadership will extend its protective wing to him. Said Vasantdada Patil: ""I really don't know by what accident this Antulay became the chief minister of Maharashtra. His chief ministership was a disgraceful chapter anyway.""

Still, more than merely deciding the fate of Antulay, the clawing legal battle has derived its uniqueness from its unparalleled feature of combining trial with investigation. Witnesses have been called out not only to corroborate charges but to disclose new facts and unleash new evidence against the accused.

""What can I do."" asks Jethmalani, ""when the law does not permit me to seize documents firsthand and to get at the concrete facts?"" The trial has also redefined the level of public servants' immunity against law, and has broadened the scope and meaning of the word 'corruption' to include in its sweep even professedly altruistic exercises.

But, above all, and irrespective of Justice Mehta's final word on the case, it has shown the extent to which the court can go on doggedly pursuing a complaint when all other institutions of democracy seemed to have got stymied with fear and suspicion and the people had begun entertaining doubts about the fairness of the executive. The implications of the case have at last far surpassed Antulay, the man.","['extortion', 'antulay', 'cm', 'donations', 'cheating', 'antulays', 'chief', 'rs', 'corruption', 'case', 'faces', 'public', 'witnesses', 'maharashtra', 'bribery', 'charges', 'court', 'trial']","Stacks of the files and papers related to the Antulay case have piled up on virtually every square-inch of available space in their Nariman Point office.
Thus Antulay was up for trial by a special judge of Bombay High Court, on criminal charges, like any other ordinary accused.
But Antulay's trial before a special judge again got interrupted by a shrewd defence argument that the assembly speaker's sanction was also necessary.
""Who am I to encourage or discourage court witnesses?""
Said Vasantdada Patil: ""I really don't know by what accident this Antulay became the chief minister of Maharashtra."
Coconut water is the new cool drink,"There is already a little hint of the impending summer in the air, and soon the men selling tender coconut will take over the roadsides.",,2012-02-19T11:02:41+05:30,"There's already a little hint of the impending summer in the air, and soon the men selling tender coconut will take over the roadsides. When you see them the next time, treat them with a little more respect, for coconut water is the newest fashionable health drink in the West.

With just about no advertising, a little-known packed coconut water brand, VitaCoco, has driven US sales of the drink, which the Food and Agriculture Organisation describes as a ""natural isotonic beverage"", to $110 million (Rs 500 crore) - and it's double of last year's figures. Reporting the phenomenon, Beverage Daily.com quotes the research group, New Nutrition Business, as pegging the drink's European market at $65 million (Rs 325 crore), powered by the brand named Green Coco.

The news item tucked away in the world's leading source of food and beverage news made me check out VitaCoco's colourful website, and I must say I was struck by its fascinating story. It is one of those ideas that friends thrash about on a long boozy night and then forget once the cloud of alcohol settles the next day. But two childhood friends (and New Yorkers), Ira Liran and Michael Kirban, turned an idea they discussed at a Manhattan bar with two Brazilian women they were interested in (and who excitedly talked about the aqua de coco they drank back home) into a multi-million-dollar business.



Liran went to Brazil with one of their two companions for the evening (who eventually became his wife) to work in coconut plantations so that he could understand the politics and economics of the business. He came back and launched the brand with Kirban in 2004, and today, VitaCoco is being retailed across 17,000 outlets in the US. Interestingly, PepsiCo has a 50 per cent stake in ONE, the challenger that's way behind VitaCoco, which controls 62 per cent of the market share - the beverage behemoth clearly sees big bucks in the humble coconut water.

The beauty of these coconut drinks - and this should give the more enterprising ones among us a business model to follow - is that they come in different flavours (VitaCoco's founders insist that they were inspired by Brangelina and Tomkat!). So you have coconut water with peach and mango, acai and pomegranate, tangerine, and pineapple. The next time I pick up green coconuts from the guy who has a mound of them piled up next to a crematorium (where else but at the last stop of the dead should one look for a life-giving liquid!) close to our office, I am going to chill it and have the coconut water with mango or litchi juice.

The success of coconut water in the Western Hemisphere also points to a larger trend of people in the developed world moving away from carbonated to 'natural' drinks. Says Julian Mellentin, author of the study quoted by BeverageDaily.com ('Coconut Water 2012: Innovation and Natural Health Benefits Drive a New Category), ""In our industry we are all concerned because of pressure from consumers to deliver the foods and beverages that are as natural as possible.""

And since coconut water - sourced from green coconuts aged six months or less - was high in potassium, naturally sweet and low in calories, it fitted the bill, Mellentin informed the website. He also pointed out that coconut water can be stored for long periods and packaged without ""altering its naturalness"", thanks to Tetra Pak's ""aseptic packaging innovations"".

Our number-crunching researcher assures us that coconut water is not just another fad because the ""the number one trend in the food industry worldwide is naturality"". Then he gets his facts a little wrong. ""I find it hard to imagine this ever becoming a mass product because we live in a world of niches,"" Mellentin says. Nice words, but coconut water is one of the oldest mass beverages known to our species. Let's just make it sexy.

World's cheapest michelin star

Does this look like a Michelin three-star restaurant? Well, it is. Does this look like a Michelin three-star restaurant? Well, it is.

Does a Michelin three-star restaurant mandatorily need to be a white-tablecloth temple of elevated gastronomy? The world may think so, but the culinary world's Oscars don't only go to stiff upper-lip restaurants with hyper-inventive chefs and high investments in dcor.

In Hong Kong, the Michelin inspectors, anonymous and working in complete secrecy, just awarded a three-star rating to a dim sum restaurant that you'd miss if you were in a hurry. Tucked away in Kowloon's crowded Mongkok district, Tim Ho Wan has the distinction of being one of the cheapest Michelin-star restaurants in the world, and in the three-star category, it is in the pricey company of Caprice and Lung Kung Heen, both at the Four Seasons hotel, and the Joel Robuchon in Macau.

It was a Lung Kung Heen chef who opened Tim Ho Wan because he wanted to serve quality dim sum at the cheapest prices (the Hong Kong dollar equivalent of Rs50-200 a basket) and there isn't a moment when the restaurant doesn't have a serpentine queue of waiting guests outside. A friend who visited the restaurant last month said you'd be better off taking a thriller along with you if you intend to drop by at Tim Ho Wan. With an average wait of three hours, you could easily count on finishing Grisham's or Baldacci's latest before your turn finally comes.

Erin de Santiagio, who writes The Art of Backpacking blog, offers a helpful tip. Reach the restaurant, which is in a workingclass district crowded with highrise apartment blocks spilling over with matchbox-like flats, at least half an hour before opening time. ""The shop is not easy to spot, but ? look for everyone else lined up at what seems to be a tiny storefront,"" writes de Santiago. ""It's not always easy to get the hostess's attention, but be sure you secure a number right away or you might find yourself behind 20 other parties within five minutes."" Here's a poor man's El Bulli and the world just seems to be loving it.

Wine lovers happy with milder kick

Bordeaux's elite may not approve of the young who want less alcohol in wines. Bordeaux's elite may not approve of the young who want less alcohol in wines.

Wine may not remain the same anymore if producers start listening to the market more than they have been. A survey conducted for German wine trade fair ProWein and reported by Decanter.com shows that consumers in four countries across three continents - the US, UK, Germany and China - favour a lower alcohol content. That's one sentiment we, the nation of super strong beer, may find blasphemous, but the world seems to be heading the other way.

The ideal wine, according to 1,000 random consumers surveyed by Wine Intelligence, should have less than 12 per cent of alcohol. Surprisingly, young people, especially women, are the most vocal about their preference for wines with lower alcohol levels - in China, an overwhelming majority of the respondents rooted for an alcohol level in the range of 5.5 to 8 per cent. At present, the levels range from 10.5 to 14.5 per cent.

The survey comes at a time when alcohol levels, especially in wines from warmer countries such as Australia and Chile, are rising worryingly. The upper limit of the alcohol percentage has touched 15.5 per cent - experts blame it on global warming - and some suspicious critics even insist in private that it has gone up to 16.5 per cent, but producers are not announcing it on their labels yet.

Why's everybody getting so worked up about alcohol levels? Wine is meant to be drunk with food. Higher alcohol levels play havoc on taste buds, so wine producers all over keep them within the established range. But the industry is now looking for validation to bring the levels down to single digits so as to get tax breaks and more women consumers. Being an old-school wine lover, I just hope better sense prevails over the industry.","['michelin', 'world', 'coconut', 'levels', 'cool', 'water', 'drink', 'wine', 'cent', 'threestar', 'alcohol', 'restaurant']","When you see them the next time, treat them with a little more respect, for coconut water is the newest fashionable health drink in the West.
