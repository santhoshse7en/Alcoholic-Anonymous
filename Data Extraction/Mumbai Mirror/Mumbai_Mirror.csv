The organisation runs its national head office from a Byculla municipal school, which BMC wants back as part of its drive to reclaim its classrooms., the international organisation devoted to help problem drinkers kick the bottle, has been asked by BMC to vacate the municipal school premises in Byculla, which has been the organisation’s India head office for the last 21 years.The eviction notice, issued a few days ago, is part of the BMC drive to reclaim its classrooms from NGOs and similar organisations who are not involved in ‘education-related’ activities.In June, a similar notice had been issued to theInstitute for Deaf & Deaf blind, which occupies 11 classrooms in another municipal school in Byculla, following which the institute officials said they will take up the matter with the chief minister if forced to move out (Helen Keller Inst, BMC at loggerheads over premises, Mumbai Mirror, September 17). The institute has been running its school in its current location for the last 36 years.As per the BMC statistics, 2,000 of its classrooms across the city have been rented out to NGOs and charitable trusts on a nominal monthly rent, but several of these have been running non-educational programmes.While the Helen Keller institute said the disability of their students was so complex that regular classroom dynamics don’t work, the Alcoholics Anonymous, which operates from a municipal English medium school on Meghraj Sethi Marg, said its work was nothing less than imparting education.Arun S from Alcoholics Anonymous’ Mumbai unit said, “We have already made a representation to BMC, requesting them to consider ours as a special case. We are not using the premises for commercial gains; rather, we are helping people from across strata.”The institute,over three classrooms, operates its all-India helpline, and also publishes its pamphlets in more than 15 Indian languages.Additional Municipal Commissioner Mohan Adtani, however, promised the Alcoholics Anonymous a “positive response”. He said, “They have sent us a representation and their activities are not profit-driven. I will give them apositive response,” he said.The BMC top brass, however, feared the concessions granted to one organisation will be used against the civic body by others. Manoj Kotak, chairman, Education Committee (BMC), said the civic body will have to stick to its premises-only-for-education policy. “The guidelines are clear: all non-education institutes will have to move out of municipal schools. Organisations such as Alcoholics Anonymous, who aredoing a great service to the society, should be provided alternative accommodation by the government,” he said.Sources in the civic body said the BMC classrooms will no longer be given on rent. “Municipal schools will be run by private organisations or trusts in partnership with BMC, which will retain control of its schools,” the source said.","['alcoholic', 'vacate', 'classrooms', 'premises', 'municipal', 'schools', 'bmc', 'school', 'alcoholics', 'organisations', 'anonymous', '21', 'asked', 'yrs', 'organisation', 'civic']","I will give them apositive response,” he said.The BMC top brass, however, feared the concessions granted to one organisation will be used against the civic body by others.

Alcoholic deaddiction awareness programme held at Vashi police stn,"Vashi:  A group of members of Alcoholic Anonymous (A A), a fellowship of men and women working for those who are willing to get rid of alcohol addiction, descen",['George Mendonca'],None,"motivating talk: The AA members explained the primary purpose of staying sober and helping other alcoholics to achieve sobriety

Vashi: A group of members of Alcoholic Anonymous (A A), a fellowship of men and women working for those who are willing to get rid of alcohol addiction, descended on Vashi police station on October 8 with the intention of spreading awareness among the policemen about the ill-effects of alcoholism.



The members of AA aimed at achieving their primary purpose of staying sober and helping other alcoholics to achieve sobriety. They propagated their recovery programme to help the policemen to quit alcoholism, in case any of them was addicted to alcohol, and also help others in the society to quit alcohol, thereby helping them to lead a stress-free life which otherwise, due to alcoholism, adversely affects their family members.



A member of Alcoholics Anonymous, on conditions of anonymity said, """"The AA recovery programme to help quit alcohol, we believe, will work for almost anyone who has a desire to stop alcohol consumption . It may work even for those who feel that they are prodded in the direction of AA. We have seen some alcoholics stumble for a while before getting on with the programme, but with repeated efforts, they have regained their senses and walked in the right path.""""



SPI Raosaheb Sardesai of Vashi police station informed, """"We had conducted the training workshop for the police staff to help them understand the adverse effects of alcoholism. Hence, to achieve our goal we had invited the experienced members of the AA, who addressed the gathering of around 70 police staff comprising PIs, PSIs, APIs and the constabulary.



The members propagated about the activities of the AA and the efforts taken by them to help alcoholics get rid of their addiction. The policemen like other individuals are not regular drinkers but still it is a necessity to instil within them a sense of responsibility towards the society.



The awareness amongst the policemen will but naturally help them in tackling situations wherein they face people addicted to alcohol thereby enabling them to convince the alcoholics by explain them the methods of quitting alcohol, albeit gradually.""""



Another member of AA, on conditions of anonymity emphasized, """"Early, in our association with AA, we heard about the 'Twelve Steps; of recovery from alcoholism, we learned that these steps represented an attempt by the first members to record their own progress from uncontrolled drinking to sobriety.



We discovered that a key factor in this progress seemed to be humility, coupled with reliance on a power which is greater than ourselves. While some members preferred to call this power as 'God', we were told that this was purely a matter of interpretation. As we have grown in AA, our concept of a greater power has usually become more mature. But, it has always been our personal concept; no one has forced it upon us.”



“Experience shows that alcoholics should, and can, learn to pace themselves. 'Live and Let live' is one of the slogans of AA. When we first turned to AA, many of us had a number of serious problems involving money, family, job and our own personalities.



However, we soon discovered that our immediate central problem was alcohol. Once we had that problem under control, we were able to make successful approaches to the other problems. Solutions to these problems have not always come easily, but we have been able to cope with them far more effectively when we were sober than we were able to do during our drinking days.""""

Heartbreak cure: Why you need to celebrate the present,Love is like a drug — romantic love causes changes in brain chemistry that are remarkably similar to the use of substances like cocaine and heroin;,[],None,"Love is like a drug — romantic love causes changes in brain chemistry that are remarkably similar to the use of substances like cocaine and heroin; and the experience of unrequited love is similar to the experience of an alcoholic or drug addict in withdrawal, unable to live without the substance, even while they know that the substance will harm them.Alcoholics Anonymous is a group that helps people get over alcohol addiction, and some of their guiding principles may also be applied to heartbreak. The most effective of the AA strategies, when it comes to heartbreak, is to have faith in a higher power, to know that something greater than yourself will restore you to peace and happiness.It’s very hard for us to have faith in ourselves. To have faith that things will turn out all right. To know that, one day, even this difficult and painful time will recede. When we face a life situation that we don’t have solutions for, we can start feeling helpless and alone. We feel this way because, consciously and logically, we do not feel strong and complete.But the truth that you must remember, even in moments of pain and despair, is that you have a vast untapped potential and a deep wisdom that is guiding your conscious life. This internal compass and wisdom will lead you out of pain and into fulfilment, if you allow it to. Surrendering to a higher power is a way of tapping into the vast reservoirs of subconscious wisdom and strength.The times we feel weak and have lost faith in ourselves is when we most need faith. Ironically, faith in something larger than ourselves helps us unlock our own inner healing powers. And it doesn’t matter if you are an atheist or a believer – even the existence of God is not required for you to experience the benefits of surrender and faith.To know that you will be okay and that you will find happiness again is such a powerful belief that you will at once and immediately feel a sense of relief.Once you surrender to a higher power in this manner, you will find it easier to let go of the past and to live in the moment‘The secret of health for both body and mind is not to mourn for the past, not worry about the future, but to live the present moment wisely and earnestly.’ — The BuddhaI can hear you say, ‘How can I find peace in the present, when the present is full of pain?’ Yes, it isn’t easy to live in the present moment, when you are hurting. But consider your pain and the thoughts associated with your pain and you will find that your pain is not from the present, but from memories of the past and from worries about the future.If you forget about the past and let go of the worries of your future you will immediately begin to feel peace. This is easier said than done, of course, but I urge you to try because as you increase your depth of awareness of the present moment you will start feeling more and more peaceful.You can begin staying in the present moment and letting go of the past and the future by first focusing on your breath. Make sure that you breathe easily and steadily throughout the day. When we are tense, and stressed, we hold our breath. Our breathing becomes shallow and this pattern of breathing sends a signal to the brain that we are under stress. The stress then further tightens the breathing and so on, in a vicious cycle.Even though you may not be able to still the thoughts in your mind and your worries, you can break through the cycle of stress and find peace by first stilling your body.When you still and relax your body and relax your breathing, your mind will get the message that you are feeling safe and secure.Practise meditation in this manner once or twice a day to start increasing your awareness of the present moment. It will help you let go of the past, celebrate the future and enjoy the present moment.","['future', 'celebrate', 'know', 'pain', 'need', 'peace', 'live', 'past', 'present', 'feel', 'heartbreak', 'faith', 'moment', 'cure']","To know that, one day, even this difficult and painful time will recede.

opens up on her battle with the bottle and how she reclaimed herself.Today is the 68th day and Pooja Bhatt hasn’t touched a drop ofsince she pulled the plug on December 24. She’s gone through Christmas and New Year and even brought in her 45th birthday on February 24 without a drink. Talking about her battle with the bottle openly in the public space is part of her catharsis.“I want to bust the stigma attached to alcoholism in our country. Women particularly are discouraged from seeking help because it’s a matter of shame for the family. We don’t share our pain or frailties, we cover our weaknesses and it becomes a cancer,” says Pooja, admitting that in her case it was a chat with her father that led to this decision.On December 21,messaged her from Delhi and they got talking about the state of the country, about leaders who in their eagerness to imprint their footsteps in the sands of time create absolute mayhem. As he was ringing off, he told her, “I love you kid.” She responded, “I love you too pops. As far as I’m concerned, there is nothing else worth loving in the world.” He replied, “If you love me then love yourself because I live in you.”Her father had never alluded to her problem, but the text urging her to love herself, struck a chord. Pooja promised him that “from this moment I’m going to be the best ‘me’ I’m capable of being” and after putting down the phone wondered if going out with someone and polishing off a bottle of whisky was loving herself. The answer was a resounding ‘no’.On Christmas Day, the Bandra girl who is Christian by faith, put her phone on silent and sat in her apartment with her four cats listening to the strains of “Silent Night” wafting in from somebody’s home. “I ate dinner and went to bed at 11.40 pm, sober. At midnight I heard the bells of the four churches ring and felt rejuvenated,” she exults.She took off for a holiday to Lahore, to Delhi, to several places. And while in the past she’d spent evenings alone, with a bottle of wine, in some café, watching the world go by, this time, she stayed away from the wine. Not just through Christmas but even the drunken revelry of New Year.The public pressure escalated as her birthday neared. She toyed with the idea of taking one drink. “But then I asked myself if I needed it, and if I did, why stop with one glass? Why not drink the whole bottle of champagne because as somebody said, ‘One drink is had with the enemy.’ I called my friends to my farm, we swam at 2 am, we did many fun things, but I didn’t drink,” she smiles.She’d smoked her first cigarette at 23 and has never done cocaine. But she was drinking by the time she was 16. Growing up in an Anglo-Indian environment, it was normal for wine to be passed around the table and beer opened on Sunday. Even in the film industry there were people drinking copiously.“Alcohol is comforting, it colours your evening. It’s a socially accepted narcotic even at business lunches and in the boardroom. Also, living in a fast-paced city, being in a high-stress profession, it becomes a reason to celebrate and cope with failure. Your film is a hit, you bathe in champagne, it flops, a single malt lessens the pain,” she avers.Two years ago, Pooja ended her marriage. Though the end of a 10-year relationship is akin to death, she did not give herself time to mourn. She moved on, and the world said cheers to her spirit and energy. “Before I knew it, it’s a whirlwind of hedonism,” sighs Pooja who can drink every man in the room under the table thanks to her Scottish genes and her father’s genes. “I was born to a man who has never done anything in half measures and I inherited that. So when I drank, I drank copiously. Your appetite increases even as the alcohol does terrible things to your body, clutters your mind and colours your judgement of the people you’re hanging out with.”One evening, in the middle of another mindless conversation, she asked herself if she’d be sitting there without the alcohol. The answer was another ‘No’ and it was time for some soul searching!She’d seen what alcohol did to her father, how it had killed her parents’ marriage. She’d been in relationship with an alcoholic and got her into the news. She’d lost a friend at 40 to alcohol and had a drink to mourn her. But all this while, it was someone else’s problem, she was in control. This time, as her father had urged, she looked into the mirror unflinchingly and acknowledged she had a problem too.“I was 45 and if I wanted to give myself 10 years of living, I had to quit now before I drank myself to the grave. I had to reclaim the sharper, brighter me which had got watered down,” says Pooja.She was in Delhi recently sharing the stage withwho admitted he’d been a shy kid and drinking had made it easier for him to talk to a girl. Pooja’s never been shy or short on confidence. For her drinking was a way of deflecting reality till she became a victim of what she calls mindless drinking.“Luckily, I pulled the plug before it became impossible for me to stop. I’m in the pink of health except for the weight I put on because I’m now a stressful producer. But being the daughter of an alcoholic makes you four times more susceptible to becoming one,” she says.She didn’t need to go to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as she had strong support systems in her dad and her Cabaret director Kaustav (). Years ago, Mahesh Bhatt had picked up his younger daughter, Shaheen and the child had moved her head away. That day he quit drinking and never went back even though as you see in the climax of Daddy, one night after returning from the shoot and pouringa drink, he was tempted to take one too after everyone had left and Pooja was asleep. He asked himself who’d know and realised that he could lie to the world but not himself. He would know! “I didn’t think that the girl who’d counselled her father in Daddy would one day council herself,” Pooja says poignantly.Kaustav quit drinking two years ago because if anything went wrong on the Cabaret sets, he didn’t want anyone to blame it on his drinking. “No one thought he could stay 24 hours without alcohol but he proved them wrong. “For me these two are shining examples, who understand without me telling them anything,” she says, but agrees for many others, institutions like AA are necessary. “There are many who want you to fail. Strangers are more supportive than some of your own because your battle makes them realise that they have failed,” she points out.Today, Pooja herself has no problem being around anyone who drinks. She has a fully stocked bar at home and even pours out drinks for friends. “If I can’t be around alcohol and resist it, it means I’m not in control. Each day strengthens my resolve as I realise I have more hours to a day now. Even when I drank till 4 am, I’d be at work at 10 am but I was burning myself out. Today, I feel lighter with the excess water gone. All the drama alcohol brings is eliminated from your life,” she says.Her biggest victory was waking up to the news of her baby sisterwinning the. “I messaged Alia saying normally this would have been an excuse for me to crack open a case of champagne first thing in the morning. But this time I celebrated by not drinking,” Pooja signs off.","['pooja', 'quit', 'grave', 'id', 'drank', 'drinking', 'bottle', 'love', 'world', 'day', 'alcohol', 'father', 'bhatt', 'im', 'drink', 'didnt']","She’s gone through Christmas and New Year and even brought in her 45th birthday on February 24 without a drink.

When life’s on the rocks,"Over twenty-six million Indians drink more alcohol than they should. Are you one of them? If so here’s why you need to slow down, and how to do it.",[],None,"TWELVE STEPS TO RECOVERY AS PRESENTED BY ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS

ByOver twenty-six million Indians drink more alcohol than they should. Are you one of them? If so here’s why you need to slow down, and how to do it.According to the WHO, across the world, alcoholism claims more lives per year than even AIDS, which takes it right to the top of the ‘killer diseases’ list. Manmohan Taneja, Co-Founder of Wilson Smith Recovery Services (WSRS) which offers programmes to facilitate recovery from addictions, says, “According to a 2014 WHO report, which relied on a 2010 survey, approximately 30 per cent of the Indian population drinks alcohol; out of this 11 per cent are drinking at a harmful level, and approximately 2 per cent or 26.5 million people indulge in binge drinking.”This may come as no surprise, given the proliferation of watering holes in this city, but what should raise a red flag is Taneja’s revelation: less than 10 per cent of problem drinkers seek treatment.Roy V Tellis, who co-founded WSRS with Taneja is an alcohol abuse counsellor and a certified ’12-step consultant.’ He’s also a recovered alcoholic. Now 56, Tellis shares his experience: “Having grown up in a family where parties and drinking were regular weekend affairs, I had access to alcohol very early in life. As kids, I remember we were given a glass of shandy in all parties. That was the kind of exposure I was used to. One day, my friends and I went out trekking with two bottles of alcohol. We were just 16 years old. The booze made me feel terrific, and I didn’t want to stop at that, so I went and brought some rum from a bootlegger. I don’t even remember how I reached home that day. Later, I came to understand that I had had an alcoholic black out then.”Roy adds, “Eventually, in college, I went from being a weekend drinker to a daily drinker. I couldn’t concentrate on anything.”Consultant psychotherapist Azhar Hakim says, “Ideally, a person should not drink more than three pegs in one sitting, twice a week. Cross this limit and you’re asking for health trouble.”Psychiatrist, Dr Tanay Maiti adds, “If one wants to stop being an alcoholic, then he/she should not target complete abstinence from day one, or get frustrated if he/she relapses after a short period of abstinence. Sudden stoppage after a habit of regular drinking can cause various kinds of discomfort, even lead to medical emergencies, and this may drive you back to your previous pattern of heavy drinking.” Maiti highlights that alcoholics must remember the acronym ‘HALT.’ “It stands for Hunger, Anger, Loneliness, and Tiredness — these may work as triggers and lead to excessive consumption of alcohol, regular consumption or/and relapses.”Hakim says, “Alcoholism begins with alcohol dependence, i.e. when the person cannot do without alcohol. And one is so preoccupied with alcohol that one is constantly looking for occasions to consume it. As it progresses, one will continue to drink alcohol regardless of the financial or physical problems it causes.”He adds, “Alcohol dependency is experienced by 15 per cent of drinkers. It is incurable, but a fully treatable disease. Alcoholism is like diabetes. It is chronic and progressive. If left untreated, the problem worsens.”The reason that alcoholism remains unchecked is that, like with all addictions, addicts refuse to admit there’s a problem. Recovered alcoholic Raj Singh (name changed), a Colaba-based CA, says, “At the age of 38, I refused to listen to anybody who said that I had a drinking problem. I was irresponsible and completely negligent towards my family’s welfare. I would gulp down eight to nine bottles of beer in an hour. I must have known this was crazy because I remember lying to people about the amount I was drinking. I used to sit around in bars from 5pm to four am. There were times when I did not go to work for months. I used to be violent at home, hit my wife and break things. Yet, for all of that, at the time, I couldn’t see that I had a problem. One day, a friend dragged me to an AA meeting, and that’s when my journey of recovery began.”Chronic alcohol abuse poses many threats to one’s health and general wellbeing. Long term overconsumption causes brain cells to die and this in turn may lead to mental disorders. It can, of course, also cause liver damage and cirrhosis and inflammation of the pancreas or pancreatitis. Additionally, psychiatrist, Dr Maiti says, “Other than the body, the psyche also gets affected, leading to depression, poor anger management, impulsive disorders, and in many cases, it leads to an addiction to other substances.”Besides, the family of an alcoholic suffers through his or her addiction. Forty-seven-year-old advertising professional and resident of Parel, Shilpanjali Mehta (name changed to maintain anonymity), wife of a recovered alcoholic recalls, “I tried to control the situation, but it was crazy. I used to have to pick him up from bars late at night, and with a small baby at home, things were difficult. He used to land up drunk at every family occasion, be it a celebration or a funeral prayer — it was a huge social embarrassment, and aside from affecting his health, it was very distressing for all of us.”Shilpanjali shares, “I got in touch with Al-Anon (a group for family members of alcoholics). They taught me about the disease, and the three Cs: You have not caused it, you cannot control it, and you cannot cure it. That means you are totally powerless over another person’s drinking. Understanding this releases you from the burden of guilt and self-pity. After multiple failed attempts and disappointments whenever I tried to get him to seek help from different sources, I started focussing on myself instead, on my career and my daughter’s upbringing. I realised that I need to build my own life and be responsible for my own happiness.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1.

I am a 34-year-old health professional, but presently a home-maker. My husband drinks moderately on weekends. I’ve tried to persuade him to stop but he brushes me off saying that it is a common way of easing stress and that he is in control.



He warns that my nagging, crying and fighting on this issue will do more harm than good. He thinks I am overreacting, but I’m afraid. My husband is not a very strong-willed person and I fear he will eventually get addicted. Many men start off as casual drinkers but end up drinking heavily and ruining their lives. What should I do? I don’t want his habit to spoil our otherwise happy family life.

Dear Ms Prohibition,



OMG, talk about self-fulfilling prophesies. I suggest you relax. Preferably, with a nice glass of red, or maybe even something stronger. Husbands are not usually right, but your Mr-ji is perfectly within his rights to unwind this way. By your own admission, he’s drinking only moderately, and only on weekends — and I’d bring even this estimation down a peg or two because in your paranoid state, you have probably exaggerated it.



To me, he doesn’t sound one bit like he’s on the road to destruction, or even the nearest centre of Alcoholics Anonymous. He’s the one who has made the more sober analysis, namely, that if you continue “nagging, crying and fighting on this issue” you will certainly drive him there.



Just listen to yourself. You sound like a prissy, pursed-lip, holier-than-thou harridan. A domineering wife who thinks only she knows what’s good for her family, and everyone else is a weakling who would be ruined if you weren’t there to ‘save’ him. Why on earth should he get ‘addicted’? For your information, I know many more casual drinkers who haven’t turned into alcoholic wrecks.



Let me be brutally honest. Your problem is that you were once a busy professional doing an important job for society, but now that you are a homemaker, you need to justify your existence (take out your frustrations) by nagging everybody else. Here’s something to shake you out of your alcoholism-induced delusions: if you don’t reform, your ‘happy marital life’ will indeed get ‘spoilt’, and the fault will most definitely not be your husband’s.

Last year, I started a tradition. Instead of entreating the Almighty to ask for limitless bounty, I would seek to make anominal difference to the people for whom Eid meant seeing others wear new clothes.Irang one of the NGOs working extensively with the rag-picking community and the result was that we provided Rs 500 each to 246 kids from the back lanes of– to come with us to Spencer’s store in the posh Quest mall. A quick recap: the kids were ushered through a side-gate to ‘protect’ the mall’s brand and prevent the wellheeled from getting a culture shock; the kids watched the mall insides with the same open-mouthed wonder as kids when taken on a walking tour through Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory; they grabbed every large chocolate slab they could find, loaded cans of Red Bull (!), filled their mall basket to the brim until it made more sense to push the basket (the word they used was ‘theyl’) to the counter for billing.This year’s venture was less of the same and a bit of the different. We selected to venture into the hutments of Narkeldanga; the encroachment (few notches below a slum) sits beside a canal; the canal is the public loo. Last year, when the residents eked out some 200 sq ft for collective benefit, a reputed realtor put cash down to build them their first public toilet in living memory.When we proposed to bring children from this anonymous Kolkata pocket to Quest mall, the debate floor was divided: ‘What’s the use of exposing impressionable children to a world, however fleeting, that will only enhance their feeling of hopeless inadequacy?’ was one argument; the other was ‘at least such an initiative will make these children happier so Eid will not be about other children but about themselves for achange’.The distillation of this argument panned out in two ways: we proceeded with getting 82 children from. Sweet kids. Innocent kids. Kids you want to do something for so that they may graduate to a better life except that within 15 minutes of the origination of this noble sentiment, one was calling the broker to place an order to buy 5,000 shares of some probable multi-bagger and conveniently forgotten.It is the second part of the morning that was different. A number of young Muslim girls of the city are educated in Urdu-medium schools. There is a growing feeling that these kids would be better-equipped if they could be educated in an English-medium equivalent. Interestingly, even for those of the lower middle-class minority who do study in an English-medium school, the challenge of language absorption endures. One, even as schools may be English-medium, the lingua franca continues to be the good old vernacular. Two, even if the kids do get to Englishmedium, they generally limit their conversation to elementary exchanges like ‘What is your name?’ and ‘Where do you live?’ Thirdly, language skills are built on the edifice of active residential conversation, which in the case of first-generation studentship, is unthinkable.So what we (my generous funders like Bhowanipore Educational Society College, NK Realtors and private purses) decided was: why not give each of these students Rs 500 with which to buy any English book or stationery of their choice? The school we selected was Samaritan Help Mission in), backed by a school-dropout social entrepreneur who started with four students in an alcoholic neighbourhood 13 years ago and now oversees the school-based education of more than 4,000 students. We selected students from class nine and ten and within a couple of hours, the students had selected a range of books to take home – possibly the first ever time in their lives that they had exercised their independent decision to buy anything worth Rs 500 (most of their families would figure in the sub-Rs 10,000 monthly income bracket).Will this exercise of buying young children books for Eid have a payback? I wish I had an answer. However, let’s hope it has a similar story to the one of a lower middle-class boy from Ahmedabad, who was once taken to see the port of Kandla; when he grew up, that vision drew him to create a port that is arguably the most efficient in this country; even better, he manages or owns 11 ports in India today.

There is that lovely line about a dil being chhota with chhota si asha, which ends with ‘chaand taaron ko chhonay ki asha’.I guess that’s why a Rs 500 reading incentive to a kid could well make for the most powerful VC gamble one has ever made.","['buy', 'students', 'rs', 'englishmedium', 'children', '500', 'eid', 'selected', 'mall', 'limit', 'kids', 'sky']","There is a growing feeling that these kids would be better-equipped if they could be educated in an English-medium equivalent.

On Thursday, city police stations received a form which everyone has to fill. The form mentions that the information will be confidential and that the “informer’s” identity will not be revealed.The form has seven questions that every policeman/woman has to fill up about someone in the same police station: 1) Does s/he consume alcohol? Is s/he an alcoholic? 2) Is the person a womaniser, or behaves badly with people outside the police station? 3) Does the person gamble? 4) Does the person abuse drugs? 5) Is the person involved in extortion? 6) Does the person take frequent leaves or is s/he frequently absent? 7) Is the person short-tempered or shows violent streaks?In recent weeks, the force has lurched from one controversy to the other - the shocker of Marine Drive Constable Dharmaraj Kalokhe’s involvement in the statewide meow-meow drug racket, allegations of rape against officers, and the knockout punch of ASI Dilip Shirke shooting dead his boss, Senior Inspector Vilas Joshi, before killing himself.Confirming the exercise, a senior police officer said: “Getting information about the character of people in the police is routine. But this year the CP has given specific framework to the forms and the information to be collected.”Speaking on condition of anonymity, a police inspector welcomed the move. “Any police person who behaves irresponsibly will think twice now,” the officer said.“This practice will help maintain transparency. But at the same time, there is a fear that this practice will be misused. Some clean officer may be targeted through such anonymous information. How would our seniors verify such information after collecting it on a citywide level? This may give rise to blackmail within the force. There are always some disputes going on.

Shital wasn’t deterred; she scored 92 per cent in SSC, 90 per cent in HSC, 94 per cent in PCB (Physics, Chemistry and Biology) and got the 509th rank in the Maharashtra CET. Most would have been elated; Shital was defeated. She secured a seat in B J Medical College (Pune) but there was no money to sustain it. Foundation For Excellence heard and arranged for a scholarship. Shital secured 68 per cent in the first year and now intends to specialise in gynaecology and work in rural India.Rajarshi Bhowmik was born to a struggling family in a coastal Bengal town. He studied by a kerosene lamp. His real challenge began when he completed his school examination. A larger educational investment was now needed: books, coaching and study materials for the entrance examinations. The school principal connected him to the FFE facilitator who arranged the funding. Relieved, Bhowmik secured a spot in the top 10 of the 12th standard board exam and a rank within the top 2 per cent in the engineering entrance exam. Now came an even bigger challenge: the college fees of around Rs 3 lakh. FFE offered to pay the interest of an education loan for four years. The result: Rajarshi completed his B Tech and is employed in an MNC.Akshaya Kumar G came from a family dependent on the meagre income of an elderly, priestly father. Since he attended a school within the Gurukul education system, he had to be mainstreamed for class ten. He appeared for his SSC exams privately, secured 95.5 per cent, joined the PUC (science stream), struggled with English but reported 94.6 per cent in HSC. Since he hoped to pursue engineering, he was selected as an FFE scholar and went on to top the university.He was part of the college team that entered the final of Robozest (IIT Mumbai event). He seeks to pursue his post-graduation from IISC Bangalore in Astrophysics and possibly one day work for ISRO.Yogita’s father passed away in November 2014 and the family was reduced to a meal a day. From the sixth standard, a government scholarship accounted for Yogita’s education and hostel.Yogita ranked 946 in her CET exam, which obtained her a place at Shri Vasantrao Naik Government Medical College (Yavatmal). Same problem: no funds. FFE stepped in. Yogita now intends to specialise in gynaecology and plans to complete her post-graduation from AIIMS. Chitralekha Gurumayum from Imphal comes from a family where her alcoholic father is an occasional mason and chauffeur, while her mother stitches handmade traditional blankets. Chitralekha was exempt from paying fees through school as she was always ranked first.When she was confused about her educational direction, her school principal helped; she passed HSC with 74.9 per cent. She secured the 202nd rank in her first medical entrance exam; she re-attempted it and came 34th. The game was virtually over – there were no family jewels to sustain her journey through Jawaharlal Institute of Medical Sciences (Imphal). FFE stepped in as the white knight. Chitralekha cleared her first year MBBS with ranked 34th and second year MBBS with a rank of 39(64 per cent).Venkataraghavan Hegde walked 5 kilometres to take the bus to school, and occasionally missed it when an overflowing river swallowed the bridge. He secured a decent ranking in the state CET exam (1315), which got him an engineering seat in the prestigious BMS College of Engineering. The important question: ‘How does one pay for the fees and accommodation?’ FFE said don’t worry: it funded the college tuition fees and text books and gave him guidance as well. Today, Venkataraghavan is a graduate engineer working with Delphi Automotive Systems.So what is Foundation For Excellence? An NGO started by venture capitalists Dr Prabhu Goel and Poonam Goel focused on life transformation of academically brilliant (but financially needy) Indian students, by awarding meritcum-means scholarships.

Vaibhav Kamble has rescued several children from poverty by giving them shelter and an education.For hundreds of children forced into begging and manual labour, Vaibhav Kamble is a veritable saviour. By ensuring that they are enrolled in city schools and are provided food and shelter, the 22-year-old has rescued scores of street children — a majority of them young girls — from the shackles of poverty.Born in Basarge, Kolhapur, Kamble was always passionate about education. An admirer and follower of Dr BR Ambedkar, he always believed that education was the most effective instrument for social change. “When I came to the city in 2009, I saw several children, sometimes as young as three-four years, begging at traffic signals and in public places. Some people religiously dropped in a coin or two, but I wanted to do something that would reach out to them in a more significant way. I realised that if we give them education, an entire new generation will be able to earn a living. They’d be free from the cycle of poverty,” says Kamble.Kamble remembers that the first case he came across was that of seven-year-old Salma (name changed). He found her on the footpath opposite Ruia College, Matunga. Salma’s father was an alcoholic and her mother had sent her to beg on the streets. She was weak and her skin was patchy because she lacked haemoglobin. Vaibhav called 1098, the ChildLine helpline number, from where she was allotted a shelter in Sion. His work, however, did not end there.Salma’s family did not have any of the documents required to get her admitted into school. Vaibhav’s Facebook page, which he uses to primarily find logistical and financial support, proved priceless. He urged people to help with basic legal formalities like affidavits. He was flooded with calls from lawyers all over the city and in the next few days, Salma found her name on the rolls of a school. She now says Kamble is her ‘best friend’. “We usually have a lot of trouble in completing formalities for street kids after they are rescued. But once we give the responsibility to Vaibhav, he takes it from there,” says Manisha Parle, a social worker.The Salvation Army orphanage in Sion is home to several girls who met Kamble on some footpath or the other. They are now studying in nearby schools and they no longer have to worry about where their next meal will come from. Another such case is that of Sunanda (name changed). Sunanda’s mother set herself on fire in 2011. She had had enough of the domestic violence that was being meted out by her husband. Sunanda, who was 14 then, witnessed the tragedy but could not do anything. Sunanda testified against her father in court. He was immediately arrested, but was out on bail in a few months. “Once he was out, he drank all day and harassed me. One day, while returning home from school, I saw Vaibhav talking to some street children. I told him my story. Within a week, I was out of that hell and amongst people who loved me and cared for me,” she says. Sunanda is now pursuing her BA from a reputed city college. She aspires to become an IPS officer. “Vaibhav just told me one thing. You won’t have to sacrifice on anything from now. And he has been true to his word.”Kamble lives in the Babasaheb Ambedkar Worli boys’ hostel and travels to his Lonavala college twice a week. Besides pursuing a BE in mechanical engineering there, he has also signed up for a distance learning programme offered by the Yashwantrao Chavan University. He soon hopes to have earned a BA in Political Science. Kamble is trying hard to juggle his studies with a small-time recycling business that he is launching and his work for the city’s poor and needy.In the last three years, the young altruist has created a vast network of lawyers, doctors, social workers and government servants. They all help him pro bono. Kamble has even expanded his reach by providing higher education to several girls. “Most orphanages keep these girls till they are 18, but after they leave, most of them end up working as domestic help or in small factories. They discontinue their education. This is why I am concentrating on enrolling them into colleges and providing them with a hostel where they can also earn a stipend,” he says.Giving street childen food, shelter and educationVaibhav Kambleransforming the life of several impoverished young girls by sending them to school and collegesVaibhav realises the power of human agency when changing one’s immediate sphere.

Sunil Satpute: Their only alternative,,[],None,",

S

Often abandoned by their families, many children with special needs have found hope in Sunil Satpute.At a three-room set up in Prabhat Colony Municipal School in Santacruz east, Sunil Satpute runs Gharkul (or, ‘home’), where he educates children with autism, Down’s syndrome, learning difficulties and other special needs, who are often neglected by their families. The 45-year-old, who also teaches several poor students, has been involved in similar educational activities since 1998.Born into a poor family, Satpute grew up in the slums of Sion Koliwada with his alcoholic father and mother who worked as a domestic help. Realising the power of education early on, he taught students from his locality to keep them away from antisocial activities. “Where we lived, bread and butter were more important than anything else. Most kids resorted to wrong means to earn an extra buck. I brought them all together and started teaching them,” says Satpute. However, he realised that several others with special needs could not cope up with their studies. “Most of them dropped out of schools. For most parents, they were a burden as they had to spend on their treatment and had to be with them all the time. Several of them were abandoned by their families,” he adds. Satpute wanted to start an organisation to provide special education to such children.He started working for Baljeevan trust, an NGO that rescues street kids, while simultaneously hunting for a place for his organisation. After a month long search, he zeroed in on a municipal school in Vile Parle. Around 30 children from nearby localities started coming to the school and he appointed two special educators and a caretaker to look after them. But authorities asked them to vacate the premise, explaining that the building is to undergo redevelopment. They were promised a place in Kurla, which meant a loss of students because of the longer distance.After months of searching for an alternate space and submitting proposals to several authorities, he was allotted a few rooms at the Prabhat Colony Municipal School in Santacruz. They managed to get several students from nearby localities. As the students attend school from 10.30 am to 4.30 pm, their parents are free to work during those hours. They, however, do not have to pay a penny for their child’s education. “Our goal was to create a curriculum that was alternate yet not too different from the mainstream one. Every special child has some capacities, just like he has several weaknesses. If someone can paint, we train them in painting, but if a child is coping with reading and writing, we ensure that he is taught just like any other school-going child of his age.” Unlike other schools, there are no exams. “Each special educator monitors the performance of a child depending on his/her disability,” he adds.Students are taught everything from English to mathematics along with several vocational skills like painting, crafts, quilling and so on by four special educators who are paid meagre salaries sponsored by donations. “We don’t have a big fund. All our donors are middle-class servicemen who chip in either with money or with physical help.”Satpute still juggles his day job at a city-based NGO and his work at Gharkul and this means working for more than 12 hours on some days. The biggest challenge is tackling parents’ apathetic attitude towards these students, he says. “Once they send them to school, they do not even come to ask about the child’s performance. They often make inquiries about full-time shelter homes so that the child does not come home at all,” says Satpute.He now plans to start a residential shelter for the children, so that they can be monitored around the clock. Although the organisation still struggles to find funds, Sunil remains optimistic. “The moment I enter the school, these smiling faces come running towards me and talk to me in their own language — some say a ‘hi’ while the others just stare. What can be more fulfilling?” he smiles.Gharkul, a school for children with special needsSunil SatputeEducating students with special needs for free, on the sole strength of donationsSunil knows the pain of special kids like no one does.

Among 1957’s biggest Hindi hits was, a triptych of tales about a house and its succession of tenants, which inaugurated the career ofLaakh laakh makaan, aur inmein rehne wale karoron insaan. In karoron insaanon ke sukh-dukh, hansne-rone ke maun-darshak -- yehi makaan (Lakh of houses, and crores of people who live in them. And the mute witnesses to these people's joys and sorrows –these very houses),” runs's voiceover as the camera pans across a cityscape, finally settling on one such makaan as the setting of this particular story.What I just described is the opening sequence of Musafir, a triptych of tales about three different families, connected only by the house they rent in succession. The third film in my series of columns on the top Hindi hits of 1957, Musafir was the tenth highest box office grosser that year, and has several points of interest about it. For one, it was the directorial debut of Hrishikesh Mukherjee, who had come to Bombay from Calcutta with Bimal Roy in 1950. Mukherjee had worked as Roy’s editor at New Theatres for five years, and in making the journey to Bombay at 27, he joined a group of young Bengali men with various kinds of cinematic ambitions. These included the actor Nazir Husain, writer Nabendu Ghosh, assistant director Asit Sen and dialogue writer Pal Mahendra. The second bit of trivia that makes Musafir interesting also relates to a young Bengali man — Mukherjee shares writing credits on the film’s script with the filmmaker Ritwik Ghatak.From where we stand now, the raw, powerful Ghatak of Subarnarekha orand the warm, gentle Mukherjee of situational comedies like Chupke Chupke may seem to represent two unbridgeable poles of the Indian cinematic universe. But in the late 50s the world was young, the lines between the artistic worlds of Calcutta and Bombay, and those of 'art' and 'entertainment' were still permeable. Thus the man who would become one of the cinematic trinity of grandly ambitious Bangla high art wasn't so distant from the man who would come to stand for the mild-mannered, middle class Hindi comedy of manners. The year after Musafir, 1958, two films released – one was Bimal Roy's marvellous Nehruvian-era ghost story,, which was written by Ghatak, and the other was Ghatak's own directorial venture, Ajantrik, in which it is another inanimate object – a car rather than a house – that is at the centre of the human stories Ghatak chooses to tell.Musafir itself combines Mukherjee's lightness of touch and prodigious talent for characterisation with Ghatak's flair for the melancholy and for the recurring motif. Most of the film unfolds, as was Mukherjee's wont, within the four walls of a house. But Musafir also contains the sense of a streetscape – we view the house first from the chai shop window, and the chatty tea-delivery-boy (Mohan Choti) appears in each narrative. In fact it is he, along with the genially repetitive landlord (David), the gossipy Munni ki Ma, and the friendly neighbourhood drunk Pagla Babu, who stitches the film's three parts into a sociological urban whole.Like's, which I wrote about two weeks ago, Mukherjee's first film deals with what was then a relatively new urban world, increasingly unmoored from feudal certitudes. The tenants who are anonymous until they aren't, family units whose legitimacy cannot be vouched for by foreknowledge, village elders or caste networks; nosy neighbours (like Munni ki Ma) who make it their business to establish the traditional 'rightness' of those who have moved into the area. In the first segment here, for instance, Suchitra Sen plays a new bride who yearns to be accepted by her in-laws despite her runaway marriage. The possibility of a nuclear family unit is one she rejects instinctively as inferior to the real thing.Mukherjee's interest in these new populations, free-floating in space but not quite ready to give up on their connections to community, family, tradition – remained a persistent theme in his films in later years. Tenants, landlords and the negotiation of neighbourhood rules are central to his comedy Biwi Aur Makaaan (1965), and also to the Jaya Bhaduri-Amitabh Bachchan starrer Mili (1975). Both Mili and Bawarchi also begin by visually laying out the neighbourhood, and then using a voiceover to zero in on the one home whose internal dynamics we are to have the privilege of witnessing.In Musafir, these dynamics seem to involve older men who, despite their 'good' intentions towards their families, are such sticklers for discipline/rules/rationality/tradition that they end up tyrannising wives and daughters, as well as any non-conformist younger men – the young man who marries without parental permission in the first story; the jobless Bhanu (a very youthful) in the middle segment, who can't stop playing the fool; or the heart-stopping Dilip Kumar as the violin-playing tragic alcoholic of the last segment (clearly inspired by O'Henry's 'The Last Leaf'). The lawyer brother of Usha Kiron, or Nazir Hussain as the irascible father with money trouble, and Suchitra Sen's father-in-law in the first segment are all men determined to to be merciless, grown-up patriarchs who must be humoured like children – and one can see in their caricaturish excess the roots of Utpal Dutt's character in Golmaal, or Om Prakash's Jijaji in Chupke Chupke. Musafir has some rough edges, and its tonal shifts from tragic to comic are not always successful. But it is an interesting film, if only for the many ways in which it foreshadows Mukherjee's future filmmaking career.","['film', 'homing', 'zooming', 'mukherjee', 'men', 'man', 'house', 'segment', 'films', 'young', 'mukherjees', 'musafir']","In karoron insaanon ke sukh-dukh, hansne-rone ke maun-darshak -- yehi makaan (Lakh of houses, and crores of people who live in them.
