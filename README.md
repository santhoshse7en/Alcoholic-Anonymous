# AlcoholicsAnonymous
- **Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is a global organization that was created, and is designed, to help former alcoholics through the process of learning to live their lives without the crutch of alcohol abuse.** 

- People who attend AA groups have made the decision to stop drinking and stay sober. Some of them join voluntarily; some attend as a continuation of their therapy.

- The other members of the group act as a support network, explains the American Journal of Public Health; they share success stories and honest accounts of setbacks, and use this emotional connectedness to inspire and encourage each other to keep going




## Alcoholics Anonymous is based on the 12 Steps
- Devised by its co-founder, Bill W., and based on the Christian beliefs he adopted as part of his sobriety.
- The 12 Steps are presented as a set of principles to guide former alcoholics on how to tackle the problems caused by their     addiction, how to make amends, and how to continue in their new lives as recovering drinkers. 
- The 12 Steps have proven iconic enough to be adapted by other self-help and addiction recovery groups, such as Gamblers        Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and Food Addicts in Recovery Anonymous, with the precise terms adapted to represent the        focus of the particular group. 


**The main aim of this project is to collect the information about awareness of AA in socitety and ways of AA solving the alcoholics problems.**
