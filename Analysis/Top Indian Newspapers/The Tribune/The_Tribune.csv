When she hits the bottle...,"Today, globally India shows the third largest increase in alcohol consumption in the last 20 years, up by 52 per cent. In 2012-13, the India Centre for Alcohol Studies (INCAS), a government research body, had predicted that alcohol consumption among women in the country would grow by 25 per cent in the next five years, higher by 15 per cent than the overall rise projected for the industry.",Tribune News Service,2016-07-31T00:58:00,"Linda ChhakchhuakToday, globally India shows the third largest increase in alcohol consumption in the last 20 years, up by 52 per cent. In 2012-13, the India Centre for Alcohol Studies (INCAS), a government research body, had predicted that alcohol consumption among women in the country would grow by 25 per cent in the next five years, higher by 15 per cent than the overall rise projected for the industry.Among the key reasons for this exponential rise in alcohol consumption, particularly among urban upwardly-mobile women, is the misplaced notion that they are ‘cool’ and ‘liberated’ if they raise a glass. Whereas having the freedom to choose and breaking gender stereotypes are vital for women's agency, this need not necessarily extend to asserting the ‘right to consume alcohol’. Of course, predictably, liquor manufacturers have latched on to this popular perception of 'liberated womanhood' and they are not just launching but also aggressively marketing new variants of alcoholic drinks targeted specifically at women. Indeed, leading brands are not hesitant to concede that their markets have expanded, thanks largely to this growing trend.Unfortunately, the ‘good times’ only lead to not-so-good-times for many who start off as recreational drinkers but soon become habitual. As is the case with addicts around the world, according to Alcoholic Anonymous India (AA-I), women here, too, find it difficult to say, “I am an alcoholic”, words, they believe, are the first step towards dealing with this addiction. In the north-eastern states, while it's easy for women to buy a drink, it's difficult for them to find a de-addiction facility that caters to their needs. In fact, gender bias rears its ugly head even here, as families are ready to go all out to help a son but are only too eager to ignore, deny or hide a daughter's problem.Recently, in a first for the Northeast region, the AA-I set up the Shillong Women's Fellowship, a platform for women who want to give up their addiction. At the launch of this critical service, Father Joseph H. Pereira, founder of Kripa Foundation, which offers rehabilitation to those affected by chemical dependency and HIV/AIDS, emphasised that “alcoholism is a disease and not a sin to be condemned”. He observed, “There are so many people who are afflicted with this disease and many have succumbed to it. Yet, the shame and negative stereotype associated with this condition doesn't allow people to come forward and deal with their addiction.”For women battling chemical dependency, a term often used interchangeably with substance abuse, even admitting to addition is difficult, let alone confronting it. Sister Rose Paite, a member of the General Service Board (GSB) of the AA-I, who has worked on the issue of sobriety for women for the last 13-odd years, explained that the situation in the north-east states is dire because women, and the society at large, is in a state of denial.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });Calling alcoholism a “hidden epidemic”, she fervently wished their efforts would soon question this dangerous status quo. Sister Paite is the convenor of the movement for helping Women in Recovery for Sobriety that hopes to encourage the creation of similar AA-I fellowships for women across the region.Both Father Pereira and Sister Paite strongly recommended the need for a “holistic method” like the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) method, which is based on a 12-step programme, as there was no “chemical solution for chemical dependency”. “The medical model has totally failed. There is nothing more powerful than the AA method,” they asserted, adding that if one has gained sobriety, they must not keep it to themselves but share the experience with others.As it is, the odds are stacked against women, be it socially or medically. Said Sister Paite, “Parents would like to spend much on sons, but when it comes to daughters, they say they do not have money.” Explaining the medical dimension, Dr Harsh Udawat, Chairman of the GSB of the AA-I, iterated that alcohol consumption was more risky for women than for men. “Alcoholism is a progressive disease and there is no real cure for it. As a doctor, I have seen innumerable cases and can definitely validate the fact that there is nothing really very good about alcohol. Naturally, it does come down to one's personal choice and there cannot be any denying that, but exercising caution is crucial when it comes to drinking. In any case, the death rate among alcohol dependent women is 50 per cent, which is 100 per cent higher than in men,” said the doctor, who is also a gastroenterologist in Jaipur, Rajasthan.Besides the experts, there were quite a few women from Mizoram and Delhi, who came forward to talk about their experiences and share their ideas on motivating those battling alcoholism to seek support. Stating that the programmes under AA “had come to their rescue”, they wanted many more to understand the value of the sisterhood they shared being part of an AA group. “As an alcoholic, I felt that I was on the verge of dying,” related one, while another spoke of how she had “decided to put my best foot forward to help others”. The woman, who led the group from Delhi, explained that there were 30 women associated with them, “all sober and recovering”, ready to talk about their experiences with their “sisters”. For women from Mizoram and Meghalaya present at the meeting, it was “cathartic” to come face-to-face with those who had benefited from the AA approach and hear them speak openly about addiction on a public platform.“Clearly, without sustained medical and psychological intervention to deal with their problem, women alcoholics are setting themselves for a downfall,” cautioned Sister Paite. This disturbing reality motivated her to initiate the Shillong Women's Fellowship so that it's easier for women to come forward and seek a helping hand. “I want the women from the Northeast to fearlessly work on their sobriety issues,” she urged. Under the Shillong Women's Fellowship, recovery meetings are slated to be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays at the Don Bosco Youth Centre in the city. While there is no fee for AA membership, an absolute must is the yearning to change.Women are natural fighters — they can speak up against discrimination, they can stand up to problems. If they are leading movements to bring about and enforce prohibition in several states, overcoming alcoholism cannot be insurmountable for them.  — WFS","['bottle', 'alcoholic', 'come', 'alcoholism', 'aa', 'aai', 'hits', 'cent', 'women', 'alcohol', 'sister', 'paite']","Indeed, leading brands are not hesitant to concede that their markets have expanded, thanks largely to this growing trend.

"Poor me, don’t pour that drink...","AAP MP Bhagwant Mann put alcohol right, left, front and centre in our drawing rooms, chilled with guilt and drowned with apologies with a hangover of repentance.",,2019-02-04T06:37:00,"Lakhinder Jit Singh VohraAAP MP Bhagwant Mann put alcohol right, left, front and centre in our drawing rooms, chilled with guilt and drowned with apologies with a hangover of repentance. Better late than never. Alcoholism is a progressive disease of the mind, an allergy of the body, and a spiritual malady. The first step in overcoming an alcohol addiction is admitting being powerless and that life has become unmanageable. I am a recovered alcoholic. My date of sobriety, as it is called in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), is the last time I took a drink — November 24, 2013. I distinctly remember the time and place where I was, when I consciously put the glass down saying enough is enough. My body simply could not take the two or three double Patiala pegs of Double Black Johnnie Walker on the rocks every night. I am sure that if I had not stopped, like many others we hear or know, I would have been dead by now. A big part of alcoholism, which we often lose sight of, is the people in your life, who aid and abet — the enablers. It could be a coterie of so-called well-wishers, the freely flowing booze at political fundraisers, weddings, bootleg brands behind closed doors, one-for-the-road Army brats. It could also be family members who turn a blind eye and never acknowledge a drinking problem, or show tough love so the alcoholic gets help. Mann, in a brave act, had showed up with his mother and announced that he was giving up. But for many alcoholics, the cause of drinking is deep-rooted in family and early childhood trauma, lack of an emotional connection with parents or siblings, or family pressures that justify an escape to solitude and drinking. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });However, faith in the Almighty; seeking professional help, such as a mental health professional; staying away from booze-filled occasions; clearing out the liquor cabinet… is more tough than half-admitting at a political rally that you are promising to quit, even though you claim you do not have a drinking problem. In India, you have to be half-apologetic and give many explanations to near and dear ones why you stopped drinking or how bad the drinking problem had gotten! You are made to feel guilty even for quitting! What most people do not realise is that an alcoholic has to say no to the first drink because like most other normal drinkers, once he takes the first drink, he is powerless to say ‘no’. For him, one is too many and one thousand is never enough. Hope Mann was not trying to draw sympathy in the election season. Like they say in recovery — poor me, pour me a drink.","['family', 'alcoholic', 'drink', 'professional', 'tough', 'say', 'pour', 'powerless', 'problem', 'stopped', 'poor', 'dont', 'drinking']","My date of sobriety, as it is called in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), is the last time I took a drink — November 24, 2013.

"Kicking the bottle, one day at a time",The picturesque resort along the gushing waters of the Beas at Manali provided the perfect backfor a cocktail party.,Pradeep Sharma,2015-06-21T01:57:00,"The picturesque resort along the gushing waters of the Beas at Manali provided the perfect backdrop for a cocktail party. However, over 200 cheerful former alcoholics, a majority of them anytime drinkers, along with their families preferred to say “cheers” over a glass of juice or a cup of coffee. The occasion was the 12th Convention of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), that was organised recently.The motley crowd of recovering alcoholics comprised businessmen, private sector executives, government servants and women professionals. Their transformation had not been sudden. It was the result of a programme of recovery of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), a worldwide fellowship of recovering alcoholics which boasts of a membership of over 30 lakh with over 30,000 sober alcoholics in India alone.Kicking off one session after another with the prayer “God grant us serenity to accept the things we cannot change, courage to change the things we can and wisdom to know the difference”, various speakers narrated heart-rending stories and how they escaped from the deadly dragnet of alcoholism “one day at a time” through AA’s 12-step recovery programme.“I have turned to fertiliser from garbage,” a participant, sober for nearly 20 years, summed up the transformation. Through AA, he came to realise that he was not a bad person but a sick person suffering from an incurable progressive disease called alcoholism. However, the disease can be arrested “one day at a time” by attending meetings where the AA members share experiences, strength and hope.

Women are as much affected as men though women alcoholics face a far graver social stigma. Never once since my late teens did I think I would be able to remain sober for over a month. And, here I am, sober for a few years now. I am a miracle.Alcohol was once the solution for all my problems. It solved my insecurities, loneliness, anger, sense of not being good enough, being the odd one out everywhere… a few drinks would make all these and so many other thoughts and feelings just disappear. I drank alone and I drank like no one else I knew. Slowly, long before I knew it, alcohol ceased to be my friend and my solution. I was drinking throughout the day and wishing death would come in one blow and end the suffering that life had become. It took me a decade to admit that maybe drinking and my life, being the hell it was, were interlinked!I couldn’t ask anyone for help. That’s for the weak, I felt. I still don’t remember how I got to hear of AA. God alone knows how, one morning at around 3 am, I got online and noted down a helpline number of AA, got drunk and went to sleep. By now, I had no regular job, stayed with my parents and was unable to even make a sandwich for myself or my son, who was six years old then. I could not taste food, coordinate colours and my movements were awkward. With no choice at all, I declared to myself that I would go and check the drunkards who went to a meeting with a name like AA.By evening, I was on my knees begging my father to go into the rooms to see whether it was good enough for me. You see, I was dying slowly physically. Mentally and emotionally, I was already dead, but with every bit I had in me, I wanted to know whether the meeting of AA members was up to the mark! I was a woman. I was scared. But unbeknown to me, I had been blessed by the gift of desperation. My father scouted the room for me and came back with the Big Book (basic text of AA). The next day, I went to my first meeting and have never looked back. Being a woman doesn’t stop me from heading to the meeting anywhere now. The members of AA accept me and care for me like my family.I do not want to ever live that hell I lived in. Going to the meetings, getting a sponsor (to do the AA programme) and learning to practice the AA principles in my day-to-day life is responsible for every good thing in my life today. Once I stopped drinking, I had my broken life to deal with and nothing to hide behind. I had to find another way to live. That new design of living came to me via my sponsor through the Big Book. I do not want to remember my last drink but I do remember that unbearable pain. I don’t have that today. I don’t wake up and have that big black hole in my soul anymore. Now, I lead a good, full life. Alcoholism brought me to my knees because it led me to the gates of hell and yet I couldn’t stop drinking. Today I can. I have some tools, steps and some friends who actually like me. This programme gives me the opportunity to be the woman that God wants me to be.(The writer, whose identity remains anonymous going by AA’s policy, has been sober for a few years now)","['bottle', 'stop', 'sober', 'aa', 'help', 'life', 'drinking', 'alcoholics', 'alcohol', 'getting', 'day', 'kicking']","However, the disease can be arrested “one day at a time” by attending meetings where the AA members share experiences, strength and hope.

Phelps dodges jail in drunk driving case,"BALTIMORE (USA): Olympic swimming great Michael Phelps looked to the future, including the Rio Olympics in 2016, after he dodged a stint in prison for drunk driving.",Tribune News Service,2014-12-20T14:01:00,"Baltimore (USA), December 20Olympic swimming great Michael Phelps looked to the future, including the Rio Olympics in 2016, after he dodged a stint in prison for drunk driving.The most decorated Olympian of all time struck a remorseful tone when he appeared in a Baltimore courtroom where he acknowledged the DUI charge against him.As his defense lawyer pleaded for leniency, it emerged that the 29-year-old is attending Alcoholics Anonymous sessions after completing 45 days of intensive rehab at the Meadows addiction treatment center in Arizona.“During my 45-day programme, I was able to find out a lot about myself that I never knew,” Phelps, in a dark suit and heavy-rimmed glasses, told Judge Nathan Braverman yesterday.He added: “I’m looking at a much brighter future than I have had in the past.”(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });Phelps—still under a six-month suspension from competitive swimming—could have landed in prison for driving too fast after a few too many at Baltimore’s chic Horseshoe casino in the early hours of September 30.But Braverman opted to heed a state prosecutor’s recommended penalty—a one-year suspended sentence, plus 18 months of supervised probation, during which Phelps must abstain totally from alcohol.Phelps will be free to go outside the United States to train and compete, the judge said, but wherever he is he must stick firmly to his alcohol addiction treatment.“It sounds like you know what you need to do,” Braverman told Phelps, adding that he hoped the case would in time become “a footnote to a legendary career.”      Phelps was arrested for driving under the influence once before, when he was 19, in rural Maryland. His traffic record also included a 2006 speeding rap.Friday’s outcome clears the way for Phelps—whose 22 Olympic medals include 18 golds—to resume his return to top-notch competitive swimming.Due to the six-month suspension imposed by USA Swimming in the days after his arrest, Phelps will not be taking part in the 2015 world swimming championships in Russia, his attorney Steven Allen told the court.However, Phelps “is in the process of training for the upcoming Olympics” in Rio de Janeiro, said the lawyer, who gave no further details.Police pulled over Phelps in a white Range Rover SUV after he was clocked doing 84 miles (135 kilometers) per hour in a 45 mph zone in Baltimore’s undersea Fort McHenry Tunnel.After the arresting officer whiffed alcohol in the vehicle, Phelps underwent a breathalyzer test that found a blood alcohol level of 0.14 percent—well above the Maryland legal limit of 0.08 percent.Within hours, as news of his arrest got out, Phelps went on Twitter to acknowledge his error and express regrets to his fans—but gave no hint of any alcohol issues.His appearance in Maryland District Court—minus the beard he sported in a cheerful Thanksgiving family photo on Instagram—was a celebrity moment in a morning when Braverman was otherwise shoveling through dozens of routine traffic cases.Phelps said nothing as he arrived with his mother Debbie, his two sisters and former Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis, a local hero and close friend of the six-foot-four (1.93-meter-tall) swimmer.Allen took pains to stress Phelps’ involvement with youth groups, saying his client understood he was a role model and that he wanted his misfortune to stand as a lesson to others to beware the dangers of drink.Leaving the courthouse, after paying $57.50 in court fees, Phelps told reporters that the past three months had been among the hardest in his life.“I am happy to be moving forward,” he said, as a chauffeured black SUV waited for him and a member of his entourage waved off a couple of autograph-seekers.“I’ll continue to grow from this and continue on my path of recovery,” he added.“These couple of years are going to be very challenging.I’m very pleased and happy that I have the great support that I have around me.” AFP","['jail', 'driving', 'phelps', 'told', 'maryland', 'alcohol', 'suv', 'baltimore', 'dodges', 'braverman', 'case', 'usa', 'traffic', 'drunk', 'swimming']","Baltimore (USA), December 20Olympic swimming great Michael Phelps looked to the future, including the Rio Olympics in 2016, after he dodged a stint in prison for drunk driving.

IAF faces HC ire for confining corporal to psychiatric ward for alcohol dependency,"NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force (IAF) faced the ire of the Delhi High Court on Thursday for confining one of its non-commissioned officers, a corporal, to a psychiatric ward for over two months, because he was an alcoholic and suffered from mental disorders.",Tribune News Service,2018-07-12T21:45:00,"New Delhi, July 12 The Indian Air Force (IAF) faced the ire of the Delhi High Court on Thursday for confining one of its non-commissioned officers, a corporal, to a psychiatric ward for over two months, because he was an alcoholic and suffered from mental disorders.A Bench of justices S Muralidhar and Vinod Goel questioned the rationale behind the IAF’s decision, asking how it determined on a daily basis that the corporal still “craved for alcohol”.The court also said the newly-enacted Mental Health Act made it clear that a person could not be forced to undergo treatment without his consent, adding that the IAF “cannot ignore the laws of the country”.Terming the conduct of the IAF “irresponsible”, the Bench wondered how many of such cases there might be, which were yet to be highlighted.“How were you determining on a daily basis that his craving for alcohol had not gone down?

Under the new Mental Health Act, you cannot force him to undergo treatment without his consent. Then how are you pumping him full of drugs? We do not know who should be proceeded against,” the Bench said.It added that the IAF needed to be reminded not to interfere with a person’s liberty as “short of chaining him up, everything else was done here” and directed that the corporal be produced in court tomorrow.According to the IAF, represented by the Centre’s standing counsel, Ripudaman Singh Bhardwaj, the action against the corporal was taken on a complaint from his wife that he turned violent after consuming alcohol.Bhardwaj said the corporal, Kriyad Yogesh Bhankhariya, had alcohol dependency issues for which he was initially treated in the psychiatric ward of the Army Base Hospital here and thereafter, in June, he was shifted to the medical centre at the Tughlakabad Air Force Station.The court said if the non-commissioned officer (NCO) was an alcoholic, then the IAF ought to have sought the help of the “Alcoholics Anonymous” on how to deal with the matter as any psychiatric would confirm that confinement of a person was advisable only in extreme cases.“It is worrying, the manner in which you have approached the situation,” the Bench told the IAF.The court was hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by the 30-year-old corporal’s father, claiming that his son was being illegally confined at the Army Base Hospital. —PTI","['confining', 'court', 'corporal', 'iaf', 'ward', 'psychiatric', 'faces', 'consent', 'undergo', 'dependency', 'mental', 'bench', 'alcohol', 'force', 'ire', 'hc']","New Delhi, July 12The Indian Air Force (IAF) faced the ire of the Delhi High Court on Thursday for confining one of its non-commissioned officers, a corporal, to a psychiatric ward for over two months, because he was an alcoholic and suffered from mental disorders.

"Legalise drugs, get rid of addiction","TWO different news, apparently unrelated, made it to the newspapers a fortnight or so back. The first of these appeared, possibly, in The Tribune, with the headline  “81 lakh lesser tobacco consumers since 2010”.",Rajendra P Jindal,2017-08-07T00:19:00,"Rajendra P JindalTWO different news, apparently unrelated, made it to the newspapers a fortnight or so back. The first of these appeared, possibly, in The Tribune, with the headline  “81 lakh lesser tobacco consumers since 2010”. The other news item appeared the very next day, and was titled ""Punjab Inspector held for drug trafficking"" The same evening, it was prominently splashed on all television channels. It continued to be followed in the media for the next couple of days until it was drowned by similar news.An ordinary reader may be excused for not seeing any relation between these two. But let us take them one by one. It may be news to most readers that tobacco (nicotine) is a drug too, albeit a legal one, in all the senses of the word that “drug” conveys. Until a few years ago, rich and powerful tobacco companies in the US, most of the medical researchers and doctors (the latter too on the payroll of tobacco companies) refused to admit that tobacco is a drug. It was contended that it is, at worst, a habit-forming substance only. With the help of PET and MRI scans, it has been conclusively proved that nicotine creates the same biochemical and molecular effects in the brain as any other drug such as cocaine and heroin and many other activities such as a kiss, a hug or a word of praise. This effect is known as elevation of a neurotransmitter substance (a chemical which carries messages from one micro part of the brain to the other) called “Dopamine”. The surge in the level of Dopamine produces a feeling of pleasure, at least initially. This effect is not common to the same degree in everybody; probably it is modified by a genetic factor. Therefore, whereas some people can ""take it and leave it"", others become addicted. Smoking or chewing tobacco is as addictive as any other drug and as difficult to get rid of. It gives the same sense of pleasure and the physical ill-effects are much more than any other drug. No other drug causes fatal cancers, heart and chest problems and many serious ailments.The interesting question that arises is: how were 81 lakh people able to give it up without even a single one ever being arrested or put into jail? No amount of tobacco was confiscated and no police officer or politician was ever accused of dealing with tobacco. One reason is that unlike other drugs, tobacco was never prohibited. Secondly, it is the education by various means and at various fora about the ill-effects of tobacco that has worked the miracle. In school and college textbooks, on radio and television as well as cigarette advertisement boards and even cigarette packets, ill-effects of smoking are prominently displayed. Most people seem to know that smoking causes the cancer of the lungs, even if they know nothing else. Therefore, compared to many more than those who have given up smoking are those who want to and are trying to give up smoking.  (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });As far as the other news that a Punjab Police Sub-inspector was held for drug trafficking, nobody should have trouble believing that the episode is only the tip of the iceberg. A junior police officer cannot run a drug empire without the collusion of  colleagues and seniors. In the run-up to the Punjab Assembly elections, the chiefs of at least two of the political parties declared that they will totally abolish the drug menace from Punjab within a month of coming to power. The one who is now the Chief Minister, sotto voce, scaled the peak of rhetoric and ignorance when he declared that “the back of the drug trade has been broken”. As the subsequent events, including the news in discussion have revealed, the demon called drug trade is healthy and well, thank you. Are these leaders innocent, ignorant, naive or plain simpletons? The drug trade will persist as long as our approach to handling it remains archaic.For some unknown reason, in contrast to smoking and consumption of alcohol, consuming drugs has always been considered a character flaw, a criminal activity. The dopamine hypothesis has proved that drug addiction is a disorder of the brain no different from that caused by nicotine and alcohol. It is a mental illness of similar nature. The right place for a drug addict, therefore, is a hospital and not a prison and the way to deal with drugs is not to prohibit them but to legalise them just as it is in the case of tobacco and alcohol. Why are we so keen and insistent on prohibiting drugs and not tobacco and alcohol, while the latter two are more harmful? It obviously cannot be because we are a nation with knee-jerk puritanism. In that case, we would prohibit alcohol also. There are two reasons for the insistence on drug prohibition. The drug trade will exist as long as there is prohibition that generates exorbitant profits for the drug lords like our Sub-inspector and his seniors as well as politicians. Also, we inherently want to punish narco-trafficking, not eradicate it. However, the most novel reason for drug prohibition so far has been propounded by the American author Barbara Ehrenreich. She feels that we cling to prohibition for the same reason one clings to so many other self -destructive habits like nicotine, cocaine and heroin: because of the way it makes us feel — good and self righteous. If we surrender now, it will send the wrong message. Says she, “Legal drugs, even if heavily taxed and extensively regulated would no doubt be cheaper than illegal ones. This could mean more people sampling them out of curiosity. This danger has to be weighed against the insidious marketing dynamics of illegal drugs whose widely inflated prices compel the user to become a pusher and a recruiter of new users”. It is time to try a new approach to the drug problem. The people who want to use drugs know where to get them and no law has yet dissuaded people from using them. Legalise, regulate and tax drugs to the hilt. Take the money that would have gone towards preventive laws and spend it on education, healthcare and rehabilitation. A word about rehabilitation too. Dopamine-related research has shown that abstinence, if maintained, not only halts the physical and psychological damage wrought by drugs but also reverses it in large measure. A majority of the rehabilitation centres, mushrooming all over and uniformly lacking sufficient staff with enough expertise (psychiatrists and psychotherapists) and dedication (nurses and helpers), are worse than prisons. An addict needs long treatment, perhaps running into months. During this period, there are failures but their rate is no different from that for other chronic diseases. Nearly half the recovering addicts fail to maintain complete abstinence after a year, about the same proportion of patients with diabetes and hypertension who fail to comply with their medication regimens. Therefore, occasional relapse only means that more treatment is required, not that the addict be imprisoned. Alcoholic Anonymous and Narcotic Anonymous are the two organisations which probably have the highest cure rate because their members never refer to themselves as “cured”; they always call themselves “recovering addicts”. We could begin with a drug like marijuana and see how abolishing prohibition works. Then, we could move on to more drugs. Doesn't it sound like an idea that might catch on?The writer is a surgeon at the Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital, Faridkot","['drugs', 'tobacco', 'punjab', 'reason', 'nicotine', 'prohibition', 'drug', 'smoking', 'legalise', 'trade', 'alcohol', 'rid', 'addiction']","One reason is that unlike other drugs, tobacco was never prohibited.

Among other things, it had questioned the business interest of the Badals.He had added: “If a government employee cannot do any business in his or his family’s name, how all Badals are doing business of transport, cable TV, TV channel and sand mafia, restaurants and five-star hotels since the Badals’ have been elected by the people just to govern the state and not to earn from the state”.","['plea', 'cbi', 'transport', 'bus', 'turns', 'court', 'high', 'headed', 'state', 'case', 'probe', 'justice', 'orbit', 'hearing']","Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, December 3Just eight months after a 13-year-old girl died on being allegedly thrown off a bus owned by Orbit Aviation, the plea for a CBI probe into the matter today failed to find favour with the Punjab and Haryana High Court.

Experts struggle to fix Britain’s National Health Service cyber-hack,LONDON: Experts have been working round-the-clock to restore IT systems of Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) after a large-scale cyber-hack by an international criminal gang wreaked havoc around the country.,Tribune News Service,2017-05-13T15:09:00,"London, May 13 Experts have been working round-the-clock to restore IT systems of Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) after a large-scale cyber-hack by an international criminal gang wreaked havoc around the country.With nearly 45 NHS organisations from London to Scotland hit in the “ransomware” attack on Friday, patients of the state-funded countrywide service are facing days of chaos as appointments and surgeries have been cancelled.Ciaran Martin, who leads UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, said his team was doing everything in its power to get “vital services” back up and running.“We are very aware that attacks on critical services such as the NHS have a massive impact on individuals and their families, and we are doing everything in our power to help them restore these vital services,” he said.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });“It’s important to understand that cyber attacks can be different from other forms of crime in that their sometimes highly technical and anonymous nature means it can take some time to understand how it worked, who was behind it and what the impact is,” he told the BBC.Critically ill patients were being diverted to unaffected hospitals as computer systems failed in accident and emergency (A&E) units and doctors were locked out of test results, X- rays and patient records.NHS England said patients needing emergency treatment should go to Accidents & Emergency or access emergency services as they normally would.However, there have been some reports of ambulances being diverted from affected hospitals. Individual NHS trusts have asked registered patients not to attend unless it is urgent.London’s Barts Health NHS Trust, the largest trust in the UK, cancelled all outpatient appointments at its five hospitals on Saturday.The NHS has not been affected in Wales and Northern Ireland.The assault is part of an attack that has affected organisations in more than 70 countries, including the US, China, Russia and Spain, and disrupted power and telephone companies.Gangs are thought to have used tools stolen from US spies and dumped online by hackers linked to Russia.“This is not targeted at the NHS, it’s an international attack and a number of countries and organisations have been affected,” British Prime Minister Theresa May said yesterday.“The National Cyber Security Centre is working closely with NHS Digital to ensure they support the organisations concerned and that they protect patient safety. We are not aware of any evidence that patient data has been compromised,” she added.Ransomware programmes, which are sent by email and spread swiftly, can be bought on the dark web with sellers negotiating a percentage of the takings.“We will be advising NHS trusts to modernise their platforms,” UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd said.The malware used in the NHS attack is called WannaCry and attacks Windows operating systems.It encrypts files on a user’s computer, blocking them from view, before demanding money, via an on-screen message, to access them again.The demand is for a payment of $300 in virtual currency Bitcoin to unlock the files.The virus is usually covertly installed on to computers by hiding within emails containing links, which users are tricked into opening.A German ticket machine, a university laboratory in Italy and a number of Spanish firms - including telecoms giant Telefonica, power firm Iberdrola and utility provider Gas Natural - are among those hit by the outbreak.Portugal Telecom, delivery company FedEx, a Swedish local authority and Megafon, the second largest mobile phone network in Russia, also said they had been affected. — PTI","['patient', 'power', 'emergency', 'national', 'experts', 'health', 'affected', 'organisations', 'service', 'cyberhack', 'attack', 'services', 'patients', 'britains', 'struggle', 'fix', 'nhs']","London, May 13Experts have been working round-the-clock to restore IT systems of Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) after a large-scale cyber-hack by an international criminal gang wreaked havoc around the country.

Ronaldo gets Ballon d’Or,PARIS:Cristiano Ronaldo capped a remarkable year by claiming the fourth Ballon d’Or award after leading Portugal to an emotional European Championship title and Real Madrid to a record-extending Champions League crown in 2016.,Tribune News Service,2016-12-14T02:03:00,"PARIS, December 13Cristiano Ronaldo capped a remarkable year by claiming the fourth Ballon d’Or award after leading Portugal to an emotional European Championship title and Real Madrid to a record-extending Champions League crown in 2016.Ronaldo is one short of the record tally of five awards won by Barcelona’s Argentina forward Lionel Messi, who was second with the pair having taken the first two spots since 2011.“For me it’s a great honour to receive my fourth golden ball. The emotion is like for the first one, it’s a dream come true again. I never thought in my mind to win four times. I’m so happy,” said Ronaldo, who won the award in 2008, 2013 and 2014.“It’s probably the best year of my career collectively, with Real Madrid and Portugal. Real are used to winning titles while Portugal had never won a major title so this (Euro 2016) title is special. I don’t want to lack respect to the Champions League but the title with Portugal is a level above.” The Ballon d’Or, which merged with the FIFA World Player of the Year award from 2010-15 to create the FIFA Ballon d’Or, returned to France Football magazine this year. A total of 173 journalists voted but not national team coaches and captains who were also polled for the FIFA award.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });Cut aboveFrance and Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann, who lost to Ronaldo’s Portugal and Real in the Euro 2016 and Champions League finals respectively, took third place. Uruguay forward Luis Suarez was fourth and Brazil’s Neymar fifth, giving Barcelona three players in the top five.Ronaldo was a cut above the competition, though. He scored 51 goals in 54 games for club and country, albeit his lowest tally since 2008, claimed another Champions League winners’ medal and lifted the European Championship trophy. Ronaldo limped off midway through the first half of July’s Euro 2016 final, which Portugal won 1-0 after extra time against hosts France, but he hobbled back onto the pitch to celebrate his country’s first major soccer title. Six weeks earlier, after a fairly anonymous performance against local rivals Atletico in the Champions League final, he scored the decisive penalty in the shootout to hand Real their 11th European Cup. It was, therefore, hard to see past 31-year-old Ronaldo for the winner of the Ballon d’Or, even if the trophy is designed to reward individual performance rather than team results.Taxing questions spoil Ballon d’Or winRonaldo feels unable to celebrate his fourth Ballon d’Or award as much as his previous triumphs due to recent allegations of tax evasion. The European Investigative Collaborations (EIC) media consortium reported in early December that Ronaldo, and several other clients of soccer agency Gestifute, had used tax havens to handle tens of millions of euros in earnings. Gestifute denied the accusations last week. Ronaldo expressed his disappointment at the timing of the charges against him.“Of course it (allegations) has spoiled it a little bit. I would be lying if I said it hadn’t. I’m not a hypocrite,” he said. “I wasn’t pleased. The whole process in itself is hard and not only for me, but also for the people alongside me: my family, my son, all those who work with me. All that irritates me because I try to do things correctly, be transparent.”“I don’t have any reason to lie. What came out troubles me. Because it’s not true. The lie is troubling. I have done things correctly. There are a lot of innocent people in prison. And I feel a little bit like that. You know you have done nothing wrong, and they say you have done something reprehensible. No one likes that,” he added.Villarreal beat Atletico Madrid 3-0 Villarreal thumped Atletico Madrid 3-0 to vault into the fourth place in La Liga, dropping them to sixth. Adding to Atletico’s misery, midfielder Tiago and goalkeeper Jan Oblak left the match in the first half with injuries. The hosts took a 1-0 lead in the 28th minute when Manu Trigueros took advantage of an error by Tiago and beat Oblak with an angled shot. Oblak set up the home side’s second goal with a poor clearance that ended up at the feet of Jonathan Dos Santos, who hit the post once before putting away his own rebound to make it 2-0 in the 38th minute. Roberto Soriano settled the matter with a third goal for the hosts in the stoppage time.  Chelsea, Man City fined for fracasChelsea and Manchester City have been fined   $126,770 and 35,000 pounds, respectively, for failing to control their players during a Premier League encounter on Dec. 3. City striker Sergio Aguero’s reckless tackle on Chelsea defender David Luiz in stoppage time sparked a melee at the Etihad Stadium, with players and coaching staff from both teams involved in ugly scenes.

Redefining national security in complex new world,"In his avatar as a futurologist, Henry Kissinger in his thought-provoking book “World Order” draws a few conclusions relevant to India’s national security situation. Firstly, Kissinger notes that the world is spinning out of control with no designated caretaker.",Lt Gen SS Mehta (retd),2015-01-20T01:51:00,"In his avatar as a futurologist, Henry Kissinger in his thought-provoking book “World Order” draws a few conclusions relevant to India’s national security situation. Firstly, Kissinger notes that the world is spinning out of control with no designated caretaker. Secondly, he predicts that India will be the fulcrum of the 21st century world order because of its cultural cohesiveness. Thirdly, he notes with his patented asperity that foreign policy cannot be held hostage to domestic policies. Lastly, he notes the dichotomy that while economic structures are rapidly globalising, political structures remain enslaved to the Westphalian nation-state construct which is becoming increasingly irrelevant.An explanation is warranted here. The Westphalia Treaty came about in 1648 after incessant war drove the degutted participating states to sign up for what was formalised as ‘peace by exhaustion’. It also led to the creation of a politico-strategic structure identified as the nation-state. Over 350 years later, the global knowledge explosion underscored by the ubiquitous, all-pervasive social media and IT-driven technology platforms providing instant, affordable communications and convergence has raised serious questions about the continued relevance of the Westphalian model. Upgrading Westphalian model Alvin Toffler got this phenomenon right in his “Third Wave” analogy of the 1980s when he listed the everywhere (globalisation), nowhere (cyberspace), and out there (outer space) paradigm as the greatest turning point of the modern era. Driven by ‘techno-rebels’, this Third Wave has given a new meaning to national security by underscoring the increasing ease and anonymity of asymmetric threats to it by state and non-state actors and the resultant challenges now faced by the citizen. Thus, it is fair to say that national security will increasingly signify the security of the nation and its citizenry. This emerging space-cyberspace-instant communication continuum has totally diluted the historic idea of nation-states with national boundaries. Under the new dispensation, the ‘thing’ to be protected more than national borders is the individual of that country. Failure to undergo this transformation will render the idea of national security irrelevant if it isn’t configured as ‘all-embracing’. Thus, unless every citizen across gender, age, profession and religious persuasion feels to be an intrinsic part of the security ‘idea’ of that nation, part of its national security spectrum, the concept will become unstuck. Thus far, national security always meant two things: Scanning the security environment for likely threats and placing the military hardware needed to counter the perceived security threads. The soft side was either ignored, or glossed over as a sufficiently essential component of national security. Wisdom has now dawned that national security is actually the sum total of national defence, economic security and human security. All three add up to lend new meaning and substance to what comprises national security. As far as economic security is concerned, former Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor Dr Subir Gokarn pointed out that the Indian economy has displayed an inability to sustain high growth rates for long periods of time partly because it failed to deal with structural barriers on time. Left unattended, these barriers will emerge as serious existential threats to national security.  While national defence is well understood, the mediums of conflict have enhanced. Besides the traditional dimensions of land, water, underwater and air, we now have space and cyberspace. While earlier threats were stand-alone, cyberspace has now networked all threats, adding exponential value to each. This has forced us to understand and use cyberspace for national security. In the domain of human security, India faces six threats: Water, energy, health, education not resulting in employment, environment and technology. This combination of traditional and non-traditional threats coupled with the availability of affordable and enhanced mediums of anonymous asymmetric capabilities has complicated the security scenario. To deal with this synergistically, there is a need to design a unique architecture which concentrates on policy direction and monitors implementation. New security architecture On the architecture of the National Security Commission, we would be well advised not to go by the name. Whether it is the National Security Council, National Development Council or known by another name, it should have expertise to devise and articulate policy to suit the changed conditions and emerging challenges. Policy when clearly enunciated will provide the basis of a National Security Doctrine which, due to the rapidly changing environment, will always remain a work in progress. However, it will be the quality of available expertise and the design of the scaffolding, besides the wisdom to ‘add on’ or delete ‘redundancies’, that will remain critical.While placing due emphasis on the contribution of citizens to be partners in national security, it is axiomatic that we make policies that enable India to transit from a ‘labour arbitrage economy’ to a ‘knowledge arbitrage economy’. If we do not make this transition, we will remain the patronisingly labelled low-end labour force of the world: A condition which emphasises the insecurity and low self-esteem of citizens. Whether we upgrade ‘skilling’   using the ‘Make-in-India’ or ‘Made-for-India’ pathways or both, we will have to make this transition speedily empowered by well thought-out policies.   On the nuclear front, we are still using the grammar and lexicon of the Cold War. We have to devise our own grammar and lexicon. For instance, I am not convinced why we are not in a position to say that ‘threat of use is first use’. Sure, this usage is debate-worthy because it has complex dimensions, but is still the operating part of the new lexicon we should be using.  In the emerging understanding of statecraft, even seasoned campaigners like Kissinger have begun to see the wisdom of Kautilya’s “Arthashastra” formulations. He opines that the treatise represents practical statecraft, not philosophical constructs. Maybe it is time for us to reinterpret Kautilya’s teachings. Media and perception managementFinally, a word on the media — a key component of the national security architecture. While it has instant, mind-boggling information available to it, such access erodes perspectives and rapidly generates flawed perceptions. Often, and this happens cyclically on the TV media, while perception is at the goalpost, truth is still putting on its socks. That is where the print media remains compellingly relevant. This is because print provides a balanced perspective. Readers begin to understand the context of an occurrence that often results in a change of perceptions. However, the IT explosion has compressed time because even as the old story is being deciphered, another story or group of stories is breaking out. This reduces the importance of perception, leaving one notable causality: The truth.  The printed word, however, has the advantage of ease of access and archival recall. It isn’t a blip that comes and goes and will always be relevant. There is much more that goes into news gathering and its analysis and sifting of wheat from the chaff. The relevance of the print media cannot, therefore, be trivialised.  Concluded","['media', 'security', 'policy', 'remain', 'india', 'wisdom', 'national', 'world', 'threats', 'cyberspace', 'redefining', 'complex']","Thus, it is fair to say that national security will increasingly signify the security of the nation and its citizenry.

Right swipe for a like, left for a no, this one app has changed how people pursue their love interests and how. Touted to be the best platform to meet new people, it is trending big time and if you thought it’s for the young ones, please, its reach has spread far and wide.Aimed at an age group of 18 to 55+, you will find men and women using the same platform to fulfil varied purposes. Gurpreet, 20, made some new friends and met few of them too. A body buff that he is, his pictures kept attracting attention (super likes).

I am married. I had a real date with a woman from another city, and no, I don’t feel guilty.”For Manish Singla, a project manager with a tech firm, online dating works wonders as his job takes him to different places, meetings done, an evening free and here are options galore. “It’s always great to find new people and spent some time online or if lucky offline too, and Tinder truly assists in that.”However, the app works better in the metros than small cities like Chandigarh. For Nitin, a lawyer, it’s been frustrating exercise for all he could see was his own peer group. But things changed as he changed his location. “I was in Mumbai and it’s like an unending line of new faces. I did get a real date, but here in Chandigarh, I would rather hang out with my own friends.”For Prakriti, master psychology student, this app is lame for there are too many fake profiles. “Here, you just see the picture and swipe.

It’s fresh, convenient and happening. With time one evolves. Yes, boys would chase girls and vice versa in campuses and now they do the same in virtual space. At least this gives one a chance to familiarise with new people before you give them an entry in real life. Now, conservatives call Tinder names, level accusations that it encourages adultery. One, it’s an open platform, nobody is pushing you into it. You go if you like it, and play as per your principles. Friends, dates, partying, one night stands – you weigh, measure and take your call. Now, isn’t adultery as old as human race? If you want to do something, you would do it with or without Tinder.  I fail to understand the hue and cry made about it.—Vaibhav, chief officer, merchant navy No real action I feel people who go online dating do not have friends in real life. Since Tinder is trending big time, someone downloaded the app on my phone in the gym. No, it doesn’t work for me. I believe in making friends, not adding them. The platform brings you face to face with many, you like some, chat for a day or two and move on. Probably it works for younger generation which is looking for distractions, I am not. Married men looking for hook ups, married women looking for sex with anonymous people; it is a strange place to be in. No quality, only the numbers. May work for ‘quickly move on’ types.
