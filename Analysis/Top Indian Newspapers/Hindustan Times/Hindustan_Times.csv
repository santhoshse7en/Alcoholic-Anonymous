"Women alcoholics on the rise in Delhi, and across India","States like Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh have seen a rise in women drinkers. In some of these states, the proportion is higher than that of Delhi.",,2017-12-10T08:05Z,"When a sexagenarian wobbled up to the podium at the Frank Anthony Public School in Lajpat Nagar on Saturday, clad in a brown saree, a beige button-down cardigan and sporting a bindi, like every other Indian grandmother you meet in India, the words out of her mouth seemed misplaced.

“I am Rukmini*, and I am an alcoholic”.

Rukmini, who has been sober since May 1995, is one of the 30-35 women who are part of the all female Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) group, Shakti, in Delhi, and played a major role setting up the group.

According to members of Shakti, the Delhi group has the highest number of women as compared to similar groups of other states. This raises the question: have the number of women consuming alcohol in the national capital increased?

Female drinkers in Delhi

According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), in the decade between 2005-2006 and 2015-2016, the percentage of men and women who consumed alcohol in India and the percentage of the male population in Delhi who consumed alcohol has reduced. However, the percentage of women in Delhi who consumed alcohol has gone up from 0.4% of the female population in 2005-2006, to 0.7% in 2015-2016.

Other states like Chandigarh, Goa, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh have also seen a rise in women drinkers, and in some of these states the proportion is higher than that of Delhi.

So what brings out more women in Delhi to seek help? Is it because it is easier to get it in Delhi than in other states? And are these women from all walks of life?

Has the consumption of alcohol increased? States like Manipur, Goa and Kerala have seen a rise in women drinke rs. In some, proportion is higher than Delhi. Have you had trouble quitting drinking, even though you have planned to do so?

Have people around you raised concerns about your drinking habits?

Do you drink re gularly, on an almost daily basis?

Do you start your day with a drink, or start shaking if you don’t?

Have you developed a tolerance for liquor, and find yourself needing more alcohol to get drunk?

Has your drinking gotten you into trouble? Either with the law, at work, your friends, your relationships, or family?

Have you found yourself drinking more than you had initially planned to, because you find it hard to stop once you have started?

Have you skipped work or school because of drinking?

Do you drink until you blackout?

Have you felt the need to quit drinking, because you feel that your life would be better? If you have answered yes to more questions here than you feel comfortable with, it might be time to reflect on whetheryou have a problem or not.

Stigma around alcoholism

For 55-year-old Neha*, who has now been sober for 18 years, drinking was a “private” affair.

“I would get sloshed. But I would do it in the privacy of my home because I did not want to be shamed for it. I was the mother of three daughters, and I felt people would question my morals, values and character if I got drunk in public. Men were allowed to drink. It was an accreditation of their masculinity if they drank. It is not the same for women,” said Neha, who had started drinking to cope with an abusive marriage.

According to Dr Samir Parikh, a psychiatrist at the Fortis Hospital, there are strong stigmas attached to all mental health issues, and alcoholism is no different. However, what sets it apart is that comes with the added baggage of a gender bias against women.

“I would go as far as to say that around 90% of the people who admit they have a problem and seek help are men. Even if a woman is ready to admit she has a problem, she may not get the help she needs because she will be shamed for it,” said Dr Veena Kapoor, former president of the Indian Association of Private Psychiatry in Delhi, and a practising psychiatrist in south Delhi.

It seems that the younger lot are able to accept the disease because of increased information. It may still be an uphill task for the older generation to accept the problem, as shown in the case of 26-year-old Liya, the youngest of the group, when she told her mother-in-law to be about her addiction.

“She jumped out of her skin. She kept telling me how they came from a ‘simple’ ‘good’ family. I don’t think she could even fathom it,” said Liya, who first started drinking at the age of 13.

Priya*, 29, had vowed that she would never touch alcohol after growing up watching her alcoholic father. However, when she was 17, her father sobered up, and Priya had her first taste of a cocktail – a mojito.

What had first started as a “social lubricant,” alcohol soon started to dictate her life. Priya hit rock bottom when she had a blackout and fell from the second floor balcony and had to be hospitalised.

She went into recovery when she was 23, and has not had a drink since. She now volunteers with AA and travels around to help create more awareness about the problem and the programme.

“It is not that Delhi has a bigger problem. I have been to north eastern states, where almost every second or third house has a female alcoholic. It is also because some of these states are matriarchal. In Delhi, I think we are just more accepting, which makes it easier for women to seek help. I remember my mother was not ashamed when I had to check in to rehabilitation centre. We did not shout it from the rooftops, but she was more concerned about my well being than what others would think,” she said.

For 37-year-old south Delhi girl Kritika*, who has now been sober for around two and a half years, the stigma is a matter of the past. “There is no stigma anymore, at least I have not faced it in my circles. You go to Hauz Khas Village right now, and you will see how many people are getting drunk. So people are used to drinking problems. Addiction is a pathological dependence on a substance. If anyone is going to stigmatise that, you are destroying other people’s lives,” she said, while admitting that she may be afforded the luxury because of her socioeconomic background.

Benefits of AA Meetings,"The fact that many have won the battle over the bottle, shows you that life without liquor is possible.",,2003-06-28T21:20Z,"You are among people who have or had problems and experiences similar to yours. The fact that many have won the battle over the bottle, shows you that life without liquor is possible. And perhaps even enjoyable.

Sharing: When we speak aloud about our own experiences or problems, we begin to look facts in the face. Speaking aloud also has a therapeutic effect in that it helps us get a better understanding of the problem.

Listening: This is as important as sharing. You hear about a problem just like yours from another source, with detachment. This helps you judge the problem without bias. This provides you with an insight into a common predicament.

"Narcotics Anonmyous helps kick drug addiction, one day at a time","Narcotics Anonymous is a non-profit, international community working for recovering addicts in over 60 countries.",,2015-12-06T14:10Z,"He was only eight when his father handed him his first packet. His father was also an addict, a fact that he didn’t know then. The packet of drugs instead helped the father bond with his son.

Occasionally rubbing his palms and wiping sweat from his forehead on a December evening, he said that a major part of his life was spent feeling extremely depressed and vulnerable, even in his private space.

As a doctor, he said, he kept abusing drugs — in between treating patients — in order to create a façade of being normal and “staying sane”.

For him, it was not difficult laying hands on even the most restricted of drugs, thanks to his profession. That was till he found solace in Narcotics Anonymous after about 30 years of addiction.

Narcotics Anonymous is a non-profit, international community working for recovering addicts in over 60 countries.

“I knew I had to stop when I hit rock bottom at the age of 46. I was tired of pretending to be a person that I was not. I have seen psychiatrists and often had a feeling that I was going mad,” said the former drug addict with sweaty, shivering hands but a stern voice.

His eyes had drooped and he looked older than his age. But he decided to fight his addiction and kept at it till he managed to pull himself out of the pit after years of addiction. He failed several times. But every time he slipped, there was Narcotics Anonymous and people like him at the community who gave him the support and helped him get back up and fight.

For members of the community, Friday was just another day in their attempt to stay away from their addiction. Inside a small classroom at south Delhi’s Fr. Agnel School, Gautam Nagar, members sat in a circle, sharing stories of recovery from years of substance abuse — heroin, cocaine, hash, LSD, snakebite or whatever else that would come as a temporary ‘relief’.

“The best part about this place is that I do not have to worry about being judged. These people are as imperfect and messed up as I am. Everyone has a story which is similar to mine and this makes the ongoing struggle easier. One day at a time, but we are getting there,” said another member.

This member is a resident of Australia and finds time to attend Narcotics Anonymous meetings in whichever country he is staying at. Much like Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous also has regular meetings on scheduled days. At least four groups of Narcotics Anonymous hold meetings in different parts of the city, where professionals, students, working women and visitors to the city gather and talk about living without drugs for one day at a time.

On Friday — amidst overflowing emotions, a few breakdowns, laughs and some fits of anger — a ‘trusted member’ sat quietly in a corner waiting for his turn to share his experience.

After a moment of initial hesitation, he started: “I grew up in a perfect Indian family. So, like the scene in most middle-class families, whatever I did in life was never good enough for my parents. My entire life was a fight of trying to fit into their perfect world. But every time there was a rough edge left,” he said with an expressionless face, eyes glued to a corner of the room.

“When I joined college and started doing drugs with my group, it was the first time I felt that I fit in somewhere. It was like I belonged there. Years after when I came here, I somehow get the same feeling. It is like I belong here,” he said.

The meeting ended with a prayer where all the members held hands as if giving each other hope and confidence to choose life for another day. Because they were all like “square pegs in a round world” and somehow everyone just fitted in.

The destroyer of all that is… good,"Fire gives us warmth, but it also burns us. We use it to our advantage, but never get too close to it. Our sense of survival and self-preservation kicks in the moment it gets too close to us. How come that doesn’t happen with alcohol? Aamir Khan writes.",,2012-07-01T23:11Z,"Fire gives us warmth, but it also burns us. We use it to our advantage, but never get too close to it. Our sense of survival and self-preservation kicks in the moment it gets too close to us. How come that doesn’t happen with alcohol? In fact, alcohol doesn’t even come with all the various benefits of fire, but in terms of its ability to destroy, I might say it is as devastating, if not more… certainly more treacherous!

Across the country, in every state, alcoholism has destroyed scores of families. It’s a disease, which may afflict one member of the family, but its symptoms, and the destruction it causes, spreads to the whole family. It contributes to domestic violence… it affects the education of children… it affects the ability of a family to spend on healthcare… causes unemployment… These are just a few examples of the collateral damage it causes.

When I used the word ‘disease’ to describe alcoholism, I was not using the word lightly. Today, studies have shown that it is in fact a disease and not a ‘bad habit’ that most of us perceive it to be. Some of us are potential alcoholics, and when such people start to drink, we find ourselves getting sucked into it more and more, and try as we might we are unable to come out of it. It’s like a whirlpool which sucks you in. Unfortunately there is no medical test available which can warn you of this.

There are four indications that you may be headed towards alcoholism. They can be easily remembered as the acronym, C.A.G.E. Cut, Anger, Guilt and Eye opener. Ask yourself the following four questions, one “yes” response suggests an alcohol use problem. More than one “yes” is a strong indication that a problem exists.

1. Cut: Are people who are very close to you, repeatedly telling you that you need to CUT down on your drinking?

2. Anger: Are you getting ANGRY and upset as a result of people close to you telling you that you should cut down on your drinking?

3. Guilt: Are you promising yourself that you will not go beyond a certain number of drinks today, and then once you start drinking you are unable to control yourself, and then the next day you feel guilty and upset with yourself for not being able to stick to your resolution?

4. Eye-Opener: Have you now reached a stage in your life when you sometimes need alcohol to start your day? You wake up in the morning and you realize that you are unable to start your day, unable to function, without having a drink.

Unfortunately, there is no medicine that can cure us of this disease of alcoholism. But there is an organization which can help us if we so decide, and that is, Alcoholics Anonymous. Alcoholics Anonymous is a worldwide organization, and it has so far helped three hundred million people all over the world. In India too they have many centers and are spread across the country. Following are their contact details. To reach AA by phone, call +919022771011. To reach AA by text message, type AAAA <space> your name, address and contact number, and send the SMS to 56363.

Of all the people who consume alcohol, not everybody becomes an alcoholic. In fact, as per experts, of all the people who consume alcohol in India, one in twenty, that is 5%, become alcoholics. But one in two, that is 50%, indulge in what is called ‘hazardous drinking’. So, you may not drink everyday, and you may not be an alcoholic, but every time you drink, you drink so much, that, you are no longer in your senses, and you cause harm to yourself and to others. Or, you may consume just one or two pegs and still behave in a hazardous manner… for example by driving a car after that.

How many times have I heard these lines said by a drunk person… “I’m not drunk, I can drive, I’m in my senses” … or, “ Chill yaar, don’t stress, I’ve had just two drinks, I am totally in control”.

Hello?!!!

Every drunk person thinks he is the cat’s whiskers and a superhuman in every way! Absurd! A car is like a killing machine in the hands of a person who has consumed even a little alcohol! And if you have decided to sit in the driver’s seat after consuming any quantity of alcohol then you should be treated as a potential murderer.

40-60% of all cases coming into Emergency rooms of hospitals in India are alcohol related! 35% of those are people who themselves have consumed alcohol, and 65% are people who have not consumed alcohol themselves but have been injured by someone else who has.

So guys, if we can live without alcohol… nothing better than that. But if some of us want to drink, then let’s at least be responsible about it!

When I was going through all the research material and interviews for this topic, I was completely shattered after watching the testimony of Mr. Sumir Anand. The tragic story of how he, and his wife Gitika, lost their 14 year old son, Curran, was really heartbreaking. It’s like a nightmare that every parent dreams a thousand times! The first thing I did after watching the testimony was to call up my children Ira and Junaid, who are 13 and 18 respectively, and I asked him to come home. I showed them Mr. Anand’s interview. And what I made them promise me then, is the promise that I think all of us ought to make to ourselves, and that is:

NEVER drink and drive! And, NEVER sit in a car when the person driving has consumed even one drop of alcohol! Make this a rule for life!

Jai Hind! Satyamev Jayate!

Rehan, Cough syrup addict

“I am an addict. I didn’t have issues when growing up. In fact, it was a happy, upper-middle class childhood. Neither was there any alcoholism in the family. My dad drank every day but in moderation.

It was on a school trip in my 11th standard that I tasted beer for the first time. I hated the taste. But I was still getting sloshed every single day. By my twelfth standard, most of my core group was using hash, grass and cough syrup. I looked down on every friend of mine who did drugs.About six months later, a new friend pushed me to try cough syrup. Nothing happened initially. I went home and that’s when it hit me. It was such a strong feeling, I couldn’t shake it off. I experimented with marijuana, pills, and alcohol – but cough syrup kept pulling me. At my peak, I was downing about six bottles daily. I hid it well and no one found out. It took me a long time to admit I had a problem. At one point, I told my dad. He said ""Buri aadat hai, bete, par choot jayegi."" I wanted to scream no, I’m reaching out for help.I heard about Narcotics Anonymous in 1995. At first I thought, this isn’t for me. I was sure I could quit on my own. My friend kept pushing me to attend the meetings. At one point, I accepted that I can’t fight it on my own. A year and a half later, I was clean.The first day was difficult. There were withdrawal symptoms. Now, it’s been over 12 years and I am a marketing professional. I have a beautiful wife, a two and a half year old daughter; there’s another baby on the way; I have a wide circle of friends; what more do I need, honestly?""I blame my addiction on the environment I grew up in. There wasn’t anything in particular. I was just a loner and stressed out for some reason. Normal people go from school to college to a job. I went from school to college to not passing out of college and doing drugs.I first smoked marijuana in my first year because I hated engineering. My parents wanted me to go into the Merchant Navy, another thing I had no interest in. So marijuana was awesome. It made my mind shut up for an hour or two. Slowly, I started using harder drugs.There came a point a few years later when I did not remember one moment from the next. I almost went senile. At the peak, I would wake up and just head straight to my peddler. He opened shop at half past eight. I used to be plonked outside at a quarter past. I became so pally with him that I used to even get drugs on credit, which is an amazing achievement.It was only a matter of time before my parents found out. Fortunately, they were very supportive. My mother asked me if I wanted to go into rehab and I instantly said yes.Less than two hours later, I was in rehab. But 15 days later, I ran away. I roamed around all day in Delhi scoring drugs and doing them in an auto. Four o’clock on a Tuesday morning found me on a strange Delhi road with no money to pay the autowalla. That’s when the sense of guilt and shame hit me and hit me hard.I didn’t want to go back into the rehab but I had no choice. It was there that I found out about NA. I was told that you can’t go back to your old life. I stuck around because I did not have anything to look forward to. I was empty and fearful.After I got out from rehab, I did stay clean. But I still kept coming to NA meetings. They gave me a platform to be myself. I made friends. People wore nice clothes; they were happy! For the first time in three years, I laughed.My life is so perfect now I could never have imagined it. I was always afraid of relationships but I got into my first one at an NA meeting. I’ve always looked forward since then, never behind. I’ve been clean for four years now. I love to play music, I love to write. I am doing all the things I really wanted to do. Today, I don’t need a reason to laugh. I just do.

Ruby, Drug addict

I came from a small town. There were a lot of problems in the family when I was growing up. Money was never enough; there was a lot of mental, physical, sexual abuse. I didn’t have a normal childhood.

I came to Delhi in my 11th standard, because I wanted to get away from it all. However, I still felt isolated. So it was in my first year that I had my first drink. I remember downing pegs of neat rum, puking and blacking out.It gave me an immense sense of relief from everything. I felt complete. I started with alcohol and in a few years, I was having it all. It was a fantastic relationship I had with drugs: I didn’t have to put any effort into it, I just had to ingest them.It was only a few years down the line that the downward spiral began. I lost my job; my boyfriend, also a junkie, left me; my health went for a toss; at my lowest point, I thought I was going to die and not be found till way later.I found out about NA in a dramatic fashion. I was reading a book which mentioned Alcoholics Anonymous and I thought, if there’s one for alcoholics, maybe there’s one for narcotics users. I went online and discovered there was one in Delhi very close to where I did my drugs! So I went to a meeting.That was the first time I discovered that addiction is a disease. For years, I had had fingers pointed at me – in our society, a woman doing drugs is worse than guys doing them. But then, I realised that while I was not responsible for the disease, I was responsible for the recovery. I kept attending meetings for a year. Sometimes, I would use before the meetings. But people said, it doesn’t matter, just keep coming, one day, the miracle will happen to you.And guess what? One day, it did. Over the last five and a half years, my life has changed completely. When I first stayed away from drugs for 24 hours, the relief was difficult to put in words. Today, I am a responsible person. I love my job. I take squash and salsa lessons. I have friends who I can share stuff with without being embarrassed. And my relationship with my family has never been better.Addiction is severe dependence on a particular substance. Some addictions can be dealt on one’s own, but heavy use of opiates, cannabis, alcohol and psychotropic drugs requires patients to be sent to a rehabilitation centre. This process has three phases:

Detoxification: To counter initial withdrawal and drastic mood swings, you need to detoxify the patient with vitamin supplements and lots of fluids.

Abstinence: The toughest part of rehab is to keep patients motivated to give up the addiction. You monitor their psychological behaviour and teach self-control. It is also important to make them confident so that they do not succumb again. Sometimes, group therapy is needed, and in severe cases, medication.

Maintenance: It is imperative to counsel friends and family on how to deal with a patient after he or she is out of rehab. Rehabilitation is successful when people around the patient learn to treat him or her with respect.

A patient’s success is dependent on her or his willingness to change. Some addicts require continual support.

Celebrities who overcame their addiction



Angelina Jolie: In 1998, Jolie confessed to doing “just about every drug possible”. Since then, she has become an Oscar-winning actress, a mother of six and even a UN Goodwill Ambassador.

Drew Barrymore: By 11, Barrymore was an alcoholic. By 12, she was doing marijuana, by 13 cocaine. She went to rehab twice and attempted suicide at 14. Today, she is an accomplished actress and producer.

Robin Williams: It’s hard to believe that the movie star and comedian was once a cocaine addict. But after the death of fellow comedian John Belushi, Williams checked into rehab.

Drowning in her drink,"Think alcoholics, and you think of glassy-eyed men, staggering all over the place, clutching on to a bottle of booze.

But now it’s time to be less sexist as women alcoholics are suddenly tumbling out of the closet. According to Dr Nikhil Raheja, a Dwarka-based psychiatrist and therapist, alcoholism in women is growing at an alarming rate of around 10 per cent. “Even five years ago, we had no women patients,” he says.

At the Masihgarh Church in Sukhdev Vihar — where meetings for Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) are held regularly — there are 14 women who attend meetings now. And Dr Megha Hazuria Gore, clinical psychologist at Max Health Care, agrees that an increasing number of women are admitting to alcohol problem and seeking treatment for it. “Women today see drinking as a part of acceptable social behaviour,” she feels.

Teesta was an alcoholic for 12 years before joining the AA fellowship. Early on, as a newly-wed, her reason for hitting the bottle was a rapidly souring marriage to an abusive husband. “I drank for the high,” she says. Then, there came a time when she’d have blackouts: “I felt I would die without my drink."" Three years ago, she kicked the habit.

Vinita, 32, an ex-airline hostess, started drinking in her early twenties. “I’d finish a bottle of vodka in my room at night when everybody was asleep,” she admits.

It’s not just a bad marriage/love life or stress that’s making women take to the bottle. A case of social drinking gone wrong, Anjali, a naval officer's wife says the frequent cocktail parties are what made her take to liquor. “How long can you sip Coca-Cola wearing high heels?”

The lowest common denominators for these women seem to be: they belong to the upper middle class, are educated and have the money to buy the bottles.

At the Masihgarh Church in Sukhdev Vihar — where meetings for Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) are held regularly — there are 14 women who attend meetings now.
Then, there came a time when she’d have blackouts: “I felt I would die without my drink.""
A case of social drinking gone wrong, Anjali, a naval officer's wife says the frequent cocktail parties are what made her take to liquor."
Contentment sutra: how to make peace with yourself,"There will be some things in life that none of us can have any control over- from friendships running their course to your teenage kid hating you. But the sooner we come to terms with them, the more content we shall be, writes Seema Goswami.",,2014-02-08T13:02Z,"Lord, grant me the strength to accept the things I cannot change; the courage to change the things I can; and the wisdom to know the difference.” This verse, attributed to St Francis of Assisi and later adapted by the American theologian, Reinhold Niebuhr, is now widely used by Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programmes, with the word ‘strength’ replaced by ‘serenity’ and called the Serenity Prayer. But you don’t need to be an alcoholic – or even a Catholic – to benefit from the sentiments expressed in this prayer.

All of us would be better off if we could see the difference between the things that we can change and those we can’t. And we would be much happier if we could make our peace with all the stuff that comes in the ‘can’t’ category. Because let’s face it, there are some things in life that none of us have any control over. And the sooner we come to terms with that fact, the more content we shall be.

So, what are the things you need to make your peace with? Allow me to list, in no particular order of importance, just some of them.

Some friendships will run their course



This is not anybody’s fault. It is just the way things are. Sometimes people grow apart for one reason or the other.

And when that happens, there is no point breaking your head over what went wrong.

Or even trying to recapture that lost intimacy. The only option is to accept the inevitable and move on without any bitterness or regret. Tell yourself that it was good while it lasted – and yes, that nothing lasts forever.

Your teenage kids will hate you

They will act as if your very presence is an embarrassment. They will fob off public displays of affection. They will treat your every pronouncement with derision.

They will spend ages in the bathroom, sulking and yes, hating you.

Until suddenly, one day, they won’t. They will want to hang out with you again, they will ask your advice and cuddles will once again be welcome.

Just stay the course. Normal service will be resumed soon.

You will turn into your parents

It is only a matter of time. It’s not just that one day you will look into the mirror and find your mother or father staring back at you (though that will happen as well). But that you will find yourself telling your kids the very things that your parents used to say to you (and which you swore you would never tell your kids). ‘Come home before it gets dark’. ‘Get up early and study’. ‘Wrap yourself warm before you go out’. ‘Eat something, for God’s sake’.

There will be more ‘doorway moments’ as you get older

If you are in your 40s, you probably know what I mean. Yes, the times you go through the doorway of your bedroom or living room looking for something. But the moment you cross the threshold, you forget what you were looking for. Recent research done by Professor Gabriel Radvansky of the University of Notre Dame has it that the act of passing through a doorway causes memory lapses. But we know different, don’t we? It’s the act of passing through several decades of our lives that really does the trick. You’ve just got to live with it.

The music of the day will begin to seem like senseless noise to you

And you will turn into the kind of music bore you always made fun of.

The sort who listens to the same bands and singers over and over again because he or she grew up with them.

As they don’t say, familiarity breeds contentment.

You will always have regrets

No matter what choices you make in life and no matter how right they seemed at the time, there will come a day when you start to wonder about the road not taken and whether you took a wrong turn along the way. Don’t freak out. This is a part of growing up and even – dare I say it? – growing old. And anyone who tells you otherwise is a lying sod.

Help our execs stay sober: Companies to AA,"As the economic slowdown forces city executives to work harder to keep their jobs, many are taking to the bottle, reports Aditya Ghosh.",,2009-01-20T14:11Z,"As the economic slowdown forces city executives to work harder to keep their jobs, many are taking to the bottle. This has taken such a toll on their productivity that at least 25 companies, including many top blue chips, have approached the Indian chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous for help over the past six months.

To cope with the flood of requests, the Indian branch of the self-help group had to ask for help from its offices in the US and Canada.

“This is a global phenomenon now and is expected to be here for sometime,” said Leonard Blumenthal, AA general service board chairman, who is in India to help the local branch. “It is great that the problem is being recognised.”

“The corporate sector was initially reluctant to come out in the open, but with the downturn the problem compounded,” said R. Sharma, a senior AA office-bearer in Mumbai. “Now we receive calls almost every day.”

Background search companies confirmed that alcoholism had risen with meltdown. “We find many more cases when we investigate people,” said Ashish Dehade, managing director, First Advantage.

On Saturday, about 15 firms met AA’s global team. The firms requested Hindustan Times to not disclose their identities, but seven of them said their staff had drinking problems. “Over the past six months, alcoholism has become a major issue,” said the HR head of a leading FMCG company.

“At a workshop for all staff, about 20 people admitted that they were already AA fellows,” said an HR manager of a textile company. “This encouraged others to ask for help.”

“Our US experience was similar. Once people were convinced companies would sympathise with them, many more volunteered,” said Bluementhal.

In the public sector, the municipal corporation, the Mumbai Police and Railway Protection Force were the first ones to seek help.

Mumbai police surgeon S.M. Patil praised the intervention at the police hospital in Nagpada. “Peer-group counselling and treating alcholism like any other disease helped a lot.”

The additional municipal commissioner (city), waste disposal, whose department conducted two workshops, did not respond to Hindustan Times’ text messages and phone calls.

Is change here to stay?,"For 13 weeks, we woke up to Aamir Khan trying to change the world. But how long will Satyamev Jayate’s effects last? Amrah Ashraf finds out...",,2012-08-04T11:40Z,"Satyamev Jayate. If you’d been watching the show, you know what a roller coaster ride it’s been. Even if you haven’t, you can’t have escaped the after-show talk, the opinions, the shock, the awe. The nation oscillated between tears and disbelief, anger and despair, criticism and pride. But many saw a ray of hope.Kumar Gaurav Khagaria is one of them. The episode about the intolerance to love unearthed memories he and his family had buried four years ago, when the Khagaria home in Bihar was fired at and his father was kidnapped and tortured. Their fault? His brother had married outside the caste without parental and (crucially) community consent. ""That episode made me realise that we were not alone. The past came rushing back but I drew strength from it. I am no longer scared,"" he says.Many of the show’s 50 crore viewers have had similar catharses, rare for Sunday morning TV. But has it resulted in mass awakening or just made old issues simmer a new?""You look at the garbage strewn around your neighbourhood but you [mostly] ignore it. But if someone was to dump it in front of your house, you would react. That is what the show has done,"" says Parvathi Om, a Bangalore based social activist. ""It managed to dump the reality in front of people and made them react."" That’s exactly what the show was hoping for. ""Aamir [Khan] told us that we must work on concepts that incite people to wake up from this apathy,"" says Svati Chakravarty, head of research, Aamir Khan Productions and Star India for Satyamev Jayate.For many, it has been enough that Khan, despite the tears, has managed to stir up the nation and the political system in a small way. It has urged the Rajasthan State Government to set up a fast-track court for female foeticide cases. It’s sparked protests against toxic food in Delhi. Clinics and doctors in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh lost their licences over their sex determination practices. Bhopal’s Child Welfare Committee received over a dozen new cases after the episode about child sexual abuse. Alcoholics Anonymous India had more than 1,67,000 phone calls after the one about alcohol abuse. ""We do not advertise. But now people know that there is help and where to call"" says the general manager of AA who goes by the alias Naneshwar.

Ripple effect

As the credits rolled on the final episode, one thing was clear – change was inevitable. “The national advisory council gave its final verdict on the new law on disability: all four present laws will be ‘merged’ to avoid inconsistencies that plague the cause,” says Parul Ghosh, senior project coordinator (advocacy) at the National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People. “I was a little disappointed since they only talked about education and schools. What about policies, laws, advocacy? That aspect was ignored,” she adds.

But even before the laws come into effect, change is sweeping into living rooms. Victims of domestic violence are bravely watching the show next to their abusive husbands. Sex abusers squirm when they’ve seen people like them on screen. “I faced child sexual abuse by my cousin brother for almost 12 years,” says a BSc student of Christian College, Lucknow. “It so happened that we watched the episode together and I could see the discomfort in his body language.” The abuse has stopped since that day.



Star India CEO Uday Shankar

The man behind the dream

Star India CEO Uday Shankar was the man who first approached Aamir Khan to do a different kind of show. Did it pay off? Poonam Saxena asks.

How did you come up with the idea of Satyamev Jayate?

Around three years ago I met him and told him that he was limiting his reach by restricting himself to Bollywood. He agreed. He said he recognised the power of TV. But he wasn’t sure what he wanted to do, except that he didn’t want to do the regular stuff. Even then, we agreed that if we worked together, it would be in the area of social change. The needle really moved only a year later when he said yes.

Did you intend the show to become a sort of movement?

No, I don’t think movements can be created like this. But we wanted it to be something more than a TV show. There are issues that concern every Indian. We wanted to ensure that we got these concerns across to as many Indians as possible. That’s why it was telecast on every Star channel.

The show was discussed a lot online and in print. But is that a sufficient indication of success?

The total digital impression for Satyamev Jayate is a billion plus. If such a large number of people connected with the show, that’s something. We, the media, are not social reformers. But we can create an awareness and polarisation of points of view. Very few shows create a stir in society. Our job was to create that stir.

Wasn’t it a big gamble?

Yes. But you’ll notice that we put the most disturbing subjects – child sexual abuse – right in the beginning. We didn’t know how people would react but this is our show and we wanted to be upfront about it.

Delhi's sex addicts come together to share and heal,"All the eight men in the group, the youngest being a college student and the oldest a retired professional, are strangers to each other and want to remain so. They use assumed names and are part of the Delhi chapter of Sex Addicts Anonymous (SAA). Are you a sex addict?",,2014-05-04T00:50Z,"“Hi, I’m Tarun and I’m a sex addict,” said a young man dressed in smart casuals to a small group of people seated in a circle.

Tarun, a professional in his mid-20s, started masturbating to porn when he was 11 and was soon hooked. “Before I knew it, I was addicted to porn and it got so bad a few years ago that I started touching and feeling up women in the Metro,” said Tarun, revealing his darkest secrets to the small group listening intently.

All the eight men in the group, the youngest being a teenage college student and the oldest a retired professional in his mid-sixties, are strangers to each other and want to remain so. They use assumed names and are part of the Delhi chapter of Sex Addicts Anonymous (SAA).



Click to take our quiz:Are you a sex addict?



Started more than a year ago, the Delhi chapter of the SAA was the first of its kind in India. “During my stay in the US, I chanced upon several SAA chapters and saw how it was helping people,” said Ramesh, secretary of the Delhi chapter.

“I realized that not everyone could afford to come to the US for rehabilitation. So I decided to start a chapter here,” he added. SAA has chapters in Ahmedabad and Bangalore as well.

The group connects through the website, emails and word-of-mouth to meet every Monday between 6.30pm and 8.30pm in a room in a staid office building near Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, opposite south Delhi’s Vasant Kunj area. Each session has around eight to 10 members.



“Timely help can prevent sex addicts from becoming sexual offenders,” believes Ramesh. This is especially important in a city like Delhi, where nearly 10 cases of molestation are registered daily, apart from countless unreported instances of sexual harassment.

SAA follows a ‘Twelve Step’ de-addiction programme based on a template set by Alcoholics Anonymous.

“Group members share their stories and function as a support group for fellow addicts. For most of them, this is the only support they have against an addiction they are too embarrassed to mention even to family and close friends.

Tarun heard about the group five months ago when he stumbled on the SAA website while surfing the internet looking for solution to his disorder. “Sex addiction was affecting my personal and professional life but going to psychologists didn’t help. I would feel restless all the time and didn’t feel like working,” he said. “My life has changed since I started attending SAA meetings. I don’t feel the urge for frequent gratification anymore,” said Tarun, who has since got engaged and is looking forward to a happily-married life.

Others like him who have been cured of sex addiction after SAA sessions are encouraged to attend meetings to mentor new members and prevent a relapse. There are no clinics for sex de-addiction. ""There are no medicines for sex addiction and it is treated using psychotherapy, but only a handful of doctors are trained for this,"" said clinical psychologist Dr Pulkit Sharma. ""Many doctors, in fact, are uncomfortable treating people with sexual disorders,"" he said.

(Some names have been changed to protect identity).

The addict is dead...,...Long live the myth. Even as no one really comes to grips with addiction,,2011-07-25T22:54Z,"Amy Winehouse is dead and any useful understanding of the mental illness that killed her seems far away. Already the portrait is painted and flat-packed, smelted and ready to become myth. There is tiny Amy with the swaying beehive hair and the frightened eyes, tormented by her talent and the chaos it brought, famous at 21, dead at 27, now a member of the repulsively named

‘27 Club’ of musicians who were also addicts and died at 27 — Joplin, Hendrix, Morrison, Cobain. All dead, all revered, as if it was their illness that made them interesting. The initial, rushed obituaries made much of Winehouse ‘making it’ into the 27 Club. Would she make it to

28 and be shut out? No, she got in, with 54 days to spare.

Why do we give so much energy to the thrilling pantomime of an alcoholic dying in the public eye, and so little to understanding the illness that took her there? It was obvious years ago that ‘Winehouse sick’ was more grotesquely interesting than ‘Winehouse sober’; as she temporarily dried out, so did the press coverage. But she relapsed, and came home to fame.

When an addict self-annihilates, stalked by paparazzi, it is easy to imagine the story belongs to us all. We all had a stake in Winehouse, you might believe; her fall, and the redemption that will never come now, had a universal meaning. But it didn’t. Winehouse didn’t belong to us; she belonged to no one, not even herself. But you can forget that. Creative addicts — particularly female creative addicts — are always clutched to the cold global breast, even as the corpse is carried out.

Thousands like Winehouse die every year, and they are not venerated, or even pitied. We will not educate ourselves about the disease, or reform drug laws that plunge addicts into a shadow-world of criminality and dependence on criminals. Winehouse got away with too much, said one copper, after a tape of her using was released. Did she? Did she really? Winehouse walked barefoot through the streets because that is where the drugs were, and even as her bewildered face splatters across the front pages, drug support charities are closing, expendable in this era of thrift. Recovery rests on the edge of the self-harming knife, because no one yet knows what causes addiction, or how to cure it.

The disease is impenetrable to outsiders because it is anathema to our all-conquering species that a person can be genetically predisposed to poison themselves. Addiction is still uniformly called ‘a self-inflicted disease’ and only the most enlightened doctors will recommend Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous, self-help groups that sometimes get results, although no one knows why. A Harley Street psychiatrist once told me that I should try and “limit” my drug use; he obviously knew nothing, even as he charged £275 for 15 minutes.

Winehouse’s new album will be released and it will sell 10 million copies, maybe more. And there, reader, is your meaning. The addict is dead. Long live the myth. The Guardian

Drink habits: A toast to the new cocktails,"In a large-sample study conducted in Karnataka, NIMHANS found that 65 per cent of the women who drink indulge in hazardous drinking at some point of time or the other, writes Amitava Sanyal.",,2008-05-11T00:42Z,"A wife who drinks spirituous liquor, is of bad conduct, rebellious, diseased, mischievous, or wasteful, may at any time be superseded (by another wife). — Manusmriti

Though she is an alcoholic, Madhavi has not had to face the punishment prescribed by Manu. That’s because the 53-year-old from a Delhi-based Tamil Brahmin family hasn’t married yet. That did not ease her trauma though, some of which she will share again with her fellowship at the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) on May 17. It was on that date 13 years ago that she kicked the bottle. But her memories of being an alcoholic are still raw, as if they happened yesterday. She says haltingly, “Though I had been drinking for only four years, towards the end I was counting my days. I could not even hold a pen and sign cheques.” Her sister found out about AA, Madhavi emerged from her nightmare, and in 1997, went on to start in the Capital the country’s first all-women AA chapter. Today, this chapter attracts at least 10 women everyday, says Madhavi. Why such a low attendance? “Most of the women who stay sober stop coming regularly after 3-4 years, because almost all of them are married — and there is always a greater pressure on women to perform in the household. And we are hardly visited by women below the age of 30, though there are many ‘boys’ in the fellowship. It possibly has to do with the greater stigma that’s applicable to the unmarried woman.”

It’s also true that there are far less women than men alcohol drinkers in the country: roughly one woman to every four male drinkers. But the changing pattern of usage is worth a closer look. In a large-sample study conducted in Karnataka by the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences found that 65 per cent of the women who drink indulge in hazardous drinking at some point of time or the other (against 80 per cent of men). And that women seem to drink less in a positive frame of mind than men. But the drunken violence that’s often the result of such drinking is a preserve of men. Though the incidence of hazardous drinking is as high among the women of rural India as men, they end up being beaten up most of the times.

Shanthi Ranganathan, founder of TTK Foundation in Chennai, the country’s first rehabilitation centre, says, “This part of the country is full of self-help groups working on micro-credit. The financial independence these women get from the job is all wasted by their men who drink and then beat them up. Some have begun to understand the power of groups and are using that to shift out liquor shops.”

Molly Charles, former deputy director at the National Addiction Research Centre in Mumbai, says, “When the financial power equation changes, men either drink more or accommodate.” Here’s hoping that more opt for the latter.

Close brushes: Phil Collins says he nearly died from excessive drinking,Veteran musician Phil Collins says he was forced to quit drinking after he was diagnosed with a severe case of pancreatitis.

The 63-year-old says he began drinking heavily after stepping away from the music industry in 2010.



Collins' boozing became so bad, he began attending Alcoholics Anonymous (Aa) meetings and spent a week in rehab, but he did not take his problems seriously until he was diagnosed with pancreatitis, an inflammation of the pancreas, which causes internal bleeding and extreme pain.



Collins insists his problems began after his ex-wife remarried and moved from Switzerland to Miami, Florida with their two youngest children, reports contactmusic.com.

He said: ""I nearly died. I had pancreatitis... I'd retired to be with the kids... And really, retiring - well not working - and not having the kids, I guess left a big void... I was supposed to be an alcoholic... I went to meetings and I did try rehab - for a week.



“But I couldn't stand it. It was like being at boarding school. So I said to myself, 'I know what I need to do, I'm not a f*****g alcoholic... I was taking medication for this (tendon problems) and for all kinds of different little things. (The prescription pills) were not mixing with the drink, basically...



“The kids were getting a little worried and that's what made me worried... I found myself a great doctor here in America, and I went to a couple of specialists. And I don't drink any more. And I've never fallen off the wagon. I've just been lucky.""

Drinker in a dry land,"He landed in Gujarat to discover for himself how dry is dry in a state with no bars. He did find a few swigs of alcohol in the end, but no satisfaction. Soumya Bhattacharya tells more.",,2009-07-18T21:51Z,"How odd it is, I think with a mixture of fear and loathing as the plane circles above Ahmedabad, a shining spittle of rain, like a glob of mercury, clinging to the window on my left; how odd it is, I think, to be not able to go to a bar on the first evening of my visit to a new city and get a sense of the place at which I have turned up.

You don’t go to bars in Ahmedabad — or anywhere else in Gujarat. You can’t go to them. There aren’t any. There never have been, in the 49 years that Gujarat has been a state.

India ka daru data * Permits are granted in Maharashtra for foreign liquor. ‘Health permit’ is granted to anyone above 40 who requires this liquor for maintaining his health * Wardha is the only ‘dry’ district in Maharashtra because Sevagram, Mahatama Gandhi’s ashram is located here. As for the rest of Maharashtra, you have to be 21 and have a valid permit to consume alcohol. In cities like Mumbai, there are hardly any checks conducted on whether a drinker has a permit. One-day permits are available at restaurants. A foreign passport is also your permit * Tamil Nadu and Kerala are two south Indian states where liquor is sold through government outlets. In Tamil Nadu, selling Indian Made Foreign Liquor is a privilege of the Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation Limited to curb spurious liquor sale and organised monopoly * All liquor outlets in Kerala are run by the state-owned Kerala State Beverages (Manufacturing and Marketing) Corporation Limited. But liquor smuggling from nearby Mahe is rampant because it’s cheaper and of wider variety * According to the Delhi excise department rules, no liquor shop for consumption off/on its premises shall be located 75 metres from colonies of labourers and ‘harijans’ (as the excise department classifies Dalits). You’re forbidden from buying alcohol if you are below 25 years of age * The Sikkim government levies educational cess of Rs 2.70 on every bulk litre of foreign liquor and Rs 1.60 on every bulk litre of beer manufactured in Sikkim and imported from other states for consumption in civil market and army units in the state * UP has banned the sale of country liquor in plastic pouches since 150 crore of these were being dumped each year causing environmental damage

For someone like me, it is difficult to come to terms with this. What’s dry? How dry is dry? That’s why I am here. To see what it is like to be a drinker in a dry land; to carry out my own experiments with a certain kind of truth.

It is also a thought experiment, of making minor adjustments in my instinctive responses to things. “Let’s meet for a drink” or “What will you have to drink?” are phrases I begin to learn to not use. (No, not, can’t, aren’t… It seems to me very quickly that certain things here are defined entirely by negatives.)

At a kebab-and-biryani festival at the hotel, I know what’s missing: the beer. I don’t ask for it. I don’t have aerated drinks. I have never in my life drunk so much mineral water as I do during my stay in Gujarat.

It is an appropriate time for this experiment. A week ago, 130 people died from drinking illicit liquor here: proof enough — if any were needed — that while you may not legally allow alcohol to be sold or served, you won’t ever stop people from drinking it if they want to.

If they want to. If I want to. What should I do, then, if I want to have a drink? Like a participant in a big-money TV quiz show, I phone a friend. “The bars are mobile. If you can’t go to a bar, the bar will come to you.” I can hear the smirk.

“Everybody drinks in cars here. Buy a can of cola, take a swig, mix in the rum and pass it around between friends.

Even the soft-drink sellers know. So they’ll have colas ready on the counter at a certain time of the day for some, sodas for others. Drive around for an hour or so, and you’re done.”

“That’s disgusting,” I say. “Where’s the pleasure in that?”

“The pleasure is in the drinking. When in Rome etc. The choice is to turn teetotal,” my friend says, sounding grim.

My friend, like the dozens of people — and each of who had his own drinking story to tell — I spoke to during my stay, will remain unnamed. The police have got very strict since the tragedy. They have arrested 500 people. They want to be seen to be doing a lot. An amendment has been brought to the existing prohibition law, and the death penalty suggested for those involved in the making or distribution of spurious liquor that leads to deaths.

The bootleggers — critical to the social fabric in Gujarat — have gone underground. They will surface in a few weeks, everyone is certain. In the meantime, people have the stuff at home. Things change, things remain the same.

“Sometimes,” says someone I shall call a friend of a friend with a touch of boastfulness, “we don’t even feel we are living in a state with prohibition. We get booze delivered home.”

“Oh?” I ask.

The gentleman smiles. “Having a bootlegger is not enough. Having a reliable bootlegger is important.”

Otherwise, seals are tampered with, alcohol is diluted, toxic stuff gets in. I am told of how, only weeks ago, someone bought a bottle of whisky, and had the first sip to find a medicinal, alien taste overwhelm his palate. “I had to throw it away. It wasn’t my usual bootlegger. You need to be careful.”

Merely furtiveness won’t do if you fancy a drink here. Eternal vigilance is the key.

The reliable bootlegger, well-dressed, polite, often with a respectable job (like being in the income-tax department, say) comes home swinging a briefcase. He has tea. He opens the case, and leaves you with what you want. It’s expensive. A 750ml bottle of Smirnoff vodka costs Rs 800 — nearly double the price in Mumbai or Delhi. And the prices vary according to the scarcity.

Now is a scarce time. As were the period in the run-up to the elections. “The politicians had asked for stuff to be hoarded for them,” I am told. “Supplies dried up.”

Everyone is in on it. And the travesty is perpetuated. A senior police official died recently from heavy drinking. A crime reporter tells me that the cut money some policemen get every month is more than their salaries. People go to posh clubs, nudge and wink, the owner has a suite ready for them, and they drink behind closed doors.

But surely, they also miss the pleasure of drinking legally?

“Oh, yes, of course,” someone tells me. “There are three official watering holes for people in Gujarat. People in Surat drive to Daman. Those in Rajkot go to Diu. And we, in Ahmedabad, head for Mount Abu.”

Over there, it’s almost impossible to find rooms in hotels just across the border. People sit in bars, or in shacks on the seafront, or in chairs in balconies, and assert their right to drink without being surreptitious.

Four hours to get to a bar. What a life.

Then there are health permits that allow you a quota of alcohol every month if you can prove that you need it as medicine. “When I got mine two years ago,” someone with a mild blood pressure problem says, “I had to spend Rs 20,000 in bribes.” The rate now is said to be Rs 40,000.

Palms are greased for everything. “The police have a line with the kabadiwallahs. When you sell empty bottles, they find out where the bottles have come from. They turn up at your home, and ask for money. It is advisable to have five or ten thousand rupees handy. Who knows when you will be harassed?”

There is a reason why prohibition stays on in Gujarat. “Our women are safer on the roads here because of prohibition.

You can see them out in hundreds, on their own, late at night, during Navratri,” says Chunnabhai Vaidya, 92, president of the Gujarat Lok Samity, an NGO that works for the uplift of the rural poor. “We abide by Gandhian values. No drunkard threatens our society’s peace. Can you say that for Delhi?”

Industry estimates say Rs 2,500 crore is lost every year to the state exchequer because of prohibition. The Narendra Modi government is aware of it, although it fears a backlash from the women voters in Gujarat’s rural hinterland (where hooch is consumed widely, but still not as widely as it would be if the state were to be wet) if it does anything about it. The government has proposed that the state’s special economic zones will have no prohibition. A hesitant start.

But one does get lucky in Gujarat. Gliding along the magnificent National Expressway to Baroda, the wind whipping my face so hard I can barely keep my eyes open, I have the irresistible yearning to have a very cold beer.

Two hours later, a very cold beer is thrust into my hands. We are at the home of Rahul Gajjar, a graphic designer, and he has a health permit to drink.

We’ve been before to the University of Baroda’s department of fine arts, an old building ringed with eucalyptus trees. Jayanti Rabadia, who teaches there, tells me how he made a mural out of alcohol bottles. It was shown in an exhibition in Delhi in 2006.

Another teacher talks of how some of the ex-students got busted some days ago. They were having a party. Someone — was it a neighbour? Was it some other ex-student not invited? — called the police. The young men and women spent a night at the police station, were produced in court, and paid fines of Rs 20 each to be released.

“It stops nothing,” Gajjar says. “At farmhouses on the edge of the city, booze parties are held over the weekends. Senior policemen and politicians turn up. I have been too.”

His father used to have lavish birthday parties. “The booze would come in matador vans with a police escort,” Gajjar says. Someone else talks about the “wonderful evening” he had at the home of the Deputy Superintendent of Police in Porbandar. “He lived on the floor above the police station.”

Gajjar is a member of — now hold your breath — Baroda’s Alcoholics Anonymous society. I choke on my beer. An AA in a state that has prohibition? “Surat has a huge one. There is one in Ahmedabad. Ours has 40 members.” Oh. Right.

I want very badly to have a legal drink before leaving Gujarat. It’s like a memento, like those kitschy miniatures of the Eiffel Tower you buy to show that you’ve been to Paris. I can’t drive to Mount Abu or Daman or Diu. I can’t get a health permit.

“Get a visitor’s permit,” my friend says.

I go for my permit to a legal liquor store in the premises of a five-star hotel. I show proof of my identity, plane tickets, business card, and fill in a form almost as long and convoluted as the one you do when you are applying for a US visa. It takes a very long time, but I finally have it: a licence to drink in the state, within the confines of my hotel room, within the next week. Against it, I get a 750ml bottle at almost twice the market rate in Mumbai.

Elderly Ibrahim Ranwala, who sits at the counter, tells me with a gap-toothed smile: “Now you can consume much.” I feel like a fuel-inefficient car. “But only in your room. Or else,” he wags his finger, then makes a clinking noise that mimes the gate of a prison cell closing.

Later that evening, as the cubes of ice chime into a tall glass and the vodka is splashed in in the silence of the air-conditioned hotel room, I look again at the permit, and think: No, it’s too much hard work, drinking in Gujarat. It doesn’t seem like drinking at all.

Lady GaGa doesn’t regret her stripping past,Lady GaGa has no qualms about her former stripping days that lent her support during her teens.,,2009-03-16T18:12Z,"Lady GaGa has no qualms about her former stripping days that lent her support during her teens.



The 22-year-old, born as Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, revealed she left her posh family in shock after turning to stripping at 18.

“I was working in strip clubs when I was 18. Girls from my background weren’t meant to turn into someone like me. I come from a wealthy Italian family, went to a good school,” News of the World quoted her as saying.

“I went against all I was brought up to be; I moved out of home, wouldn’t take any help from my parents and supported myself with waitressing jobs and stripping,” she added.

The pop sensation further revealed having achieved a sense of freedom with the act of dropping clothes though her parents thought otherwise.

She said: “I discovered a real personal freedom through it. Obviously my parents didn’t like it. I was drawing huge crowds, setting hairspray alight on stage and dancing madly.

“My dad thought I’d lost it. With the drugs it was his reaction that pulled me back. I didn’t go to Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous. I did it myself. I have such a fear of failure, I didn’t want anything to make me fail. So I stopped. I still drink and party, but there’s no darkness now. Just a lot of fun.”

The end is cruellest part of sport,"Although from a physical perspective, the most fascinating part of a sportsman's life are his playing days.",,2006-07-23T15:19Z,"Former football captain VP Sathyan's suicide reminds us that sportsmen work to a different rhythm from the rest of us. Between the ages of 20 and 35 they are stars, revelling in the applause, enjoying the spotlight.

Then suddenly, the light is switched off and it is all over. At an age when others are just beginning to make a mark in their chosen professions, the career of a sportsman comes to an end. The rest, in a sense, is silence.

""I had a lot of respect and admiration in society as long as I was a football player for India,"" wrote Sathyan in his poignant suicide note, ""but at present, I've lost everything. I don't want to live in this world anymore.""

Although from a physical perspective, the most fascinating part of a sportsman's life are his playing days, in a psychological sense, it is the period after the final bow that is the more interesting. The first time an ex-player walks unrecognised on his own street, he dies a little.

""How does it feel like to be a has-been?"" I once saw someone ask cricketer Gundappa Vishwanath. It was meant as a joke, but for a moment, I saw the great batsman's expression change.

It is never easy to go gentle to that good night, as the poet said; most sportsmen rage against the dying of that light.

Television-- the ex-star's more enduring playing field-- briefly resurrected Sathyan. In an interview during the 2002 World Cup, when he was a TV expert he said, ""People in my neighbourhood are suddenly curious about me. They are surprised I led India."" This was just five years after he had retired.

Sportsmen spend their entire adult life in an artificial world, with its unrealistic expectations, enormous temptations and unnatural salaries. Some find it easier to continue in the artificial world - through drugs and alcohol.

Look at Diego Maradona. Sathyan, by his own admission frittered his money on gambling and alcohol. These are but the manifestations of a deeper problem, and one which has not received much attention: the post-retirement depression.

It is a bit unfair of former captain Baichung Bhutia to place the blame for Sathyan's suicide squarely on the All India Football Federation ""which doesn't look after the players.""

It was an emotional outburst, and in an ideal world, his reaction would have made perfect sense. But it would be more practical for ex-players to form an association to look after their own. They understand the needs best, after all.

Even in death, Sathyan exhibited the signs of an organised mind. He wrote to his wife saying he was sorry, but he couldn't talk to her about his intentions because she would be able to dissuade him; he wrote to the media thanking them for support over the years, and with a plea not to sensationalise his suicide.

What cannot be prevented however is the manner in which Sathyan the individual now becomes a type.

India's leading defender becomes a symbol for the cruelty of sport, its disdain for the sagging muscle and brittle bone and its theme as enunciated by F Scott Fitzgerald in another context: There is no second act in sportsmen's lives.

Yet Sathyan's death could bring sportsmen together with the aim of preventing depression ruling the lives of former players. There is life after football (or cricket or hockey or tennis)-- but players need counselling if they are not to succumb to the confusion and rootlessness that follow retirement. Most suicides in sport occur within the first few years of retirement, when alienation is at its worst.

'Sportsmen Anonymous' might be an ironic name for a body that could make the difference for anonymity is the one thing sportsmen are running from.

But like Alcoholics Anonymous it can help sportsmen with problems of one kind (the most common one, actually), while helping them cope with sudden change in their professional lives.

In the film The Final Test, the player for whom adulation is a memory muses: ""The trouble with making a game a profession is that you're at the top too young. The rest of the way's a gentle slide down. Not so gentle sometimes. It makes one feel so ruddy useless and old.""

With the right support from professionals and ex-players, no sportsman need feel useless and old.

Gibson reaches plea deal for drunken driving,Actor Mel Gibson was sentenced to three years on probation after he pleaded no contest to drunk-driving charge.,,2006-08-18T12:39Z,"Actor Mel Gibson was sentenced to three years on probation after he pleaded no contest to a drunk-driving charge in an incident that made world headlines for his anti-Semitic tirade.

Gibson was pulled over by Los Angeles County sheriffs deputies last month while speeding in the seaside enclave of Malibu.

The actor's attorney entered the plea on his behalf before Malibu Superior Court Judge Lawrence Mira in an agreement with prosecutors that keeps the star out of jail, said Deputy District Attorney Gina Satriano.

Gibson did not appear in court yesterday for the proceedings. Under terms of the plea deal, Mira ordered the 50-year-old actor to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings five times a week for 4-1/2 months and three AA meetings per week for the remaining 7-1/2 months.

Gibson also was ordered to enroll in an alcohol abuse programme for three months and was fined $1,300.

In addition, the star volunteered to make a public service announcement on the hazards of drinking and driving and volunteered to immediately enter rehab, Satriano said.

Review: Doctor Sleep,"Thirty-six years after introducing readers to Danny Torrance and a precognitive ability he came to call ""the shine,"" Stephen King is back with another creepy tale featuring the now adult Dan, a young girl named Abra and a mysterious group of soul-sucking creeps known as the True Knot.",,2013-09-25T13:27Z,"Consider this the sequel you never knew you were waiting for, but will be very glad it arrived.



Thirty-six years after introducing readers to Danny Torrance and a precognitive ability he came to call ""the shine,"" Stephen King is back with another creepy tale featuring the now adult Dan, a young girl named Abra and a mysterious group of soul-sucking creeps known as the True Knot.

Read ""The Shining"" first if you haven't already, but don't worry if it's been a few years or decades. King opens with a chapter called ""Prefatory Matters"" and deftly catches readers up with that novel. He begins ""Doctor Sleep"" with Dan starting fresh in New Hampshire after years of trying to outrun his demons. ""His mind was a blackboard. Booze was the eraser,"" writes King. Yes, he's an alcoholic like his late father, but unlike that mallet-wielding madman, he's finally ready to utter those words demanded by Alcoholics Anonymous: ""I need help.""

He finds it in part by becoming a mentor to 12-year-old Abra, whose shining is stronger than his own and who needs some protection from the voices and visions she can't always turn off in her head.

Here King has a little fun with pop culture's current obsession with vampires. Turns out those caravans of motor homes on America's highways or parked in a circle at a campground are nothing but a front for undead demons who survive by inhaling the ""steam"" that telepaths and seers like Dan and Abra give off.

They've been around for centuries, hiding in plain sight, and feasting on folks who shine.

The leader of the True Knot is one of King's best baddies in years - Rose O'Hara, aka Rosie the Hat - a 6-foot beauty fond of wearing a top hat and hellbent on sacrificing Abra for the survival of her species. King's a master at writing characters you love to hate. Rose is like Drago in ""Rocky IV,"" sneering and overconfident, and you can't wait for the inevitable showdown with Abra.

There are plenty of twists and turns along the way, and it all ends up at a familiar place in the Colorado mountains where Dan Torrance never thought he'd return. In keeping with tradition, King sprinkles in plenty of insider references to his fictional universe (Jerusalem's Lot is a favorite hangout for the True Knot, for instance) that will leave fans smiling.

Bottom line: If you loved ""The Shining,"" you'll love catching up with these characters. King is in fine form, making you laugh, grossing you out and spinning a tale that keeps the pages turning. If you've never read King, there are better starter novels in his canon, but you could do a lot worse than a double feature of ""The Shining"" followed by ""Doctor Sleep.""

"Twitter, Facebook and email are more addictive than cigarettes and alcohol","Staying unplugged from the rest of the world is unimaginable, but the Jammu and Kashmir deluge made the nightmare a reality for many of us. Wonder why staying unplugged leaves us powerless? Because Twitter and Facebook are more addictive than cigarettes and alcohol!",,2014-09-14T09:09Z,"Staying unplugged from the rest of the world is unimaginable, but the Jammu & Kashmir deluge has made the nightmare of being lost and going incommunicado a reality for many of us.

Also read: Jammu and Kashmir floods in 50 pics

The almost blanket week-long telecommunication and power outage in the flood-hit state has left the rest of the nation feeling equally powerless. People have gone crazy calling, messaging and mailing everyone they know in the state for news about people they know and people they don’t.

Things are no different in Jammu & Kashmir. The fact that there’s no network does not stop people from constantly trying to call, tweet, text or mail. And in areas where power is restored intermittently, the first thing people do is rush to recharge their cellphones, laptops and tablets, again knowing they couldn’t use them.

Full covergae: Flood fury hits Jammu & Kashmir

Staying unplugged leaves us powerless, and here’s why: Twitter, Facebook and email are more addictive than cigarettes and alcohol. A study of 205 people aged 18 to 85 in the German City of Wurtzburg found that sleep and sex were the two things people most long for during the day, but it was the urge to keep connected was the hardest to resist. The study found that the urge to stay on top of social media, email and work was stronger than the need to smoke or have a glass of 12-year-old single malt. The highest rates of “self-control failures” were tied to social-media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Google’s G+, LinkedIn and Groupon, reported researchers in Psychological Science (June 2012).

So compulsive is digital addiction that people prefer hurting themselves to sitting alone without their gadgets. People, especially men, hate being alone with their thoughts so much that they’d rather be in pain, reported the journal Science (July 2014). In the study, two-thirds men and a quarter of women were asked to sit alone for 15 minutes and let their mind wander. They chose to administer mild electrical shocks to themselves rather than sit doing nothing. One man gave himself mild shocks 190 times in 15 minutes.

Adults are more distracted by digital devices than young children, reported a study in Pediatrics. To find out how common it is for parents to use mobile devices around their children, Dr Jenny Radesky, a fellow in developmental behavioural paediatrics at Boston Medical Center in the US, surreptitiously observed 55 parents out for a meal alone with one or more children under 10 years. Most parents were found texting, swiping, scrolling or reading on their smartphone or tablet while the child fidgeted across the table.

Of the 55 parents, 40 used a cellphone during the meal, 16 used it throughout the meal. Three of them even gave a device to a child to keep the youngster occupied.

So strong was the smartphone/tablet pull for adults that even attempts to engage with them fell flat. In one instance, a little boy started singing ‘Jingle bells, Batman smells’ only to have his smartphone-clutching dad hush him. The boy did, but started singing again, which made his dad to look up just long enough to snap at him before going back to his phone.

Most updates and responses can wait unless, of course, your job depends on it. Checking social media and mailbox updates in social situations or more than once each waking hour is a sign of trouble. And if you reach out for your smartphone each time you wake up at night or the first thing in the morning, you seriously need to unplug your brain and slow down.

Unless it comes with the job, immediate communication is not as essential as believed. In fact, the reverse is true. Constantly switching between mails, updates and texts distracts and muddles the mind, lowering concentration and productivity.

If you want to reach digital nirvana, you’ve to start by admitting whether you have a problem. You don’t have to go quite the Alcoholics Anonymous way and say out loud, “My name is ABCD and I’m a digital addict”, but admitting it to yourself is a start.

As in quitting smoking, delaying the moment you feel an urge to check updates. Tell yourself you’ll do it in a few minutes and then gradually increase the time till you do it only at leisure. Another way to check compulsion is to use “technology breaks” every hour to read updates and then putting the gadget away to focus on work or conversation at hand.

Achieving zen in digital multitasking is not easy, but your mind needs to unplug more than you realise.

"India's gay law breeds intolerance, says UN chief","Speaking on a visit to the capital New Delhi, Ban said he 'staunchly opposed the criminalisation of homosexuality' referring to Section 377, India's colonial-era law, that prohibits gay sex.",,2015-01-13 11:26:00+00:00,"United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon has accused India of fomenting intolerance with its ban on gay sex amid uproar over a Goa minister's plans to make homosexuals ""normal"".

Speaking on a visit to the capital New Delhi, Ban said he ""staunchly opposed the criminalisation of homosexuality"" referring to Section 377, India's colonial-era law, that prohibits gay sex.

""I am proud to stand for the equality of all people--including those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender,"" the UN secretary general said in a statement late Monday.

""I speak out because laws criminalising consensual, adult same-sex relationships violate basic rights to privacy and to freedom from discrimination. Even if they are not enforced, these laws breed intolerance.""

The Supreme Court reimposed a ban on gay sex in late 2013, ruling that the responsibility for changing the 1861 law rested with lawmakers and not judges.

Gay sex had been effectively legalised in 2009 when the Delhi High Court ruled that banning ""carnal intercourse against the order of nature"" was a violation of fundamental rights.

Ban's comments came on the same day that a Goa minister, who belongs to the Bharatiya Janata Party, announced his plans to make gays ""normal"" in the state.

Ramesh Tawadkar, sports and youth affairs minister in Goa government, told reporters that he planned to open up centres on the lines of Alcoholics Anonymous to treat them.

""We will make them normal. We will have centres for them, like Alcoholic Anonymous centres,"" Tawadkar said, adding that the state would ""train them and give them medicines too"".

Tawadkar made the comments after releasing the state's policy on youth issues which listed lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders as a stigmatised group that needed attention.

Scene 1: A bleary-eyed Bond bundled in furs staggers out of Sheremetyevo airport, to be met by NSA agent Jinx Johnson. “The name is B—Bond…umm…er” says 007. What the devil was his first name, thinks Bond desperately. He’s been having these blackouts, moments when his mind went completely blank. He worries whether booze has softened his brain. Jinx laughs delightedly. “Ha, ha, James, pretending not to recognise me,” she says, punching him playfully. Bond doubles up in pain, clutching his paunch. Ever since his liver started acting up, he has a nagging pain in his gut. He calls M in London. “It’s bloody cold here,” complains Bond bitterly.

Scene II: “A splinter group of SPECTRE, called SPECTRE Taliban,” says General Gogol, “is all set to launch a nuclear warhead from Chechnya. We could arrange an aircraft to fly you out and airdrop you near the place.” Bond’s stomach gives a lurch. “No airdrops,” he protests, “all this running about has been terribly hard on my knees.” “Don’t worry, General,” says Jinx, “I’m sure James would prefer his Aston Martin, equipped with the usual missiles and machine guns.” Bond gulps, remembering the panic attack he had the last time he was in a fast car. They had given him a speeding ticket. He still had nightmares about it. “I would prefer to take the train,” he says.

Scene III: Gogol, Bond and Jinx are sitting at a bar near the railway station. “A vodka martini coming up, sir, shaken not stirred,” says the bartender. “I’ll have a diet Coke, thank you,” says Bond. General Gogol bursts out laughing. “Ah, this is your famous British sense of humour, eh?” he says. “So, what have you been doing?” asks Jinx. “Oh, I was in rehab for a year and I’ve joined Alcoholics Anonymous,” says Bond, picking up the Diet Coke with a shaking hand.

Scene IV: “The missile is in that hut,” points Jinx. James struggles to speak, as the climb up the hill has left him wheezing. “Bloody cigarettes,” he gasps. They hide behind a shed. “Shhh, what was that noise,” asks Jinx. “Oh, that was my stomach rumbling. Gas, you know,” says 007. He suddenly leaps up and starts shooting. “James, there’s nobody there,” cries Jinx. Bond stops shamefacedly, realising his hallucinations had started again.

Scene V: James is sweating, desperately trying to remember whether it was the red wire or the green one he had to cut to dismantle the nuclear device. He shuts his eyes and cuts a wire. Nothing happens and the clock counts down to zero. “Thank god I have my diapers on,” says Bond. Still nothing happens. The SPECTRE (Taliban) boss rushes in, takes one look at the nuclear device, at its prominent “Made in Pakistan” label and slaps his hand on his forehead, “Heck, I should have known it wouldn’t work,” he says, before tripping over a wire, striking his head against the missile and passing out.

Final scene: “My hero,” says Jinx, holding out her arms invitingly to Bond. Bond smiles, showing his tobacco-stained teeth. He farts and advances towards her, stopping only to pop a Viagra.

"Don’t protest under sun, it’ll darken your skin and hurt marital prospects: Goa CM to nurses","Goa chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar has allegedly advised protesting nurses not to stage a hunger strike under the hot sun as it could darken their complexion and affect their marital prospects, joining a growing list of ministers from the state who have drawn criticism for their public comments.",,2015-04-01T10:20Z,"Goa chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar has allegedly advised protesting nurses not to stage a hunger strike under the hot sun as it could darken their complexion and affect their marital prospects, joining a growing list of ministers from the state who have drawn criticism for their public comments.

Anusha Sawant, one of the protesting nurses, said: ""When we met the chief minister over our demands at Ponda (on Tuesday), he said the girls should not sit on hunger strike in hot sun as their complexion will become dark and they will not find a good bridegroom.

""The comment was unwarranted. We expect the CM to meet our demands if he is really worried about us,"" Sawant said.

Parsekar was not available for a reaction but an official in his office said: ""We have no idea whether any statement was made but we don't think he would say something like that.""

Nurses and others workers attached to a government-approved ambulance service run by a private firm are on hunger strike for the past few days.

They claimed the firm operates only 13 ambulances though it is being paid for 33. After their representatives met Parsekar twice, the nurses decided to confront him at every public function he attends.

""We also want to create awareness about the fraud committed by the company in connivance with government officials,"" said Hridaynath Shirodkar, the working president of Goa unit of Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh, which is affiliated to the Rashtriyaswayam Sevak Sangh.

In January, Goa's sports and youth affairs minister Ramesh Tawadkar attracted criticism and scorn from rights activists and opposition political parties when he said the state government was planning to set up centres to treat LGBT youngsters and make them ""normal"".

""We will make them normal…Like Alcoholics Anonymous centres, we will have centres. We will train them and give them medicines too,"" he had said.

Tawadkar did a U-turn after he was rapped for his ""ignorance"" by the chief minister, saying he was misquoted on the issue.

In July last year, Goa minister Sudin Dhavalikar sparked a controversy by calling for a ban on young girls wearing short skirts to nightclubs. ""Young girls wearing short skirts in nightclubs are a threat to the Goan culture,"" Dhavalikar told reporters.

Last month, Goa's assembly was informed by art and culture minister Dayanand Mandrekar that his department has barred its employees from wearing sleeveless clothes, jeans, T-shirts and multi-pocketed pants to office to ""maintain decorum"".

Beyond Goa, other politicians too have been criticised for their controversial remarks about women.

Last month, JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav had commented on the complexion of women from south India, drawing flak from activists and parliamentarians.

During a debate in parliament on the insurance bill, Yadav had said, ""Here people are awed by fair skin. Matrimonial ads also ask for fair skinned brides. The proposal to raise foreign investment is a symptom of this obsession.""

Despite DMK member Kanimozhi's objection to his comments, Yadav added: ""In the entire country there are more saanvle (dark skinned) men. The women of south are beautiful, their bodies...their skin ...We don't see it here. They know dance.""

When the issue was later raised in the House by HRD minister Smriti Irani, Kanimozhi and some others, Yadav remained defiant and unapologetic. But he later expressed regret over his comments against Irani.

High court says IAF ‘irresponsible’ for confining corporal to psychiatric ward without consent,"The Delhi high court told the Indian Air Force that the Mental Health Act had made it clear a person cannot be forced to undergo treatment without his consent, adding that the IAF “cannot ignore the laws of the country”",,2018-07-12T20:42Z,"The Indian Air Force (IAF) faced the ire of the Delhi High Court on for confining one of its non-commissioned officers, a corporal, to a psychiatric ward for over two months, because he was an alcoholic and suffered from mental disorders.

A bench of justices S Muralidhar and Vinod Goel questioned the rationale behind the IAF’s decision, asking how it determined on a daily basis that the corporal still “craved for alcohol”.

The court also said the newly-enacted Mental Health Act made it clear that a person could not be forced to undergo treatment without his consent, adding that the IAF “cannot ignore the laws of the country”.

Terming the conduct of the IAF “irresponsible”, the bench wondered how many of such cases there might be, which were yet to be highlighted.

“How were you determining on a daily basis that his craving for alcohol had not gone down? What tests were conducted by you? This is completely irresponsible. We wonder how many such cases are there.

“This is a clear case where a man is saying he has been detained without consent. Under the new Mental Health Act, you cannot force him to undergo treatment without his consent. Then how are you pumping him full of drugs? We do not know who should be proceeded against,” the bench said.

It added that the IAF needed to be reminded not to interfere with a person’s liberty as “short of chaining him up, everything else was done here” and directed that the corporal be produced in court tomorrow.

According to the IAF, represented by the Centre’s standing counsel, Ripudaman Singh Bhardwaj, the action against the corporal was taken on a complaint from his wife that he turned violent after consuming alcohol.

Bhardwaj said the corporal, Kriyad Yogesh Bhankhariya, had alcohol dependency issues for which he was initially treated in the psychiatric ward of the Army Base Hospital here and thereafter, in June, he was shifted to the medical centre at the Tughlakabad Air Force Station.

The court said if the non-commissioned officer (NCO) was an alcoholic, then the IAF ought to have sought the help of the “Alcoholics Anonymous” on how to deal with the matter as any psychiatric would confirm that confinement of a person was advisable only in extreme cases.

“It is worrying, the manner in which you have approached the situation,” the bench told the IAF.

The court was hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by the 30-year-old corporal’s father, claiming that his son was being illegally confined at the Army Base Hospital.

Peace march celebrates Silver Jubilee,Mumbai’s annual night-long march that crisscrosses the city gains strength and numbers; will be held this weekend.,,2013-03-15T13:31Z,"In 1988, when a group of 12 men decided to organise a march for peace in the city, little did they know that their small initiative would turn into a mini movement in the years to come. Called the All Night Walking Pilgrimage, the march, since then, has been held annually on one particular day during Lent (the 40-day period leading to Easter). Drawing thousands of Mumbaikars, it begins at night, covers a major portion of the city, and winds up by early morning. And this year, it will complete its silver jubilee.

For our first walk, we took inspiration from two organisations — Alcoholics Anonymous and Legion of Mary,” says 63-year-old Felix Dias, vice president of Marian Seva angh (MSS), a Christian body that has been organising the event. But the march itself has always been secular in its appeal, attracting people from all faiths and walks of life. “In the very first year itself, out of the about 1,500 people who participated, numerous were non-Christians,” informs Dias.

The only year that the organisers didn’t hold the march was in 1993 when the city witnessed communal violence.This year, the walk will be held on Saturday, March 16. Staying true to tradition, it will commence from Cross Maidan, Dhobi Talao, at 10 pm and then pass through Marine Lines, Opera House, Tardeo, Haji Ali, Siddhivinayak Temple, Portuguese Church, Mahim, Reclamation Hill Road, finishing at Mount Mary around 6 am.

There will be two halts along the way — one each at the Worli Sea Face and Dadar’s Portuguese Church — where refreshments are served for free to every participant.

Says Dias, “People get tired by the time they reach Dadar. So we serve them tea and biscuits, which are sponsored by donors.” The entire route is given police cover and there are ushers who guide pilgrims and direct traffic. “Annually about 25,000 people participate and we hope to get more people this time around,” says Dias.

Critics' review: Aashiqui 2 misses the quintessential romance,"The treatment and story of Aashiqui 2 has little new or fresh to offer.

Read for yourself what the critics think of the film.Mayank Shekhar finds the plot of the film confusing. He begins his review ridiculing the plot and says, ""This is a film on the dangers of alcohol addiction, subsequent loss of voice, and the end of a musical career."" He further clarifies, ""Alcoholic Anonymous and similar agencies that work on alcohol dependence issues should ideally co-opt this picture for their public service message. But they may not be quite satisfied with this effort.""Claiming to portray the sins of fame, Aashiqui 2 shows Aditya Roy Kapur as the arrogant famous singer who loses his career. For all the loss and sins of fame, the audience will not know the cause or the story of the protagonist's downfall.Shekhar also writes, ""It is a film about the transient nature of fame. The ideal subject could have been the original Aashiqui’s lead actors Rahul Roy and Anu Aggrawal themselves. BBC did a lovely documentary on the ""one-film wonder"" Roy. I met Aggrawal a couple of years ago, her face destroyed by a motor accident, her thoughts still pinned to her glorious past, she almost made me cry. Few people are likely to understand this tragic phenomenon called fame more than those who work in Bollywood that cruelly measures success and worth of artistes almost every week.""Why do I always feel that a lot of such characters should be seeing therapists rather than having films made on them? If this went on for any longer, I’d need to see a shrink too.**Mohit Suri has tried a ""terribly tried and tested"" method. Saibal writes that this 'old' plot does not have anything new to offer, ""Even the lead actors aren't newcomers, so do not expect them to inject any freshness.""Chatterjee further writes, ""The film is obviously meant for a youth audience, which is probably not the easiest segment to inveigle. Aditya Roy Kapoor, in his first full-fledged lead role, exudes the kind of confidence that borders on airiness. He is fine in the lighter moments, but when the drama turns intense, the chinks begin to show. There are situations in the plot that simply aren’t convincing enough, and the young actor can do little to extract something of significance out of them.""The film has sadly stirred up an old story filled it up with even older cliches and the lead pair perhaps does not have the ability yet to perform to cover up where the script lacks.Fluffy and flaky, Aashiqui 2 is simply not peppy enough to paper over its cracks. It does not strike any chords. There aren't too many highs in its hackneyed saga of songs and sighs.*1/2Madhureeta finds the movie pretty entertaining. She writes for her review, ""The real lyric of this story is their romance, pulsating with passion and intensity - on high notes and 'higher spirits'.""Aashiqui 2 does not hold any resemblance either to the 1990 film Aashiqui (to which Aashiqui 2 is claimed to be a sequel) nor can we spot any inspiration from Amitabh Bachchan-starrer Abhimaan. Mukherjee writes, ""Suri's musical love story doesn't bear much semblance to the original 'Aashiqui'; instead it finds its own rhythm.""As for the acting, ""Aditya is likeable in mushy moments, he shows intensity in flashes but sometimes loses grip. A mature role like this demands a lot, nonetheless, it's a good effort.""This could be good soup for the lovers' soul - with a dash of old-world flavour.***1/2The film certainly rides on high hopes with a title as Aashiqui 2, reminiscent of the 1990 film Aashiqui. Shomini writes, ""To make a film with the title 'Aashiqui 2' is not an easy thing as this name carries a baggage of superhit songs and innocent romance.""The film seems to have some misplaced direction as well, Sen writes, "" A beer bar has pictures of Lata Mangeshkar, Manna Dey on its walls. Okay then."" She further says that the movie is completely a predictable romantic film.Moving on to acting, Sen writes, ""Shraddha Kapoor looks beautiful throughout the film. But her performance is..well..too flat..But it's Aditya Roy Kapur who shines as the self destructive super star Rahul Jaykar.""Watch it for the shining star - Adita Roy Kapur.Sengar believes the film could have turned out better with a little more of an intelligent treatment. Resham writes, ""Remaking the 1990`s hit, Aashiqui, was a bright idea, given the adulation for the film still exists in the hearts of the audience. But sadly, Aashiqui 2 has not been given the kind of treatment that a classical on-screen romance should have been given.""The film also fails to even stand up to its title - Aashiqui (romance). Resham writes, ""Aashiqui 2 is quite a clean film unlike the ones that are churned out by the Vishesh Films` factory these days but the quintessential romance element is missing here.""Switching to acting skills of the artists, ""The passion between the lead pair is weakened mainly because of Shraddha Kapoor, who can neither emote nor act to intensify the romance. Instead, it is Aditya Roy Kapur who has tried to make things work in the film by being as real as possible while speaking his lines. He puts in genuine efforts to ignite the much-needed spark of passion between him and his on-screen lady love.""Aashiqui 2 must be watched only for three reasons: a) If you love Aditya Roy Kapoor; b) If the songs are of your liking; c) Just out of curiosity. Otherwise, watch the one starring Anu Agarwal and Rahul Roy and save money.**1/2Going by the reviews, Aashiqui 2 has little to offer if you are looking for a fresh story or awesome cinematic experience. However, Aditya Roy Kapur's acting seems promising. Watch the film, if you must, for Aditya Roy Kapur.Have you watched the movie yet? Share your experience with us.

Review: De Taali,"Actors Riteish Deshmukh, Ayesha Takia, Aftab Shivdasani were able to whip up some funny moments in the film but the lengthy script played a spoilsport, avers Khalid Mohamed.",,2008-06-20T20:33Z,"De Taali

Cast: Riteish Deshmukh, Ayesha Takia, Aftab Shivdasani

Direction: Eshwar Niwas

Rating: ** 1/2



Dim some, lose some. Practically every man, woman and even a dear golden-fur dog here is brain-challenged. One guy breakdances on the Bangkok streets (no one stops to watch, he’s that bad), another quaffs single malts at 8 am (no one gives him soda). And a girl smiles so widely that she could eat a banana (or two) sideways. Really.

According to director Eshwar Niwas (formerly just E Niwas), his nutzoid three pack are worth a De Taali. Are they? Frankly, the three do whip up some funny moments. Occasionally, they are likeable but regress far too often into plain nonsense and fiddlesticks. Blame it bole to.. on the here-there-everywhere script (co-written by Abbas Tyrewalla) or on the excessive length. Yawn the yawn, the second-half drags till your grey hair turns snow white. Sad.

Eshwar’s rom-com – which filches elements of the teen TV series Dawson’s Creek and My Best Friend’s Wedding – is hmmm..endurable. Actually you could do much worse, like seeing Niwas’ earlier efforts like Dum or Love ke Liye Kuch Bhi Karega? Or was it Marega?

Anyway, let’s be a bit positive, no? There’s a peppy appeal about Riteish Deshmukh who, knowingly or unknowingly (more likely the latter), follows the deadpan Buster Keaton-style of comedy. His reaction shots to chaos around him are as funny as a drunken sparrow. In the more dramatic sections though, he looks as if he wants to run away to the Himalayas. Oh well.

And when Ayesha Takia mimics Mr Deshmukh, she’s a delight; her laughter and smile are infectious. Wonderfully, she can also carry off the heavy-duty scenes too (take the one in which she talks of heartbreak). She’s an under-utilised actress for sure but could do by cutting down on potatoes and cream. Kilos hatao, please.

Aftab Shivdasani, well, um, okay, is not in the danger of getting the Lifetime Achievement Award two or three decades later. Rimi Sen, in a vamp-till-she-gets-cramps act, is quite cool for once. Miracle!

Now if you want to know what these actors are asked to do by the screenplay, don’t. Because a sane plotline is not on the agenda. It has something to do with falling in and out of love, friendship and Alcoholics Anonymous (represented by one bhoola bisra Mukul Dev). As for the finale, it’s set around a wedding pandal that should raise the ire of pundit mandals. Oh yes, there’s that golden dog, too, who refuses to carry out Anupam Kher’s instructions. Understandable.

The upbeat aspects involve a jibe at the permanently-lampoon-worthy Ram Gopal Varma ki Aag, the repartee between the three friends, fluid cinematography and the bright Bangkok locations.

So what’s the overall picture like? Okayish but so infuriatingly slow and tacky that it’s not likely to be remembered by anyone but poster-and-oddity collectors such as De Tulli.

"Avengers Endgame footage reveals how much time has passed since Infinity War, Thanos’ snap",Marvel fans wondering how much time has passed between the events of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame can stop speculating. Recently screened footage has revealed the answer.,,2019-04-07T18:32Z,"An important detail was revealed in the massive information dump that accompanied the screening of around 10 minutes of footage from Avengers: Endgame recently. It has been speculated that several years will have passed between the events of Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame, based on what the trailers have shown, but new reports suggest that the window between the end of Infinity War and the beginning of Endgame is much shorter.

Several journalists who were shown the footage in Los Angeles on Friday, ahead of the press junket for the movie, have reported that Endgame begins 22 days after the Decimation - the cataclysmic event at the end of Infinity War, after which Thanos snapped his fingers and half the world’s population was reduced to dust.

A Gamespot report says that the scene in which Tony Stark records a final message for Pepper Potts, while he’s stranded in space with Nebula, takes place just 22 days after the Decimation. It has been a source of constant speculation as to how Tony will return to Earth - perhaps he will be rescued by Pepper, or Captain Marvel - but the most recent trailer showed him back home. It remains unclear as to exactly when the scene takes place however, keeping in mind that time travel and alternate dimensions are likely to be introduced.

The trailers also showed how the survivors were dealing with the Decimation - Steve Rogers was shown at an Alcoholics Anonymous-type meeting, while expansive shots of refugees and mourners were also seen.

The same report added that while they were stranded in space, Tony and Nebula managed to repair the ship to a degree and even killed time by playing games.

Directors Joe and Anthony Russo have firmly refused to divulge any plot points from the film, billed as the epic conclusion to over a decade of Marvel Cinematic Universe films. They told ComicBook.com in a recent interview, “We really strongly commit to the storytelling that’s come before. We strongly commit to what’s happened to those characters in Winter Soldier, to the dividing of the Avengers in Civil War and the destruction of the relationship between Tony and Steve. The same way, we’re committing to the end of Infinity War. What we do is we track how each of those characters who survived, what is their relationship to those events? How do they move forward from that moment? How do they move forward, individually? Collectively? How do you deal with defeat as a super hero?”

"IndiGo off-duty pilots pose with whisky bottles, DGCA orders probe","Aviation regulator has asked low-cost carrier Indigo to investigate four pilots who posed for a photograph with a whisky bottle in an aircraft, citing safety concerns.",,2016-09-08T16:14Z,"Aviation regulator has asked low-cost carrier IndiGo to investigate four pilots who posed for a photograph with a whisky bottle in an aircraft, citing safety concerns.

It is not known if the pilots, who were not in uniform, were drunk when the picture was taken but the directorate general of civil aviation on Tuesday asked Indigo for an explanation.

Air safety rules prohibit pilots from drinking on duty. Alcohol tests are carried out before and after flights to check for violations that can invite suspension. A pilot stands to lose licence for repeat offences.

The airlines said it had carried out an internal investigation when it got to know of the incident and found no violations.

“As per the internal investigation – these pilots were on leave and were off duty hours, when this picture was clicked by them as regular travelers on an international flight,” an IndiGo spokesperson said on Wednesday. The liquor bottle was sealed.

The spokesperson said they informed the regulator when they got to know about the picture, which was taken in October 2013 and shared on Facebook in January. An anonymous complainant sent the picture to the DGCA on Tuesday.

“Drinking is permitted to passengers on international flights but passengers cannot drink from their own bottles. We have asked the airline to probe the matter and submit a report,” a DGCA official said.

A spokesperson, citing DGCA regulations, said the pilots were in the clear as regulator permits photography inside the aircraft. “The said pilots were not in uniform in the picture and it was an international flight where the consumption of alcohol is not prohibited,” the spokesperson said.

Traders in Uttarakhand feel heat as liquor sales miss target,"With the current financial year coming to an end, several liquor shop owners across the state are having a hard time to fill the government coffers",,2018-03-16T22:18Z,"With the current financial year coming to an end, several liquor shop owners across the state are having a hard time to fill the government coffers.

A liquor retail shop license holder in Nainital district said he was a tense man these days.

“For small investors like me, liquor is a loss making business. I am not able to sell the stock and the excise department forcing me to collect more quota as pay the fee,” said the trader who prefers to remain anonymous.

The BJP government had set a target of ₹2,310 crore revenue from the liquor business this year. So far, it has collected ₹2,100 crore.

With two weeks remaining before this financial year comes to an end, the target is unlikely to be achieved.

Excise minister Prakash Pant said the year has been a challenging owing to the Supreme Court directives to remove the liquor shops from the national highways.

The order was later relaxed for Uttarakhand and other hill states.

“We are roughly sort of ₹150 crore from the set target. But I am satisfied. The targets were scaled up and it will further stretch to ₹2,500 crore in the coming financial year,” the minister told Hindustan Times.

The government has also principally agreed to introduce the e-auctioning for the allotment of liquor shops. Pant said e-auctioning will ensure fair play in the business.

“Earlier the lottery system for the allotments of shop was adopted. But e-auctioning will altogether a different ball game. The shop will go the highest bidder. It’s a win-win situation for everyone” Pant said.

The government claims that e-auctioning of shops will also break the monopoly of “syndicate”.

However, there is no clarity whether government will also increase the retail price of different brand of liquors in a bid to fill the coffers.

“Increasing retail price will not help as a large number of cheap liquor is already being smuggled from Haryana into state. On the other hand, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand at present has similar price rates,” said a senior sales executive of a major liquor brand.

The minister agreed smuggling is pinching the industry and coffers. He, however, denied that anti-liquor movements erupted earlier were “genuine”.

According to industry insiders, people consume anything between 52 to 55 lakh cases of liquor every year in the hill state. A case comprises 12 bottles.

The political economy of a Nagaland election,"In Nagaland, there is almost a contract between voters and aspiring representatives: since you won’t do much between elections, we want benefits during elections",,2018-02-05T22:51Z,"“Four crore,” he said, describing his poll expense in 2013. “Of that, Rs2.8 crore was from my pocket. I got the rest from friends and family. My constituency has fewer than 2,5000 people. Yet, I came second.”

In a state in which political defections are the norm rather than exception, he had moved since the last election to a new party. He is once again preparing to contest in the Nagaland state assembly polls, slated for February 27.

“The lesson from last time is simply that my rival spent more than I did. I need to spend more — probably double, in the range of Rs7 or 8 crore.”

While a significant section of Naga civil society and political opinion has asked for a ‘solution’ to the larger Naga political issue before the polls, the Centre has made it clear that elections will be held. While discussing polls, the most common refrain one hears in the state is that money will have a great bearing on the outcome.

Elections everywhere in India are expensive affairs, and political finance is non-transparent. But in Nagaland, this seems to have assumed a different dimension with direct purchase of votes, turning around the logic of democracy where elected representatives are supposed to work for constituents once they win.

Here, as a party leader put it, there is almost a contract between voters and aspiring representatives: since you won’t do much between elections, we want benefits during elections. To tackle such malpractices, the Nagaland Baptist Church Council has started a ‘Clean Election Campaign’ and the Election Commission is strengthening its monitoring mechanisms.

Given the illegality of the practice, most interlocutors wished to remain anonymous.

The mechanics of vote-buying

He won as an independent in the last election and admitted the average cost per constituency was between Rs6-8 crore. What are the key expenditure sub-heads? “The first is direct purchase of votes. Households are given cash, depending on the number of people per household. It could be Rs10,000 for, say, a family of four or five.”

But this, he said, was a “gamble”.

“They could take the money and vote for someone else; they could take money from more than one candidate. It is a risk, but all of us have to take it. Since elections are so micro and the constituencies so small, you usually know who is voting where.”

The second key expense is paying off influential clan leaders — Nagaland has several tribes and sub clans — who control a substantial number of votes. “I may offer an elder who has 100 votes a few lakhs. He may tell me he’s getting Rs5 lakh from another candidate. I then make a counter offer.”

The final key expense, often seen in elections elsewhere, is an inducement in kind. “Giving bikes and cars to young supporters ends up costing a fair bit. And then there is the food and drink.”

Nagaland has prohibition, yet there is rampant illegal distribution of alcohol. During elections, it becomes more expensive.

“A bottle costing Rs140 goes for Rs500. And people start demanding a bottle each day for 15 days in the run-up to elections. And then you organise feasts,” explained the independent politician. “But it is fine. It is all worth it.”

The voter-politician contract

“It is worth it for politicians,” says Kesosul Christopher Ltu, president of Naga Student Federation, the umbrella organisation of student unions in the state, “because they use the expenses during the elections to do nothing after elections”.

Ltu says, “MLAs get development funds. But a lot of expenditure is skimmed off. Their excuse is voters have already taken money during elections. But voters really get a very, very small slice of the cake. The cake is eaten up by the political elite here.”

A local journalist has a similar explanation.

“There is little governance. The political elite disappears for the most part. This is the only opportunity for voters to extract something. It is now a vicious cycle.”

Officially, political leaders say Nagaland is not unique. A Kikon, spokesperson of the ruling Naga People’s Front, said, “If you compare it to elections in South India, it is not expensive. Yes, we cannot deny there are expenses involved. But it is not fair to allege that every Naga household is subject to purchase. They do vote for principles, leaders, candidates.”

‘Ethical and informed voting’

Abhijit Sinha, chief electoral officer of Nagaland, admits there is a problem. “There have been a lot of complaints about high expenditure and monetary inducements. We are aware of the matter.”

To deal with it, Sinha says the EC has adopted a two-pronged approach this time. “We are strengthening our regulatory and monitoring mechanisms. There will be a substantial increase in the number of Election Expenditure Observers. We will have over 90 check-posts and a minimum of three flying squads per constituency.” Sinha also said the other component was focusing on behavourial change through voter orientation camps to encourage “ethical and informed voting”.

Privately, leaders remain cynical that initiatives like Clean Election Campaign or the EC’s efforts will have much impact.

A BJP strategist for the region said, “It is a ritual to give money during elections. Giving it is no guarantee of victory but not giving it means defying the ritual and losing for sure. Voters and politicians have reached an arrangement, a compromise.” In the easternmost corner of India, this compromise reflects distortions in Indian democracy.

‘We began to run’: Students describe horror of Oregon shooting,"When a 26-year-old man armed with multiple guns walked into a morning writing class in rural Oregon, and opened fire, the students at the community college had no clue what was hitting them - bullets!",,2015-10-02T22:31Z,"When a 26-year-old man armed with multiple guns walked into a morning writing class in rural Oregon, and opened fire, the students at the community college had no clue what was hitting them - bullets!

One witness said the attacker demanded to know students’ religion before shooting them.

Students in a classroom next door heard several shots, one right after the next, and their teacher told them to leave.

“We began to run,” student Hannah Miles said. “A lot of my classmates were going every which way. We started to run to the center of campus. And I turned around, and I saw students pouring out of the building.”

At least nine people were killed and seven others wounded on Thursday, the fourth day of classes at Umpqua Community College in this former timber town 180 miles south of Portland. The worst mass shooting in recent Oregon history was raising questions about security at the college with about 3,000 students.

“I suspect this is going to start a discussion across the country about how community colleges prepare themselves for events like this,” former college president Joe Olson said.

The killer was identified as Chris Harper Mercer, according to a government official who was not authorized to speak publicly and provided the name on condition of anonymity. Mercer died after a shootout with police, who were not saying whether they knew of any motive.

He had body armor and was armed with three pistols, a rifle and five additional magazines, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said in an incident report obtained by The Associated Press. The guns included a 9mm Glock pistol and .40-caliber Smith & Wesson, both traced to the suspect.

He also had a .40-caliber Taurus pistol traced to someone in Portland and a .556-caliber Del-Ton.

Mercer is not believed to have a criminal history. Investigators believe he may have been a student at the college because a receipt found at the scene showed he purchased textbooks from the campus bookstore two days before the shooting.

He lived in an apartment complex in nearby Winchester, where investigators found a number of firearms, Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin said on Friday. Details about the number and type of guns would be released later, he said.

A neighbor, Bronte Harte, told The Associated Press that Mercer “seemed really unfriendly” and would “sit by himself in the dark in the balcony with this little light.”

Harte said a woman she believed to be Mercer’s mother also lived upstairs and was “crying her eyes out” on Thursday.

Social profiles linked to Mercer suggested he was fascinated by the IRA, frustrated by traditional organized religion and tracked other mass shootings.

There didn’t seem to be many recent connections on the social media sites linked to Mercer, with his MySpace page just showing two friends.

In addition to the MySpace page, Mercer appeared to have at least one online dating profile, a torrents streaming account and a blog.

On a torrents streaming site and blog that appeared to belong to Mercer, posts referenced multiple shootings and downloads included several horror films and a documentary on a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. A blog post urged readers to watch the online footage of Vester Flanagan shooting two former colleagues on live TV in Virginia, while another lamented materialism as preventing spiritual development.

A MySpace page that appeared to belong to Mercer included several photos and graphics of the Irish Republican Army as well as a picture of Mercer holding a rifle.

Mercer previously lived in the Los Angeles-area suburb of Torrance with his mother. Neighbors there recalled him as uncommunicative.

His father, Ian Mercer, said late on Thursday that it’s been a “devastating day” for him and his family, and he has been talking to police and the FBI about the shooting. He spoke to KABC-TV and several other media outlets gathered outside his house in Tarzana, California.

Step-sister Carmen Nesnick said the shooting didn’t make sense.

“All he ever did was put everyone before himself, he wanted everyone to be happy,” she told KCBS-TV.

Hanlin, the sheriff, said on Thursday that he was not going to say the shooter’s name because that’s what he would have wanted.

“I will not name the shooter. I will not give him the credit he probably sought prior to this horrific and cowardly act,” said a visibly angry Hanlin.

Hundreds went to a candlelight vigil on Thursday night, with many raising candles as the hymn “Amazing Grace” was played.

Sam Sherman, a former student, said the school helped broaden his opportunities.

“That’s all I could think about today. There’s 10, 9 kids who won’t get those doors opened,” he said.

Roseburg is in Douglas County, a politically conservative region west of the Cascade Range where people like to hunt and fish. But it’s no stranger to school gun violence. A freshman at the local high school shot and wounded a fellow student in 2006.

After Thursday’s shooting, anguished parents and other relatives rushed to surviving students.

Jessica Chandler was desperately seeking information about her 18-year-old daughter, Rebecka Carnes.

“I don’t know where she is. I don’t know if she’s wounded,” Chandler said.

Carnes’ best friend told Chandler that her daughter had been flown by helicopter to a hospital.

Students described utter fear and panic after hearing the shots.

Sarah Cobb, 17, was in a next-door classroom. She heard a shot. A teacher said they needed to get out, and the class ran out the door as she heard two more shots.

“I was freaking out. I didn’t know what to think, what to do,” she said.

Before the Roseburg shooting, a posting on the message-board site 4chan included a photo of a crudely drawn frog used regularly in Internet memes with a gun and warned other users not to go to school on Thursday in the Northwest.

The messages that followed spoke of mass shootings, with some egging on and even offering tips to the original poster. It was unclear if the messages were tied to the shooting because of the largely anonymous nature of the site.

Investigators went door to door in the neighborhoods near the college and the shooter’s apartment seeking clues, Hanlin said on Friday.

The sheriff has been vocal in opposing state and federal gun-control legislation. In 2013, Hanlin sent a letter to Vice President Joe Biden after the shooting at a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school, declaring that he and his deputies would refuse to enforce new gun-control restrictions “offending the constitutional rights of my citizens.”

Oregon gunman: US Army dropout who researched mass shootings,"The 26-year-old gunman who opened fire on his fellow students at their community college English class, killing eleven people, was a US Army boot camp dropout who had extensively studied mass shooters before becoming one himself.",,2015-10-03T08:39Z,"The 26-year-old gunman who opened fire on his fellow students at their community college English class, killing 11 people, was a US Army boot camp dropout who had extensively studied mass shooters before becoming one himself.

A day after the rampage in the Oregon timber town, authorities said that Christopher Sean Harper-Mercer wore a flak jacket and brought at least six guns and five ammunition magazines to the school. Investigators found another seven guns at the apartment he shared with his mother.

Officials on Friday also released the names of the dead, who ranged in age from 18 to 67 and included several freshmen and a teacher. They were sons and daughters, spouses and parents.

One of the students was active in the Future Farmers of America and loved to play football. Another was on only his fourth day of college. One was a 59-year-old student whose daughter was enrolled in the same school but not injured the shooting. Grieving families began sharing details of their loved ones.

“We have been trying to figure out how to tell everyone how amazing Lucas was, but that would take 18 years,” the family of Lucas Eibel, 18, said in a statement released through the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office.

Eibel, who was studying chemistry, volunteered at a wildlife centre and animal shelter.

Quinn Glen Cooper’s family said their son had just started college and loved dancing and voice acting.

“I don’t know how we are going to move forward with our lives without Quinn,” the Coopers said. “Our lives are shattered beyond repair.”

Seven other people were wounded in the attack in Roseburg, about 180 miles south of Portland.

Harper-Mercer, who died during a shootout with police, was armed with handguns and a rifle, some of which were military grade. The weapons had been purchased legally over the past three years, some by him, others by relatives, said Celinez Nunez, assistant field agent for the Seattle division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

Oregon’s top federal prosecutor says the shooter used a handgun when he opened fire on classmates and stashed a rifle in another room and did not fire it. He says it’s impossible to know what the shooter had planned for the rifle.

Those who knew the shooter described an awkward loner.

At a different apartment complex where Harper-Mercer and his mother lived in Southern California, neighbours remembered a quiet and odd young man who rode a red bike everywhere.

Reina Webb, 19, said the man’s mother was friendly and often chatted with neighbours, but Harper-Mercer kept to himself. She said she occasionally heard him having temper tantrums in his apartment.

“He was kind of like a child so that’s why his tantrums would be like kind of weird. He’s a grown man. He shouldn’t be having a tantrum like a kid. That’s why I thought there was something - something was up,” she said.

Harper-Mercer’s social media profiles suggested he was fascinated by the Irish Republican Army and frustrated by traditional organised religion. He also tracked other mass shootings. In one post, he appeared to urge readers to watch the online footage of Vester Flanagan shooting two former colleagues live on TV in August in Virginia, noting “the more people you kill, the more you’re in the limelight.”

He may have even posted a warning. A message on 4chan - an online forum where racist and misogynistic comments are frequent - warned of an impending attack, but it’s unclear if it came from Harper-Mercer.

“Some of you guys are alright. Don’t go to school tomorrow if you are in the northwest,” an anonymous poster wrote a day before the shootings.

On Thursday morning, he walked into Snyder Hall at Umpqua Community College and began firing, shooting many victims repeatedly. Survivors described a classroom of carnage, and one said he ordered students to state their religion before shooting them.

Students in a classroom next door heard several shots, one right after the other, and their teacher told them to leave.

“We began to run,” student Hannah Miles said. “A lot of my classmates were going every which way. We started to run to the centre of campus. And I turned around, and I saw students pouring out of the building.”

An aunt of an Army veteran hit by several bullets said he tried to stop the gunman from entering the classroom.

Wanda Mintz said her 30-year-old nephew, Chris Mintz, a student at the college, fell to the floor and asked the shooter to stop. But, she said, he shot Mintz again and went inside.

Portland Fire and Rescue Lt. Rich Chatman, who is serving as a spokesman for the criminal investigation, said investigators were still processing the crime scene.

Several years ago, Harper-Mercer moved to Winchester, Oregon, from Torrance, California, with his mother, a nurse named Laurel Harper. His father, Ian Mercer, originally from the United Kingdom, told reporters outside his Tarzana, California, home, “I’m just as shocked as anybody at what happened.”

At school in Oregon, “he was a typical Roseburg kid, kind of nerdy, kind of out there. Just himself,” said Alex Frier, a stage manager at the college who said Harper-Mercer built sets for theatre performances last semester.

A neighbour, Bronte Harte, said Harper-Mercer “seemed really unfriendly” and would “sit by himself in the dark in the balcony with this little light.”

Harte said a woman she believed to be Mercer’s mother also lived upstairs and was “crying her eyes out” Thursday.

The Army said Harper-Mercer flunked out of basic training in 2008.

Army spokesman Lt. Col. Ben Garrett said Harper-Mercer was in the military for a little over a month at Ft. Jackson, South Carolina, but was discharged for failing to meet the minimum standards.

Garrett did not say which standards Harper-Mercer failed. Generally, the Army requires recruits to pass physical fitness tests and to be in generally good physical and mental health. Recruits must also pass a multiple-choice test covering science, math, reading comprehension and other topics.

In Washington, President Barack Obama lamented the government’s inability to pass stricter gun laws even after attacks like the one in Oregon.

At a news conference Friday at the White House, Obama said he plans to keep talking about the issue and “will politicize it” because inaction is itself a political decision the US is making.

He said it’s impossible to identify mentally ill people likely to perpetrate mass shootings ahead of time. The only thing the US can do, he explained, is ensure they don’t have an arsenal available “when something in them snaps.”

British-born Carrie Reichert reportedly had been handpicked with nine other girls to join Harry in his penthouse suite, but soon the royal heart-throb led her away, so that they could be together.



“We kissed, he was naked at the time, and pretty open. It was a drunken fumble. It wasn’t romantic, just fun,” the Mirror quoted Reichert as saying.



“He was a gentleman, but he was so wasted. The alcohol affected him. I was there for 15 to 20 minutes,” she said.

The 32-year-old beautician is the only one to have come forward to share her side of story of what happened on the now-infamous night when Harry, 27, was caught on camera frolicking naked with a girl after a game of “strip billiards.”

Reichert said that she took off her dress to reveal her bikini and kissed him.

“We both walked back ­together, and he grabbed my hand and walked back toward his bedroom. I found my way back there with him,” she said.

They then did, what she described, as a “drunken fumble.”

“We kissed for 15 to 20 minutes. I am sure somebody stumbled in as there were people going in and out of rooms all the time. We kissed again and he said ‘That was great,’” Reichert revealed.

“He told me I was beautiful and gorgeous, which was sweet. Then we kind of nonchalantly returned to the party and kept drinking. We went back into the living area and I assumed people knew but everyone acted like nothing happened.

“A little bit after some girls passed out on seats, and I felt I needed to go back to my room so I did,” she added.

Black Hawk Down actor Tom Sizemore accused of touching 11-year-old co-star’s genitals,Actor Tom Sizemore was allegedly removed from set after an incident in which an 11-year-old actor alleged that he had touched her inappropriately.,,2017-11-14T12:22Z,"Actor Tom Sizemore was allegedly removed from set after an incident in which an 11-year-old actor alleged that he had touched her inappropriately. The Hollywood Reporter says that 12 people who worked on the set of the 2003 movie Born Killers confirmed that Sizemore had indeed been sent home and tensions were high.

According to the report, Sizemore, then 42, was sent home after the young actor’s parents complained to the producers that he had allegedly touched her genitals. Sizemore was reportedly spoken to and replied, “I’ve done a lot of awful things, and I’d never do anything with kids.”

Sizemore has had multiple run-ins with the law. He was convicted of assaulting several women, and is known to be an abuser of alcohol and drugs.

Several people who worked on the movie provided their accounts of what transpired. Charles Lago of DTLA Entertainment Group, who was Sizemore’s manager until his assault convictions said he was “not surprised.”

“He’s the most abhorrent person I’ve ever met in my life,” Lago said. “I heard something happened on the set but I didn’t realize it involved a child. It was hushed up.”

The actor in question is now 26, and requested to remain anonymous. She said she has hired a lawyer to take action against Sizemore and her parents.

The incident occurred during a promotional photo session which required the young actor to sit on Sizemore’s lap. “This is when Sizemore allegedly either rubbed his finger against the girl’s vagina or inserted it inside,” THR reported.

Actor Robyn Adamson recalls the photoshoot, and the young actor’s reaction. At one point her eyes got just huge, like she could’ve vomited,” Adamson said. “I was watching her. She soon reintegrated and kept going, although she had trouble taking direction. Later, when I was told about what happened, I knew exactly what it was.”

“There was never any doubt,” production assistant Roi Maufas said. “He was this guy who was already known for making inappropriate comments, being drunk, being high. We’re talking about consistent behaviour, just being ‘Tom Sizemore’ on set every day. Then this happens. Guys reached for hammers.”

The film’s casting director complained to the legal department of the Screen Actor’s Guild to have Sizemore removed from the project immediately.

The young actor’s parents did not file a police complaint, and Sizemore returned to the sets for reshoots. The actor is known for playing tough guys in films such as Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan.

Walking with the wolves,"Her father and husband always fear for her safety, yet are supportive of her crusade against molesters. Her advice: Don’t back down, report the offenders. Shara Ashraf writes.",,2013-01-11T23:44Z,"Every single year since I moved to Delhi in 2004, I find myself walking into a police station. The annual date with molesters and insensitive police officers creeps up on me like a birthday or anniversary, so unrelenting is its regularity. My mind and body have become the Richter scale — registering pain, anger, vulnerability, insecurity and helplessness at the same time.





My friends say I’m privileged; that as a journalist I can pull strings. I say no. I’m just another girl in Delhi: A professional, a happy wife and young mother.



On October 30, 2012, I left home at 9.30am for my office from Pandav Nagar in east Delhi. I reached the main road, barely 100 yards away from my home, looking for an auto.

60,000 suggestions and more pouring in

Fifteen minutes later, as I started walking to the Mother Dairy stand to get a bus, I noticed three middle-aged MCD employees sitting on the stairs of a shop.They started singing a Hindi film song at the top of their voice. My stern look didn’t deter them.They made lewd gestures as well. I ignored them but suddenly, much to my shock, one of them (about 50, one-eyed and wore an MCD cap), got up and looking at his friends remarked in Hindi that I looked like a girl who was great at a particular sexual act.

His friends remarked, grinning, “Ask her if we too could join.”

I could literally feel my blood boiling but I forced myself to keep walking quietly.



After a few steps, I could still hear them giggling. I could not bear it any longer. I went back to where they were sitting. They seemed shocked. Very calmly, I asked them what was it they wanted to ask me.



The one-eyed man started stammering and said they were talking about someone else. There was a strong smell of alcohol and I realised he was drunk.

Enter the cops

I dialed 100 and narrated what had happened. The control room guy asked me to wait where the incident had taken place, and assured me that he was sending a vehicle. I stood close to a shop, keeping a watch on the three men. They were confused if I had really made the call to the cops or was just trying to scare them.



The PCR vehicle came in about 20 minutes. The MCD employees were still around. When I told the sub-inspector what had happened, he called the one-eyed man, who denied having passed any lewd comments.



The cop was reluctant to register a complaint. He had a smirk on his face when he read my name along with my husband’s in my complaint which I wrote on the spot. “Shara Ashraf, W/O Abhishek Khokhar? Yeh kaise ho sakta hai?” he asked.

“Kyunki yeh India hai,” I told him, and he looked lost.



He tried explaining to me that since these men are MCD employees and are drunk on duty, they will lose their jobs if I file a FIR.



“Jaane dijiye madam, yeh sweepers hain, gande log hain, naukri chali jayegi to inke bachchon ki bad dua lagegi aap ko (Let it be. They are drunk on the job and if they lose their jobs, their kids will curse you),” he said.



He relented when I told him I was a journalist.

Later at the police station I was called inside a small, dingy room where some cops were sleeping on charpoys, their clothes hanging on the walls. There was no woman constable. A male colleague and I waited for the sub-inspector, who finally came with the local MCD supervisor who apologised.



He requested me to withdraw my complaint. I agreed but only after they had stated in writing that they would never harass a girl again. I left, feeling less violated. At least I had a written apology.

Delhi govt favours public humiliation of accused in rape cases



Loose character?

In 2007, when I was a trainee with the Asian Age, I got a message in the middle of the night from an unknown number. I froze as I read the Hindi text. It went something like this: If they show legs in a waxing ad, cheeks in an anti-pimple cream ad, why not the relevant part of the anatomy in a sanitary napkin ad?

When I called up on the number in the morning, no one picked up. I then had a friend call up on the number from a PCO. When a guy picked up, I told him that I had received a highly vulgar message from his phone. He denied and disconnected. I went to the Malviya Nagar police station and lodged an FIR.



The cops took turns reading the message and grinning. They assured me they would summon the subscriber of the telephone number that evening. The subscriber turned out to be a make-up artist who was an acquaintance.



I used to do part-time modelling back then, and this guy had seemed to be very well-behaved and decent. He had come to the set of a studio where I was shooting a TV commercial. He came to the police station with some of my photographs.

My pictures turned the situation completely in his favour. The photos were displayed on the table for other cops to have a look at.



“Aap ne to kaha aap paper mein hain, par aap to model hain madam (You told us you worked in a newspaper, but you turned out to be a model),” he said mockingly.



The guy who had sent me the message kept on insisting that it was a joke, while I kept saying that I was deeply offended by its content, and I want him to be punished. After the argument, I was forced to leave.



Police start poster drive to deter potential criminals



Court matters

In August 2011, I had barely walked out of my office on Kasturba Gandhi Marg when I noticed two men following me. They spoke loudly and wanted me to hear their conversation.

“Does every woman’s anatomy look the same?” the taller guy asked the shorter one in Hindi. “How many have you seen so far?”

“Let’s ask her about hers,” was the last remark.

When I turned, I saw them laughing. I totally lost my cool. I went up to them and asked: “Haven’t you seen your mom’s?”

They didn’t expect this. They started running. I ran after them, and while the taller guy managed to escape, I was able to catch the shorter one. There was a police parked close by, and I dragged the guy to it.

I told the cops that his friend had passed a very lewd remark. The SHO said I must go ahead with the complaint to teach them a lesson. I agreed.



I got called to the court within a year, and will be going to Patiala Court for the third hearing first week of April. My lawyer father and husband, who often fear for my safety, are very supportive. The brutal gang rape in Delhi on December 16 has only made me more determined. My advice: Report the offenders. It acts as a deterrent.
